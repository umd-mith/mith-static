    "wp post content": "The <a title=\"MITH\" href=\"http://mith.umd.edu\">Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities</a> at the University of Maryland and the <a title=\"NDIIPP\" href=\"http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/index.php\">National Digital Information Infrastructure Program</a> at the Library of Congress are pleased to announce that they will serve as co-hosts of the 2013 Personal Digital Archiving Conference in conjunction with the <a title=\"University Libraries\" href=\"http://www.lib.umd.edu/\">University of Maryland Libraries.</a>\n\nTo be held February 21st and 22nd, 2013, PDA provides a two-day-long opportunity for researchers and practitioners in the field of personal archiving to convene for presentations and networking. The conference supports a broad community of practitioners working to ensure long term access for various personal collections and archives. “We were thrilled to be approached by Jeff Ubois and NDIIPP to co-host the 2013 conference. The mix of academic, commercial, and independent researchers at PDA forms a unique and engaged community devoted to curating and preserving the rich record of contemporary life in digital form,” noted Trevor Muñoz, Associate Director of MITH and Assistant Dean for Digital Humanities Research at the University of Maryland Libraries.\n\n“Everything is lining up for a great conference,” said Bill LeFurgy, Digital Initiative Projects Manager with NDIIPP. “Interest in personal digital archiving is growing fast in our culture and we are looking forward to a stimulating exchange of ideas among different communities.”\n\nThrough projects on preserving virtual worlds and born-digital literary materials as well as the application of digital forensics to cultural heritage collections, MITH has demonstrated a sustained engagement with digital preservation and data curation. NDIIPP is leading a national strategy to build the capacity for public and private organizations across the United States to save digital content of current and future value to the nation. The University of Maryland Libraries have committed to a focus on digital stewardship and e-research with new staff and new initiatives aimed at complementing the libraries physical collections with new services that help define the role of a 21st-century land grant university. Bringing PDA to the Washington, D.C., area has great potential to expand and enrich the interactions of conference participants by drawing individual attendees not just from the strong community that has developed over the past three years but also from academic community, cultural heritage institutions located in the region.\n\nA call for proposals will be released in late August and submissions will be accepted until early November 2012. All submissions to Personal Digital Archiving 2013 will be peer-reviewed by an international program committee. Registration for PDA 2013 will open in early December.\n\nPDA 2013 will be held on the University of Maryland campus in College Park on February 21st and 22nd, 2013.

    "wp post content": "The Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) is very pleased to announce the release of a new Web site showcasing the Deena Larsen Collection we house and maintain:\n\n<a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/research/deena-larsen-collection/\" target=\"_blank\">mith.umd.edu/larsen</a>\n\nDeena Larsen, whose best-known works include the hypertexts Marble Springs and Samplers (both published by Eastgate Systems), has been active in the creative electronic writing community nearly since its inception in the early 1980s. She has also been a collector and de facto archivist for that community, amassing what she has described as electronic literature's \"Great Library of Alexandria.\" In May 2007 she gave MITH the extraordinary gift of her personal collection of early-era computers, software, and digital files.\n\nThe collection includes not only Deena's own extensive literary output, but original and sometimes unpublished material by nearly every author in her circle, effectively making it a cross-section of electronic writing during its key formative years (roughly 1985-1995). The hardware in the collection consists of five Mac Classics, two Mac SEs, and a Mac Plus, and associated accessories; the physical media includes some 800 diskettes, as well as nearly 100 CD-ROMs and Zip disks. The collection also contains manuscripts, newspaper clippings, books, comics, manuals, notebooks, syllabi, catalogs, brochures, posters, conference proceedings, and ephemera. According to Matthew Kirschenbaum, Associate Director of MITH and Associate Professor of English at Maryland, \"The arrival of Deena's collection at MITH furnishes us with invaluable source material which will further our in-house research in digital curation and preservation, as well as function as a unique resource for the growing number of researchers interested in early hypertext and electronic literature.\"\n\nThe site, built with Omeka, was designed by Amanda Visconti of the University of Michigan under the auspicies of the IMLS-funded Digital Humanities Model Internship program, which places iSchool students in working digital humanities centers. Kari Kraus, director of the program and Assistant Professor in Maryland's iSchool and English department, comments: \"Amanda's work is a great example of the kind of collaboration and mutual exchange we're working to promote.\"\n\nWith this announcement we are also opening the collection to scholars on a limited basis. Researchers interested in visiting Maryland to work with the Larsen materials on site should write to us at mith at umd dot edu.",

OARD, College of Information Studies and UMIACS, University of Maryland\r\r\n\r\r\nIn this talk I will describe the goals of the MALACH project (Multilingual Access to Large Spoken Archives) and some of our research results. I'll begin by describing the unique characteristics of the oral history collection that we are using, in which Holocaust survivors, witnesses and rescuers were interviewed in several languages. Each interview has been digitized and extensively catalogued by subject matter experts, thus producing a remarkably rich collection for the application of machine learning techniques.\r\r\n\r\r\nAutomatic speech recognition techniques originally developed for the domain of conversational telephone speech were adapted to process with word error rates that are adequate to support interactive search and automated clustering, detection of topic shifts, and topic classification. In this talk, I will describe the studies that we conducted to learn about what needs our systems should be designed to\r\r\nmeet and I'll summarize key results from our system development activities. I'll conclude with some remarks about possible future directions for research applying new technologies to improve intellectual access to oral history and other spoken word collections.\r\r\n\r\r\nDouglas Oard is Associate Dean for Research in the College of Information Studies at the University of Maryland. An Associate Professor in the College, he holds a joint appointment in the Institute for Advanced Computer Studies (UMIACS) and affiliate appointments in the Computer Science Department and the Applied Mathematics and Scientific Computation Program. Dr. Oard earned his Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Maryland, and his research interests center around the use of emerging technologies to support information seeking by end users. Recent work has focused on interactive techniques for cross-language information retrieval, searching conversational media, and leveraging observable behavior to improve user modeling.

    "wp post content": "A MITH Digital Dialogue\n\nTuesday, October 28, 12:30-1:45\n\nMITH Conference Room, McKeldin Library\n\n\"War (and) Games\" (discussion)\n\nBy Matthew Kirschenbaum (English and MITH)\n\nA conversation about the long history and seemingly unlikely combination of warfare and gaming, and the representation of war and militarism in computer and board games (for example, the official Pentagon recruiting game America's Army). Questions to consider might include: how can the procedural mechanisms of a game capture the chaos of lived experience that is a battle? What are the ethics of \"playing\" with war? How do we evaluate the professionalization of gaming and simulation in relation to modernity? How do games function as sites of resistance or mobilization among \"Generation Kill\" (the title of the recent book and miniseries by Evan Wright and David Simon)? This will be an exploratory roundtable discussion for those interested in the topic, not a lecture. Professor Kirschenbaum will have examples on display from his personal collection of several hundred boardgames; attendees are likewise encouraged to bring copies of games they would like to discuss. Part of the ARHU semester on War and Representations of War (www.war.umd.edu).\n\nMatthew Kirschenbaum is an Associate Professor in the Department of English at the University of Maryland. He is also an affiliated faculty member with the Human-Computer Interaction Lab at Maryland, and a Vice President of the Electronic Literature Organization.  Kirschenbaum specializes in digital humanities, electronic literature, virtual worlds, serious games and simulations, textual studies, and postmodern/experimental literature. His first book, Mechanisms: New Media and the Forensic Imagination, was published by the MIT Press in 2008. Much of his work at MITH now focuses on born-digital archiving and preservation: he is principal investigator for the NEH funded start-up \"Approaches to Managing and Collecting Born-Digital Literary Materials for Scholarly Use\" and is also a co-investigator on an NDIIPP-funded project devoted to Preserving Virtual Worlds.  He oversees work on the Deena Larsen collection, a vast personal archive of hardware and software furnishing a cross-section of the electronic writing community during its key formative years, roughly 1985-1995. He is Articles Editor for Digital Humanities Quarterly and serves on the editorial or advisory boards of a number of projects and publications, including Postmodern Culture, Text Technology, Textual Cultures, and MediaCommons. He is a regular contributor to the Chronicle Review section of the Chronicle of Higher Education.

    "wp post content": "According to Christina Wodtke and Austin Govella in <em>Information Architecture: Blueprints for the Web</em>, wireframes are the spaces in which thinking becomes tangible. As my semester-long exploration of digital scholarly editions comes to a close, I have been thinking about how to synthesize the insights I’ve gleaned from the different phases of the project—from the literature review to the TEI encoding guidelines—into a set of visual representations, or wireframes, for a digital edition of Katherine Anne Porter’s letters. In other words, I have been attempting to transform my thinking into something tangible.\n\n\n\nBut I’ve also been reflecting on the connections—and the gaps—between thought, (research, intellectual endeavor) and the tangible (the physical, the authentic object). Archivists have long been preoccupied with the authenticity of the original object, the power of evidence, of historical aura. And in so many ways, archivists have been attempting to connect their tangible collections with the thinking that preoccupies researchers and scholars. Archives, then, are also spaces in which thought becomes tangible (Porter’s letters are the tangible incarnation of her thought) and the tangible becomes thought (scholars interface with her letters and transform the physical paper into their own intellectual discoveries).\n\n\n\nArchive as wireframe? The reading room offers an architecture in which intellectual innovation can take place. Behind the scenes, the stacks are skeletal, their shelves like the ribcage that houses and defends the heart. What happens, though, when archival collections move online? What role does authenticity play in the digital realm, and how can curators use technology to preserve and even enhance the magic of the original? If a digital edition facilitates access to otherwise untouchable material, in some way, it actually enhances tangibility. In thinking about the lives of archives in digital editions and in approaching these wireframes, I have also been thinking about stewardship, about the intermingled identities of the figures who interact with and shepherd a collection—the scholar, the editor, the digital humanist, the curator.\n\n\n\nThe wireframes I have created (please pardon the rough work of a first-time wireframer) attempt to invite interaction with the letters from the perspectives of each of the letters’ stewards: the author (Porter herself), the scholar (the advanced Porter researcher), the curator (the librarians and archivists who manage the collection), and the reader (significant elements of Porter’s audience, including secondary school educators and students and non-scholarly admirers of her work). The center of the digital edition is the Letter Viewer:\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"thickbox\" href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Letter-Viewer.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8107\" title=\"Letter Viewer\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Letter-Viewer.jpg\" alt=\"Wireframe for letter viewer\" width=\"410\" height=\"213\" /></a></p>\n\nThe Letter Viewer’s multiple display pane model enables the visitor to view many interpretations of a letter simultaneously by clicking on a word (“Image,” “Transcript,” “Author,” “Scholar,” “Curator,” “Reader”) in the horizontal navigation bar under the letter title and dragging it to a display pane. I envision the Letter Viewer existing in an expansive HTML5-enabled plane like those of the<a href=\"https://republicofletters.stanford.edu/\"> Mapping the Republic of Letters</a> project or the web-based<a href=\"http://prezi.com/your/\"> Prezi</a> software. Side-by-side comparisons of image and transcription are just the beginning of the opportunities afforded by this interface.\n\n\n\nThe Author view presents an interactive timeline display that illuminates information about a letter in the context of Porter’s biography and bibliography:\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"thickbox\" href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Author.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8108\" title=\"Author\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Author.jpg\" alt=\"Wireframe for author view\" width=\"410\" height=\"213\" /></a></p>\n\nThe Scholar view provides visitors with access to annotations, related research, and the downloadable “data” underlying the project:\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"thickbox\" href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Scholar.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8109\" title=\"Scholar\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Scholar.jpg\" alt=\"Wireframe for scholar view\" width=\"410\" height=\"213\" /></a></p>\n\nThe Curator view illuminates the provenance of the Porter letters. Porter served as curator of her own letters in her lifetime and invested great thought into her legacy. Revealing the lives of the letters in the stacks of the Library provides insight into the physicality of the collection and the authenticity of historical objects:\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"thickbox\" href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Curator.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8110\" title=\"Curator\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Curator-980x510.jpg\" alt=\"Wireframe for curator view\" width=\"410\" height=\"213\" /></a></p>\n\nThe Reader view offers opportunities for interactivity and invites the participation of several crucial elements of Porter’s audience:\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"thickbox\" href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Reader.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-8111\" title=\"Reader\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Reader-980x510.jpg\" alt=\"Wireframe for reader view\" width=\"410\" height=\"213\" /></a></p>\n\nAs a whole, these wireframes offer a test case for how a digital project can represent the life and stewardship of an archival collection in a university setting. In other words, this digital edition, itself, is a reflection on the practice of assembling, structuring, and preserving digital editions. Someday soon the project will transform from skeleton to tangible digital physique, and in the capable hands of the Maryland team, I know it will be as radiant and as bright as Porter herself. I am excited (and no doubt Porter would be, too) to imagine these rich letters taking on a new digital life.\n\n\n\n<em>Wendy Hagenmaier is a 2012 Master's Candidate at the School of Information at the University of Texas at Austin.

    "wp post content": "[fusion_text]Over the weekend, Matt Kirschenbaum and I traveled to UNC Chapel Hill in order to meet with the <a href=\"http://www.bitcurator.net/\">BitCurator </a>Development Advisory Group (DAG). By design, our meeting with the DAG coincided with Curate Gear, a <a href=\"http://sils.unc.edu/\">UNC Chapel Hill School of Information and Library Sciences </a>sponsored conference designed to bring together scholars, software developers, and archivists to discuss tools and on-going research focused on the unique challenges of digital curation. Curate Gear was very informative, and showed the need for effective tools to deal with the ever-growing collection of digital artifacts archiving institutions collect daily. Attending the Curate Gear talks and demos emphasized to me just how immediate the problem of digital curation is. It is not, as they say, academic.\n\n\n\nOne of the DAG members, Dr. William Underwood, who also presented at Curate Gear spoke of his work with the George H.W. Bush presidential library and their need to process an extensive collection of existing floppy diskettes. Yes, that's right, we're still trying to work through the first Bush administration's digital records from twenty years ago. This is just one of the many examples at Curate Gear of how pressing this issue is. And not just in academia, the challenge of archiving and making digital records available affects businesses, government agencies, lending libraries and private collections. Think even briefly about the amount of data that now sits unprocessed in shoe boxes in library storage, and you'll immediately see the need for projects such as BitCurator.\n\n\n\nThe next day we walked from the hotel across the UNC campus on a surprisingly warm and sunny morning (at least compared to Maryland) to begin the day-long meeting with the DAG members. What struck me from the beginning was just how engaged and invested the DAG members were. Even as Cal Lee (BitCurator PI and professor at SILS) introduced BitCurator to the group, we began to receive valuable feedback and insights into both the software development process and the particular challenges we might face with the BitCurator project. Professor Geoffrey Brown of Indiana University, for example, offered incisive comments on the importance of maintaining a tight focus on the specific set of problems BitCurator is designed to address. Other DAG members were likewise generous with their comments, which lead to extensive discussions on a range of topics that included:\n\n<ul>\n\n\t<li>The role of BitCurator in a broader ecology of digital archiving tools</li>\n\n\t<li>Properly scoping the project so that it will be able to deliver on the objectives laid out in the design documentation</li>\n\n\t<li>Defining the intended user base for BitCurator</li>\n\n\t<li>GUI and command line interfaces</li>\n\n\t<li>Identifying and sequestering private or otherwise sensitive data during the curation process</li>\n\n\t<li>Education and documentation requirements</li>\n\n\t<li>Outreach and long-term support for the BitCurator project</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nAgain, I was impressed with the interest and engagement in BitCurator, which in my opinion went beyond professional courtesy (though there was that in spades) and demonstrated the very real need for this project. Put another way, BitCurator is a tool that the DAG members want to succeed not simply as a matter of academic curiosity, but because they want to be able to put it to use themselves.\n\n\n\nGoing forward the BitCurator team will revise the design documents based on the DAG members' feedback and then begin the development process. One of the key tasks ahead is building a corpus of \"real world\" archive materials against which we can test BitCurator. As Matt observed at one point, there are any number of DH tools that look and sound promising, yet languish on (the digital equivalent of) dusty shelves because they either don't actually address the intended user's problems or because nobody knows of them. Part of my job, then, will be to make sure that we get more than just good ideas out of the DAG members; we'll need their bits, too.[/fusion_text]",

    "wp post content": "MITH congratulates Tanya Clement (Associate Director, Digital Cultures and Creativity), Dave Lester (Assistant Director, MITH), and Doug Reside (Associate Director, MITH) on the receipt of two new Digital Humanities Start Up Grants in the latest round of competition from the National Endowment for the Humanities' Office of Digital Humanities. Both awards will support events addressing major issues in field, to be hosted at Maryland in the coming year.\n\nTanya Clement and Doug Reside will plan and lead a workshop on Professionalization in Digital Humanities Centers, which will address the rapidly emerging phenomenon of alternative academic careers among the hybrid scholar-programmers now staffing many DH centers. Such staff members are not well accounted for by the normative division between the “research” usually associated with faculty positions and the “service” usually associated with staff. As a result, career trajectories and methods for their professional development are unclear. This Digital Humanities Level 1 Start Up grant will support a MITH-hosted two-day workshop this December and online discussion that will result in a white paper and a set of recommendations for establishing career paths within digital humanities centers.\n\nDave Lester will plan and lead a workshop on the pressing technical challenge of developing APIs (Application Programming Interfaces—technology for allowing different tools and software to interact effectively) for the Digital Humanities. The workshop, to be held this winter, will gather 40-50 digital humanities scholars and developers who are using or interested in using APIs in their digital projects, industry leaders (likely including Google Maps, Freebase, and Open Library) who will demonstrate their APIs, and practitioners who will help guide the group through the \"working weekend.\" Presentations will be video recorded, and recordings made available online through the workshop Web site, which will act as a clearinghouse and publication of all workshop-related content.\n\nNeil Fraistat, Director of MITH, comments, \"With these two grants, MITH continues to address some of the most pressing issues in the field of digital humanities in innovative and substantive ways.”",

    "wp post content": "Tuesday, September 20th kicked-off our Digital Dialogues for the 2011-12 academic year. We had an excellent turnout for our talk given by <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20131208190527/http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~aditi/\" target=\"_blank\">Aditi Muralidharan</a>, doctoral candidate at UC Berkeley, who spoke on the methods and challenges of text-analysis in the digital humanities. Listen to the podcast and follow Aditi's slides <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/dialogues/large-scale-text-analysis-in-the-digital-humanities-methods-and-challenges/\">here</a> if you missed it. As always, the full schedule of upcoming dialogues is viewable on our <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/podcast/\">Digital Dialogues</a> page.\n\nMITH is stretching its legs across the pond...\n\nDirector Neil Fraistat is heading to London to give a lecture entitled \"Digital Humanities Centers and the New Humanities\" at King's College on October 5th. Neil will address the ways and the circumstances under which digital humanities centers might be seen as crucial or deleterious to the field, especially in terms of the <a href=\"http://digitalhumanities.org/centernet/\" target=\"_blank\">centerNet initiative</a>, which seeks to create a truly global network of local digital humanities centers.\n\nGrant Dickie, Web Programmer at MITH, is traveling to Würzburg University on October 7th for <a href=\"http://www.interedition.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">InterEdition</a>’s Development Bootcamp. Interedition is raising awareness of the significance of interoperability as a major driver for sustainability for tools and data in the field of digital scholarship. Grant attends as a Domain Expert on behalf of his work for the <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/tile/\" target=\"_blank\">Text-Image Linking Environment </a>(TILE). During the bootcamp, stay tuned to the MITH blog, as Grant will be live-blogging on his work refactoring ideas for TILE. Following InterEdition, Grant will attend the coinciding TEI-Workshop “An Introduction to TextGridLab” also held at Würzburg University, October 12-14th, in order to attend a tutorial on <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20120204225545/http://www.textgrid.de/en.html\" target=\"_blank\">TextGrid</a>.\n\nWe’re keeping things interesting back on the home front...\n\nMITH is pleased to welcome two new Research Associates to our staff as part of the work on the <a href=\"http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Shelley-Godwin Archive</a>. David Brookshire, Lecturer and Research Associate in the Department of English at the University of Maryland, is serving as Manuscripts Transcription Editor. David is the editor, and a contributor, for Percy Shelley and the De-limitation of the Gothic, a forthcoming volume of essays in the Romantic Circles Praxis Series. Joining David is senior undergraduate in English at Maryland, Wenfei Zhou, who is assisting in transcribing the history contained within Shelley’s manuscripts.\n\nAs part of our role in <a href=\"http://www.projectbamboo.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Project Bamboo</a>, MITH hosted a workshop on September 15-16th for project members to discuss the next stage of planning for Phase II. In this workshop, partners took significant steps toward solidifying Phase II goals, mapping out a work plan, and preparing the proposal that will be submitted to The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Phase II is concentrated on two things: first, building a focused infrastructure for the exploration and curation of digital texts in the <a href=\"http://www.hathitrust-research.org/\" target=\"_blank\">HathiTrust Research Center</a>, <a href=\"http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/\" target=\"_blank\">Perseus Digital Library</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.lib.umich.edu/tcp/\" target=\"_blank\">Text Creation Partnership</a> repositories, and second, reaching a wider audience, ranging from the professional humanist to the citizen scholar.\n\nBe sure to return to our blog throughout the Fall, as our three resident faculty fellows will be blogging about their on-going work as they commence their new digital projects. You’ll learn the challenges that Dr. Hayim Lapin encounters as he creates a digital edition of the Mishnah; Dr. Peter Mallios’ understanding of the significance of foreign authored literature in the United States; and Dr. Carla Peterson’s research behind the social and cultural history of New York City’s black elite from about 1810 to 1895.",

U.Va.'s committment to the project includes the definition of metadata standards, the creation of search and discovery interfaces, and the development and implementation of multiple Hydra \"heads\" such as the interface and workflow in use for the U.Va. institutional repository. This talk will provide a brief overview of the Hydra Project and the tools under development, describe some of the processes and challenges for development teams working within a library setting, discuss the value of having a Digital Humanities R&amp;D group (the Scholars' Lab) embedded in this same setting, and the types of \"alt-ac\" positions, roles, and responsibilities that can be found in this environment.\n\nJULIE MELONI is the Chief Architect of the Online Library Environent at the University of Virginia Library. Engaged in the design and development of web-based application since 1994, the bulk of her work occured in the private sector, where her responsibilities ranged from enterprise-grade application planning, design, and development, to system administration and user interface and user experience consultation. Since 2000, she has authored more than fifteen editions of texts for Sams Publishing, covering numerous topics in web application development, applications, and programming languages. She also completed a PhD in English from Washington State University in 2010, with an emphasis on nineteenth-century American Literature and History of the Book.\n\nA continuously updated schedule of talks is also available on the <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/podcast/\">Digital Dialogues webpage</a>.\n\nUnable to attend the events in person?

    "wp post content": "As a professor in the humanities, I've spent a career committed to scholarly research. But I confess to having definite likes and dislikes.\n\n\n\nHere's what I like: going to the archives and rooting around looking at old documents, admiring early print fonts and deciphering barely legible handwriting; finding little scraps of paper with gold mines of information on them; creating stories out of these scraps and publishing them in essay or book form; talking about them to anybody and everybody willing to listen.\n\n\n\nHere's what I don't like: sitting in front of my computer trying to engage with new media. I admit to being technologically challenged. I can word process (do people still use that term?) and email, and I love wasting time googling this, that, and the other. But that's about it. I don't do facebook (I think you're supposed to do something with a wall), I don't twitter or tweet (in fact I'm not sure what the distinction between the two is). I do own a cell phone but the only function that works is making outgoing calls; it's definitely not for tm (is that short for text messaging?).\n\n\n\n<a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/confessions/black-gotham-archive/\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-4308\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-12828 \" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/black-gotham-archive.jpg\" alt=\"Black Gotham Book\" width=\"214\" height=\"317\" /></a>So you might well wonder why I went online a few nights ago and, with massive spousal support and encouragement, purchased a domain name: <a href=\"http://www.blackgothamarchive.org/\" target=\"_blank\">www.blackgothamarchive.org</a>.\n\n\n\nEarlier this spring Yale University Press published my book<em>,</em> <a href=\"http://yalepress.yale.edu/book.asp?isbn=9780300162554\" target=\"_blank\">Black Gotham:</a><em><a href=\"http://yalepress.yale.edu/book.asp?isbn=9780300162554\" target=\"_blank\"> A Family History of African Americans in Nineteenth-Century New York City</a></em>. It was eleven years in the making, and I suspect it took that long because of my addiction to archival research and playing with narrative form.\n\n\n\nAn early paragraph in the book explains my general goal:\n\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>\"We still hold certain truths about African Americans to be self-evident: that \"New York State before the Civil War\" denotes a place of freedom; that \"blacks in New York City\" designates Harlem; that the \"black community\" posits a classless and culturally unified society; that a \"black elite\" did not exist until well into the twentieth century. The lives of my forbears belie such assumptions. They were born free at a time when slavery was still legal in New York State. They lived in racially mixed neighborhoods, first in Lower Manhattan and then after the Civil War in Brooklyn, at a time when Harlem was a mere village. They were part of New York's small but significant black community, and specifically its elite class.\"</em></p>\n\nTo make my argument, I structured my book around two concepts. The first is generational history, in which I focus on the lives of my great-great-grandfather—Peter Guignon—his son-in-law and my great-grandfather—Philip Augustus White—their families, and friends as entry points into a broader social and cultural history of New York City's black elite from about 1805 to 1895. The second is social geography in which I illustrate how members of this elite inhabited a series of concentric circles, each broader than the last, that gave meaning and shape to their lives: 1) their elite social circle; 2) the larger black community; 3) city neighborhoods and the city itself; 4) locations beyond the city (ties with blacks in Boston, Philadelphia, etc.); 5) and the world itself (since they originated from all parts of the globe). I argue that in contrast to the all too familiar Harlem model, nineteenth-century black New Yorkers lived throughout the entire city, in different wards and neighborhoods, and came into contact with a wide range of the city's white inhabitants through a variety of contacts, some predictable, some not.\n\n\n\nThis past spring I gave many talks to both general and academic audiences about Black Gotham and, after a summer hiatus, have started my book tour again which will continue until March 2012. My audiences have been especially fascinated by two aspects of my work: my exposition of New York's black history before Harlem, and my use of family to tell a larger history. Many people tell me that they have stories of their own they want told, but they're daunted by the task of doing years of research, writing a manuscript, finding a publisher, and then attracting readers. I've reluctantly come to see the limitations of the printed essay and book. So one of my goals with the \"Black Gotham Digital Archive\" is to provide a platform on which those with New York family histories can add their own stories. Out of readers I hope to create writers. I'm hoping that the result will be an even more detailed portrait of black New Yorkers in the nineteenth century than my book provides.\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">________________</p>\n\n<em>Editor's Note</em>: Carla L.

(All of these are available under the Work In Progress section.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNora is a multi-institutional, multi-disciplinary Mellon-funded project to apply text mining and visualization techniques to large humanities-oriented digital library collections (starting with a 10,000-text corpus of 18th and 19th century British and American literature). MITH, in collaboration with <a href=\"http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil\">HCIL</a>, is one of several institutional partners in the grant. Matthew Kirschenbaum, MITH's Acting Associate Director, serves at the Maryland PI. Martha Nell Smith, MITH's founding Director, is co-PI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMatthew Kirschenbaum also recently participated on behalf of nora in The Valve''s recent book event for Franco Moretti's <a href=\"http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/archive_asc/C48\"><em>Graphs, Maps, Trees</em></a>.

    "wp post content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I can’t begin to say how grateful I am for the privilege of having served as Director of MITH for the past twelve years. If there is a more inspiring job anywhere, I’m not aware of it. I count myself especially fortunate to have held this position </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">during the intellectual ferment marking the emergence of the Digital Humanities as a vibrant field, and I believe that MITH has contributed valuably toward this end.</span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More than most fields in the humanities, DH is collaborative, and I have gained so much in </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">knowledge and by way of friendships during these twelve years of working with the widespread community of scholars, students, and staff, both on campus and beyond, who have engaged with MITH projects, programs, fellowships, training, and courses. </span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My gratitude extends to the able administrators and their staffs who have provided staunch support for MITH, especially Deans of the College of Arts and Humanities, Jim Harris and Bonnie Thornton Dill; Deans of the Libraries, Charles Lowry, Pat Steele, and Babak Hamidzadeh; and former longtime Dean of the iSchool, Jenny Preece. Without doing a long roll call, I’d also like to thank the superb program officers of the NEH, IMLS, and Mellon Foundation, without whose support the Digital Humanities never could have flourished. They often asked telling questions that led good projects to be re-conceptualized into excellent ones. </span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those who know me well probably expect a quotation from Percy Bysshe Shelley somewhere in this farewell. But I’m turning instead to the inimitable Casey Stengel, one-time manager of both the New York Yankees and the New York Mets, who has said, “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Managing is getting paid for home runs that someone else hits.” I’m proud of all the home runs MITH’s extraordinarily talented staff has hit during my tenure, and I cherish the long-lasting friendships I’ve made here over the years. To MITH’s current staff--Trevor, Grace, Purdom, Stephanie, Kirsten, Raff, and Ed—I want to say what a great pleasure it has been working with you: I’ve enjoyed every single day at the office and will miss your constant company. </span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My deepest debt is to my brilliant colleague and friend Matt Kirschenbaum, who has been with me for the whole journey. He began as MITH’s Associate Director on the same day as I began as Director, and he acted in that capacity until recently becoming the founding Director of our Graduate Certificate Program in Digital Studies in the Arts and Humanities. Much of MITH’s success can be attributed to Matt’s vision, acuity, and intellectual breadth. Carl Stahmer, who joined Matt and me as an Associate Director during our first year, and Doug Reside who followed Carl, were instrumental in getting us off to a fast and sure-footed start, along with designer par excellence Greg Lord.</span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ah! But Shelley is never far behind, whether or not I quote him. As I cycle off of MITH on July 1 and return to the English Department, I will begin an extended research leave dedicated to his works and those of Mary Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft, and William Godwin—a thrilling prospect! In saying farewell, I know that I couldn’t possibly leave MITH in better hands than those of the remarkable Trevor Muñoz, who I know will lead MITH steadily along an ever-ascending trajectory.</span>",

    "wp post content": "<a href=\"http://songscapes.org\">Early Modern Songscapes</a> is a project exploring the circulation and performance of English Renaissance poetry. The recently released beta version of the project’s site includes a digital exploration of Henry Lawes’s 1653 songbook <i>Ayres and Dialogues</i>. The project is a collaboration between the University of Toronto (UoT), the University of Maryland (UMD), and the University of South Carolina (USC). My role (Raff Viglianti) at MITH for this first exploratory phase has focused on designing a data model and an online viewer for the text and musical score of the songs. Prof. Scott Trudell (UMD) and Prof. Sarah Williams (USC) have contributed to shaping the data model and have carried out the encoding work so far.\n\n\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_20512\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"309\"]<img class=\"wp-image-20512 \" src=\"https://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/songscapes_encoding_diagram.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"309\" height=\"430\" /> Fig. 1 Schematic representation of the encoding data model for a song, with TEI including MEI data. The song shown is <i><a href=\"http://ems.digitalscholarship.utsc.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/ems%3A113\">When on the Altar of my hand</a></i>. Facsimile from Early English Books Online.[/caption]\n\n\n\nThe scholarship surrounding Lawes’s book and Early Modern song is at the nexus of literature and music and pays careful attention to both the literary and musical aspects of the songs. To reflect this duality in the data model of a digital edition, we use the <a href=\"http://www.tei-c.org/\">Text Encoding Initiative</a> (TEI) format for the verse and the <a href=\"http://music-encoding.org/\">Music Encoding Initiative</a> (MEI) format for the notated music. You can find our encoded files on <a href=\"https://github.com/earlymodernsongscapes/songscapes\">GitHub</a>. Combining the two formats is becoming a fairly established practice (see for example the <a href=\"http://www.chmtl.indiana.edu/tml/about/introduction\">Thesaurus Musicarum Latinarum</a>), but is not without challenges as existing tools and workflows are usually focused on either TEI or MEI. The hierarchical nature of these formats also requires one of the two to contain the other or, in other words, take a primary position. We have decide to prioritize TEI, partly because it has a well established metadata header in which we store bibliographical information. The MEI representing the music notation is then embedded within the TEI (see Fig. 1). We have decided to reproduce the underlying lyrics as a TEI-encoded stanza in order to provide our interpretation of how it may appear if formatted as subsequent stanzas often printed after the music.\n\n\n\nFor some songs, we are also dealing with multiple versions from other sources with or without music. In these cases, we produce a <i>variorum edition</i>, or a presentation of the text that showcases differences across the sources without privileging one over the other. Both TEI and MEI are well equipped formats for modeling textual variance, but both assume that one text will be the main reading text and only variant text will be encoded from other sources. To overcome this apparent limitation, we create a separate TEI/MEI document that only represents a collation; in other words, a document that lists where the differences between the sources of one song are to be located. This allows us to encode each source separately and to the degree of detail that we deem appropriate without worrying about tessellating multiple sources in one place (see Fig. 2). This approach has proven quite effective and I have had the opportunity to apply it to other projects at MITH and beyond, such as <a href=\"https://mith.umd.edu/research/digital-mishnah/\">Digital Mishnah</a> and the <a href=\"https://pghfrankenstein.github.io/Pittsburgh_Frankenstein/\">Frankenstein Variorum</a> edition where, together with colleagues at Pittsburgh University and CMU, particularly Prof. Elisa Beshero-Bondar, we have begun to further develop, contextualize, and generalize this approach.\n\n\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_20513\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<img class=\"wp-image-20513 size-medium\" src=\"https://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Songscapes_Collation-300x280.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"280\" /> Fig. 2 Diagram of the data model of an hypothetical song with variants, showing three sources (A, B, and C) and a collation containing two variants that identify and connect diverging parts of the sources.[/caption]\n\n\n\nOne goal of the Early Modern Songscapes project is to capture song as a multidimensional form, so we are complementing the edition with recorded performances of the songs, including variant version, under the direction of Prof. Katherine Larson (UoT). The musicians are Rebecca Claborn (mezzo-soprano), Lawrence Wiliford (tenor), and Lucas Harris (lute).\n\n\n\nThe UoT Scarborough Digital Scholarship Unit, under the direction of Marcus Barnes, has provided the backbone for the project through a robust implementation of <a href=\"https://duraspace.org/fedora/\">Fedora</a> for storing the Songscapes data and <a href=\"https://islandora.ca/\">Islandora</a> for the project website. My focus has been on providing a lightweight viewer for displaying the TEI, MEI, and adding interactivity for exploring variant readings and sources. The viewer is written in React/Redux and uses <a href=\"https://github.com/TEIC/CETEIcean\">CETEIcean</a> for rendering the TEI and <a href=\"http://verovio.org/\">Verovio</a> for rendering MEI. Both of these tools offer a solution for rendering these data directly in a user’s browser, thus reducing the need for server-side infrastructure for TEI and MEI publications. They also provide isomorphic (that is one-to-one) renderings of the data, which allows to manipulate the rendering as if it were the actual underlying data. This, for example, makes it somewhat simple to write code to follow references from collation documents to the sources according to the <i>variorum edition</i> model described above. You can read more on CETEIcean in <a href=\"https://www.balisage.net/Proceedings/vol21/html/Cayless01/BalisageVol21-Cayless01.html\">Cayless &amp; Viglianti 2018</a> and on Verovio in <a href=\"https://github.com/Edirom/Festschrift-Veit/releases/download/v1.1/Festschrift-Veit_1.1.pdf\">Pugin 2106</a> (pages 617-631).\n\n\n\nThe first phase of Early Modern Songscapes has culminated with <a href=\"https://crrs.ca/event/early-modern-songscapes-2019/\">a conference</a> at the University of Toronto, February 8-9 2019. As we plan the next phase, we are gathering user feedback on the site: we invite you to visit <a href=\"http://songscapes.org\">songscapes.org</a> and fill in our <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/songscapes\">survey</a>!\n\n\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_20514\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"713\"]<img class=\"wp-image-20514 \" src=\"https://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/songscapes_variant-980x345.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"713\" height=\"251\" /> Fig. 3 A screenshot of the current prototype showing a variant for the song <i><a href=\"http://ems.digitalscholarship.utsc.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/ems%3A112\">Venus, redress a wrong that's done (A Complaint Against Cupid)</a></i>.[/caption]",

Velazquez's examines three areas, the Go Mamasita! Dance Studio, a site envisioned as a place where women of color, particularly African- American women, can reconnect with dance ancestry, a nexus to North African dance traditions, filtered through the lens of digital diaspora; <em>Red Light Center (RLC)</em>, an adults-only virtual world, similar in design to <em>World of Warcraft </em>or <em>SecondLife, </em>to discuss the role pre-structuring technology takes in creating erotic virtual cityscapes; and the blogosphere, particularly blogs that grapple with anti-racist discourse, fandom, and popular culture. Through an investigation of these spaces, Velazquez describes the ways individuals engage in virtual and “real-world” activism. Actions and behaviors that highlight the ways in which the language of friendship, holism, and community is mobilized in conversations about citizenship, the body, and desire. While a dance studio, a pornographic virtual world, and segments of the blogosphere may seem like a disparate collection of sites for investigation, all three share an abiding interest in the body and its potential as site of pleasure.\n\nMARIA VELAZQUEZ is a doctoral student at the University of Maryland (College Park, Md.) in American Studies, and MITH Winnemore Dissertation Fellow. Her research interests include constructions of race, class, gender, and sexuality in contemporary media, as well as community building and technology. She serves on the board of Lifting Voices, a District of Columbia-based nonprofit that helps young people in DC discover the power of creative writing. She blogs for The Hathor Legacy (<a href=\"http://www.thehathorlegacy.com/\">www.thehathorlegacy.com</a>), a feminist pop culture blog, and recently received the Winnemore Dissertation Fellowship from the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH). She has also received a fellowship from the Consortium on Race, Gender, and Ethnicity’s Interdisciplinary Scholars Program. Her dissertation project examines the use of the body as a component in community building, paying particular attention to the Bellydancers of Color Association, the anti-racist blogosphere, and Red Light Center, an adults’ only virtual world. Maria is also a Ron Brown Scholar and an alumna of Smith College.\n\nA continuously updated schedule of talks is also available on the <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/podcast/\"><strong>Digital Dialogues webpage</strong></a>.\n\nUnable to attend the events in person?

We thought that some of the details of how we went about doing this work could be interesting to share with a wider audience, and also wanted to begin a short series of posts that showcases the work that some students generated during the class.\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://dsah.umd.edu/requirements/#introds\">MITH 610</a> introduces students to current topics and critical issues in the field of Digital Studies. MITH itself functions not just as a space for the class, but also as a laboratory for experimenting with digital methods, and getting acquainted with people on campus (and in the DC area) who are doing work in the digital humanities.\n\n\n\nFor example this past Spring MITH 610 was broken up into 3 modules: Reimagining the Archive, Media Archaeology and Data Stories. In the Data Stories module we worked with students to understand how social media APIs operate, and explored how to do data collection and documentation while being guided by the principles of <a href=\"https://mith.umd.edu/advocacy-design-moving-theory-practice-part-1/\">Advocacy by Design</a>. Advocacy by Design centers ethical questions of <em>why</em> we are interested in pursuing particular sets of research questions in order to better understand <em>how</em> we carry out the research, interpret our findings, and speculate about possible futures that they entail. These conversations compel us to ask how people are represented in, or are subjects of, academic work. Who reads and uses our work? Who collaborates and contributes to our work? Providing a welcoming and collaborative space for asking these questions is a central part of MITH's vision for digital studies at UMD, which you can also see reflected in its core <a href=\"https://mith.umd.edu/about/values/\">values</a>.\n\n\n\nOne somewhat mundane, but never the less significant, challenge we often face when working as a group with different technologies is what we call <em>The Laptop Problem</em>. Fortunately, students come to class with a computer of some kind. It's almost a given, especially in a field like digital studies. On the plus side this means that students arrive to class already equipped with the tools of the trade, and we don't need to manage an actual set of machines for them to use. However on the down side everyone comes with a slightly different machine and/or operating system which can make it very difficult for us to craft a single set of comprehensive instructions for. Much time can be lost time simply getting everyone set up to begin the actual work.\n\n\n\nWe were also stymied by another problem. In introducing social media data collection we wanted to go where the Digital Humanities generally (and wisely) fears to tread: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface\">The Command Line</a>. In the previous Media Archaeology module, students examined and experimented with MITH's <a href=\"https://mith.umd.edu/vintage-computers/\">Vintage Computing</a> collection, which involved working directly with older hardware and software interfaces, and reflecting on the affordances that they offer. If you are curious about what this involved here's a short Twitter thread by Caitlin Christian-Lamb that describes (with some great pictures) some of her work in this module:\n\n\n\nhttps://twitter.com/christianlamb/status/988913065147105280\n\n\n\nWe thought it would be compelling to introduce social media data collection by using the command line interface, as an example of a (relatively) ancient computer interface that continues to be heavily used even today, particularly in Cloud environments. But because of <em>The Laptop Problem</em> we weren't guaranteed everyone would have the same command line available to them, or that they would even have access to it. One way of solving <em>The Laptop Problem</em> is to provide access to a shared virtual environment of some kind where software is already installed. This is when we ran across <a href=\"https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudshell\">Google Cloud Shell</a>.\n\n\n\nSince the University of Maryland uses Google's <a href=\"https://edu.google.com/\">GSuite for Education</a> for email and other services, students are (for better or worse) guaranteed to have (at least one) Google account. As part of Google Cloud they offer any account holder the ability to go to a URL <a href=\"https://console.cloud.google.com/\">https://console.cloud.google.com/</a>cloudshell which automatically launches a virtual machine in the cloud, and give you a terminal window directly in your browser for interacting with it. It is a real Debian Linux operating system, which can used without having to install any software at all.\n\n\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-19823 size-large\" src=\"https://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-30-at-3.06.04-PM-980x918.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"980\" height=\"918\" />\n\n\n\nWe developed a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11QSMTAiGWEJM324Tpm_SNYImVxAhkeGQfg_UaV0bgsI/edit#\">short exercise</a> that walked students through how to launch Google Cloud Shell, get comfortable with a few commands, install the <a href=\"https://github.com/docnow/twarc\">twarc</a> utility, and use it to collect some Twitter data directly from Twitter's API. twarc has been developed as part of MITH's involvement in the <a href=\"https://www.docnow.io/\">Documenting the Now</a> project, and allowed  students to collect Twitter data matching a query of their choosing, store it in the native JSON format that Twitter themselves make available, and download it for further analysis.\n\n\n\nDescribing all the intricate details of this data flow was well beyond the scope of the class. But it did present an opportunity for demystifying how Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) take their shape on the web, and to describe how these services make structured data available, and to who. Matt likes to refer to refer to this experience as Little Big Data. To bookend the exercise students wrote about what they chose to collect and why, and reflected on what the collected data, and the experience of collecting it said to them in the shape of a short data story. Look for a few of these stories in subsequent posts here on the MITH blog.",

    "wp post content": "Roughly one year ago members of the <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/bitcurator-team-convenes-to-analyze-digital-forensics-in-archival-workflows/\">BitCurator Professional Experts Panel (PEP) met at the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH</a>) to help further refine the scope and priorities of the BitCurator project, and ensure that our efforts would have \"real world\" usefulness for archivists and librarians who are responsible for born-digital materials. The PEP meeting, along with a similar meeting in January of the Development Advisory Group, produced two significant results: first, revisions to a <a href=\"http://wiki.bitcurator.net/index.php?title=Requirements_Documentation\">product requirements document</a> that outlined the work to be done on the BitCurator project, including an architecture overview and feature descriptions; and second, a collection of detailed workflows that have helped us to identify where BitCurator can best fit into and enhance curatorial practices. The upcoming one-year anniversary of these initial meetings makes this a good time to take a look at how the BitCurator project has progressed and where we're headed in the near future.\n\nThe BitCurator development team is making available at test release of the BitCurator Environment, which can now be downloaded from the <a href=\"http://wiki.bitcurator.net/\">BitCurator wiki</a>. The BitCurator Environment is a fully functioning Linux system built on Ubuntu 12.04 that has been customized to meet the needs of archivists and librarians, and it can be run either as a stand-alone operating system or as a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine#VM_definitions\">virtual machine</a>. Once installed, the BitCurator Environment includes a number of digital forensics tools that can be integrated into digital curation workflows. A sampling of those tools includes:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Guymager: a tool for creating disk images in one of three commonly used disk image formats (dd, E01, and AFF).</li>\n\t<li>custom Nautilus scripts: A collection of enhancements to Ubuntu’s default file browser that allow users to quickly generate checksums, identify file types, safely mount drives, and more.</li>\n\t<li>bulk_extractor: a tool that locates personal identifiable information (PII) and then generates reports on that information in both human and machine readable formats.</li>\n\t<li>Ghex: an open source hex editor that allows users to view a file in hexadecimal format.</li>\n</ul>\nThe BitCurator environment will make additional available tools available in later releases.\n\nThe BitCurator team has also been developing various forms of documentation to complement the product development. On the BitCurator wiki you can find documentation that introduces virtual machines, instructs users on how to install the BitCurator environment, and gives detailed configuration instructions on sharing devices and files between host and virtual machines. We are also currently working on developing documentation that outlines use-case scenarios for digital archivists using the tools mentioned above.\n\nIt is not enough, of course, to simply build tools and a wiki page and hope users will come find our software. The BitCurator team has also been actively promoting the BitCurator Environment through lectures, panel discussions, conference talks, posters, and publications. Recent examples include presentations from Kam Woods (BitCurator technical lead), Cal Lee and Matthew Kirschenbaum (BitCurator Co-PIs) on BitCurator and digital forensics at this year’s <a href=\"http://www2.archivists.org/\">Society of American Archivists</a> conference in San Diego; and presentations by Cal at Archiving 2012 in Copenhagen, Denmark, Memory of the World in the Digital Age in Vancouver, Canada, the International Congress on Archives in Brisbane, Australia, and to the staff of the National Library of Australia in Canberra. In addition, team members Alex Chassanoff and Porter Olsen will present a poster on integrating digital forensics into born-digital workflows at the upcoming <a href=\"http://www.asis.org/\">ASIS&amp;T conference</a>. We have also recently published an article in D-Lib Magazine titled “<a href=\"http://www.dlib.org/dlib/may12/lee/05lee.html\">BitCurator: Tools and Techniques for Digital Forensics in Collecting Institutions</a>.”\n\nWe have also been incorporating BitCurator elements into professional education offerings.  Cal has developed a one-day continuing education course called “Digital Forensics for Archivists” as part of the Digital Archives Specialist (DAS) curriculum of the Society of American Archivists (SAA).  Matt Kirschenbaum and Naomi Nelson (BitCurator PEP member) have been offering a course called “Born-Digital Materials: Theory &amp; Practice” as part of the Rare Book School (RBS) at the University of Virginia.  Both the SAA and RBS courses serve as excellent mechanisms for raising awareness about BitCurator’s offerings and eliciting needs and perceptions from working professionals.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the work done by the BitCurator team to get the word out about BitCurator and our work on bringing digital forensics tools and techniques the digital curation community. For a full list of BitCurator related publications and presentations, please visit our project website at <a href=\"http://www.bitcurator.net./\">www.bitcurator.net.</a>\n\nAs we look forward into the next few months, the BitCurator team has a number of goals and benchmarks that we will be working towards, chief among them being the release of the BitCurator beta later this fall. We are also organizing the second annual meeting of our Development Advisory Group for January 2013, where we will elicit feedback from DAG members on our releases to date. The day before the DAG meeting will be <a href=\"http://ils.unc.edu/digccurr/curategear2013.html\">CurateGear 2013</a> on January 9 in Chapel Hill, where members of the DAG and many other experts will give presentations and run demos of software to support digital curation  And finally, we are currently in the process of applying for funding for phase two of the BitCurator project to support additional product development and further efforts to engage with working professionals who could benefit from implementation of the BitCurator tools. We invite those who are interested, especially those in collecting institutions working with born-digital materials, to follow our progress at www.bitcurator.net, or follow us on Twitter at @bitcurator. For those who would like to jump right in and start working with the BitCurator Environment, you can do so at <a href=\"http://wiki.bitcurator.net/index.php?title=Main_Page\">wiki.bitcurator.net</a> and join the <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bitcurator-users\">BitCurator Users List</a>.\n\nIf you have questions about the BitCurator project or the role of digital forensics methods in born-digital curation, please feel free to ask them in the comments section below.\n\n<em>Porter Olsen is a Ph.D. candidate in the University of Maryland Department of English and a Graduate Research Assistant at MITH.</em>",

Over the course of the week, readers submitted their questions to Dr. Peterson about nineteenth-century black New York. She has taken the time to respond to questions. One of her responses appears here. Visit the <a href=\"http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/15/answers-about-black-history-in-19th-century-new-york-part-1/\">\"Taking Questions\"</a> page to read more.\n\nQ. <em>The article mentions black doctors and pharmacists in New York in the 1800s. Where did they receive their educations? Were there any schools open to them or did they simply work in hospitals and watch what others were doing?</em>—Ed Schwab, Alexandria, VA\n\nA. In the 1790s the New York Manumission Society established several schools for black children. Its members maintained that education was a necessary component of freedom (despite the fact that several of them were themselves slave owners). These schools were known as African Free Schools, the most famous of which was African Free School No. 2 located on Mulberry Street. This was the school that my great-great-grandfather attended along with several boys who later became prominent leaders of the city's black community and also worked nationally with men like Frederick Douglass. Until the 1830s, when the city took over their management, these schools offered as good an education as that of other charity schools of the time, probably even better.\n\nThroughout this period, however, New York's black leaders refused to stay on the sidelines when it came to educating their young. Since poor school attendance was a real problem (how can you send your kids to school in the winter when they have no shoes or overcoats?), black leaders visited homes to see how they could help out. They also established an educational society that set up its own schools, but few of them lasted due to lack of funds.\n\nGetting a higher education was equally difficult. James McCune Smith was denied entrance to U.S. medical schools, so he went to the University of Glasgow medical school (graduating first in his class!). My great-grandfather Philip Augustus White attended the College of Pharmacy of the City of New York, graduating in 1844, even though professional certification in pharmacy was not required at the time. In the 1850s, Peter Williams Ray gained admission to an American medical school, Castleton medical college in Vermont. But when he tried to become a member of the Kings County Medical Society, he was rejected, the argument being that \"by science that this was a white man's Society. … Therefore a colored man could not be admitted.\" Yet these black men surmounted the odds and went on to establish successful pharmacy and medical practices.\n\n<em>Please note this question and answer originally appeared at <a href=\"http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/15/answers-about-black-history-in-19th-century-new-york-part-1/\" target=\"_blank\">The New York Times City Room blog series, \"Taking Questions\"</a> on February 15, 2012.</em>",

Traditionally, humanities libraries have been defined by their emphasis on rare materials or special collections. What are the implications of having an abundant humanities library?\n\nAs a greater amount of these materials becomes available in digital format, there is growing evidence that humanists might adopt data-driven research or teaching methods that are typically common in the sciences. The multi-institutional &quot;Digging into Data&quot; request for proposals represents an example of this new frontier. The Roman de la Rose Digital Library led by the Johns Hopkins University represents a useful case study in this realm. Choudhury will discuss the implications of the Rose Digital Library for digital librarians and scholars and offer ideas about how humanists might consider developing and leveraging cyberinfrastructure across domains.\n\nSAYEED CHOUDHURY is the Associate Dean for Library Digital Programs and Hodson Director of the Digital Research and Curation Center at the Sheridan Libraries of Johns Hopkins University. He is also the Director of Operations for the Institute of Data Intensive Engineering and Science (IDIES) based at Johns Hopkins.

    "wp post content": "A MITH Digital Dialogue\nTuesday, November 17, 12:30 -- 1:45\nMITH Conference Room, McKeldin Library B0135\n\n&quot;Archiving America: The Vitaphone, the DVD, and Warner Bros. (re)store Jazz History&quot; by JENNIFER FLEEGER\n\nIn 2007 Warner Bros. released the 80th anniversary DVD edition of The Jazz Singer, a boxed set that includes 34 conversion-era sound shorts and a 90-minute documentary about the Vitaphone and the birth of sound cinema. This collection is a tempered version of Warner&apos;s prior histories of the conversion that situate the studio squarely at the lead in what its executives unflinchingly labeled a &quot;revolution&quot; of the motion picture industry. While Warner Bros. explicitly appeals for a revision of its former hubris, the jazz shorts included in this volume not only support the studio&apos;s prior nomination of Al Jolson as the leader of American jazz, they characterize American music history as a hodgepodge of white performances lacking a dominant trend and calling for a star. In this collection as in many of its other DVD releases, Warner Bros. recreates the film experience by including contemporary shorts that might plausibly (and in some cases would certainly) have been screened alongside the feature for which the disc was conceived. An attempt at historical accuracy, this practice instead constructs a spectator capable only of browsing the past for clues to what both he and the studio already know to be true. This presentation considers the practice of archiving American jazz for both the period of conversion and the present reconstruction of the era and argues that the potential for innovation enabled by digital remastering is complicated by Warner&apos;s continued efforts to shape the reception of its historiography.\n\nJennifer Fleeger received her Ph.D. from the Department of Cinema and Comparative Literature at the University of Iowa in 2009. Her dissertation, &quot;Opera, Jazz, and Hollywood&apos;s Conversion to Sound,&quot; concentrates largely on sound shorts released between 1926 and1932 and analyzes competing film sound technologies with respect to the genres of music employed to catalogue cultural experience. She has published articles in Music, Sound and the Moving Image and an anthology on media marketing and her piece on Al Jolson and the Vitaphone is scheduled to appear this fall in The Quarterly Review of Film and Video.\n\nAll talks are free and open to the public!\n\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-8927)",

Everywhere one looks these days, computer scientists are bringing text analysis to humanities scholars with tutorials, workshops, and toolkits. Nevertheless, crucial information is being lost in translation. If text analysis toolkits are to be truly successful, information needs to start flowing the other way and computer scientists must learn from humanities scholars what humanistic text analysis really means. If not, they will continue making \"natural\" assumptions that do not always translate into the humanities such as, for example, that concepts like \"question\", \"hypothesis\", \"data\", \"evidence\" are always well-defined in scholars' minds, and universal to all analysis. In in the extreme case, this misalignment of basic assumptions could lead to fleets of powerful text analysis tools that nobody knows how to actually apply to humanistic analysis.\n\n\n\nIn this talk, Aditi Muralidharan, Computer Science Ph.D. Candidate at UC Berkeley, will describe her experiences collaborating with English scholars to build the NEH-funded WordSeer text analysis toolkit, and discuss differences between the ways that computer scientists and humanities scholars view text analysis, and ways in which communication between the two fields can be improved.\n\nThis talk will be held in the MITH Seminar Room, in the basement of McKeldin Library.\n\n\n\n<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20131208190527/http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~aditi/\" target=\"_blank\">Aditi Muralidharan</a> is a Ph.D. candidate within the Department of Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley. She builds and researches systems for large-scale text analysis.

    "wp post content": "<em>This post is part 2 in a <a href=\"https://mith.umd.edu/little-big-data/\">series</a> about social media data collection experiments conducted in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mkirschenbaum\">Matt Kirschenbaum</a>‘s <a href=\"https://dsah.umd.edu/requirements/#introds\">Introduction to Digital Studies</a>.</em>\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\nFred Turner’s interview with Logic Magazine<sup><a href=\"#note1\"><sup>1</sup></a></sup> was one of the first readings for MITH 610: Critical Topics in Digital Studies, the introductory course to digital humanities at the University of Maryland. Over the course of the semester, we were asked to complete several exercises that incorporated digital methodologies, and I decided to return to Turner’s reading for our mini data story exercise. For this exercise, we were asked to gather a Twitter data set using <a href=\"https://github.com/docnow/twarc\">twarc</a> and to develop a data story with the data we collected.\n\n\n\nMy central questions were: Is engineering culture “about making the product” as Fred Turner asserts? Is it about more, or less, or something altogether different? These questions motivated me to collect <a href=\"https://github.com/msyang7/datastory/blob/master/data/engtweets.csv\">CSV data</a> filled with tweets that included “#engineering.” I am interested in how society constructs the image of engineering and how this image might influence students’ relationships to engineering, including decisions to pursue engineering as a major and interactions with the curriculum once they begin engineering coursework. My working assumption is that we each have an image of “the engineer,” an image that functions much like Alasdair MacIntyre’s “character.” MacIntyre defines character as “a very special type of social role which places a certain kind of moral constraint on the personality of those who inhabit them in a way in which many other social roles do not.”<sup><a href=\"#note2\">2</a></sup> If #engineering is what an engineer does, then my concern is how the image of that doing constrains.\n\n\n\nWhile hashtags can be used to follow social justice movements, for example to “reveal a feminist activist assemblage,”<sup><a href=\"#note3\">3</a></sup> I want to see if “#engineering” might reveal an assemblage from which I can derive adjectives to describe “the engineer.” Because I am interested in a snapshot of how engineering is depicted, I did not modify the twarc search syntax for “#engineering.” If, as one scholar has suggested, “the concept of the hashtag promises constancy and stability of the image,” then the hashtag offers some insight into the image of engineering<sup><a href=\"#note4\">4</a></sup>. I wanted a broad range of data from a diversity of users, so I started the search and let it run for several minutes before pausing it. The paused search returned 15,157 tweets sent between Friday, April 20, 2018 and Tuesday, April 24, 2018.\n\n\n\nQuestions I am interested in answering about this data include:\n\n<ul>\n\n \t<li>Why do people use the hashtag?</li>\n\n \t<li>Who uses the hashtag?</li>\n\n \t<li>What are the most popular or influential accounts and tweets using the hashtag?</li>\n\n \t<li>Who follows accounts that use the hashtag?</li>\n\n \t<li>Who RTs tweets with the hashtag and who follows them?</li>\n\n \t<li>How do people respond to tweets with the hashtag?</li>\n\n \t<li>What types of media, e.g. images and videos, accompany tweets with the hashtag?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nI can posit answers to some of these questions by using spreadsheets and word clouds to analyze the tweets. First, to understand why people might use the hashtag, I generated the word cloud in Fig. 1. It represents other hashtags that accounts used in addition to #engineering within the same tweet. To generate the word cloud, I copied the “hashtags” column from the .csv file into a free online tool, WordClouds.com. The bigger the word appears the more often it occurred.\n\n\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-19908\" src=\"https://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Figure-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"799\" height=\"502\" />\n\n\n\nThe words that occurred most often were related to jobs and hiring. Specifically, “CareerArc” is a company that specializes in online recruiting. I was surprised to see jimmyfallon on the word cloud. I discovered that it first appeared in this tweet:\n\n\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-19909\" src=\"https://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/jimmyfallon1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"615\" height=\"896\" />\n\n\n\nAnd, then it appears to have been scraped as a hashtag associated with engineering by an account promoting continuing education programs and tweeted over and over again:\n\n\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-19910\" src=\"https://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/jimmyfallon2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"619\" height=\"678\" />\n\n\n\nTo better understand who uses the hashtag, I copied and pasted user descriptions through the same word cloud generator. The results are displayed here:\n\n\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-19911\" src=\"https://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Cloud.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1067\" height=\"665\" />\n\n\n\n“Engineering” is the word that occured most often, which suggests that many of the accounts identify with or specialize in engineering somewhat exclusively. The other word that caught my eye was “Need.” Given the high occurrence of career related words, my initial guess was that perhaps users were sharing that they needed a job. However, a small sample of user descriptions with the word “need” suggests that they are framing their expertise as something that is needed. For example:\n\n\n\n“For all travelers in India, a Map of India is a must and thus the need for us to find the best map for you.” @MapsofIndia\n\n\n\n“Official account of Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University - Worldwide. Giving you exactly the education you need, exactly the way you need it.” @ERAUWorldwide\n\n\n\n“McFarland Johnson is a recognized leader in infrastructure planning, design &amp; construction management, serving the daily needs of communities throughout the US.” @McFar_Johnson\n\n\n\nTo better understand the “who,” I also used a pivot table to identify the top 10 accounts using #engineering. The results displayed in the table suggest that the hashtag is often used by accounts whose primary function is recruiting.\n\n\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-19914\" src=\"https://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Screen-Shot-2018-08-27-at-3.11.31-PM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"851\" height=\"1083\" />\n\n\n\nOf course, using the hashtag does not mean that the tweet is influential. To start to identify influential tweets I decided to look at favorited tweets because retweets seemed to be more automated, for example, a circle of accounts all retweeting the same content. Below are the top 10 most favorited tweets. Most of the tweets express wonder at the feats of #engineering. @colin_furze, who also has a YouTube account “with all the crazy inventions and projects,” appears 3 times. He has approximately 35,800 followers. Exploring how the invocation of wonder overlaps with the more pragmatic concern of getting a job could be the focus of future analysis.\n\n\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-19917\" src=\"https://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Untitled-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"861\" height=\"1740\" />\n\n\n\nI tried to find an easy way to visualize the network/assemblage swirling about #engineering. I do not have previous experience with this, but after a few emails and discovering that NodeXL does not work on on Apple computers, I found GEPHI. I downloaded it and realized it would take a little time to learn the software and properly format my data. Reading about the software, I learned about “nodes” (in the case of Twitter, users) and “edges” (connections between users). Since my own personal discovery, I have seen two scholars present on the work they did with GEPHI, and I realize it is commonly used for visualizing social media networks. To create a clearer picture of the influence of the accounts using the hashtag, mastering GEPHI might be the best next step. However, even with GEPHI, this dataset is limited, and therefore, it may or may not represent what the public assumes about engineering and engineers.\n\n\n\nIn terms of ethical questions, I realize that the twarc search may have captured private accounts, but the information I have included here seems to be from accounts intended to be public. My goal in collecting this data is to address an ethical question, specifically, “who we see as inventors <i>[or to use my word, engineers]</i>, what we see as creativity <i>[or to use my word, engineering]</i>, and on whose terms their ideas and practices are valued.”<sup><a href=\"#note5\">5</a></sup> Returning to Turner’s opening quote, this mini data story suggests that engineering culture is first about getting a job, not “about making the product.”<sup><a href=\"#note6\">6</a></sup> If that is the case, then the use of #engineering is a “digital redline” because it is potentially “creating and normalizing structural and systemic isolation” by constraining who becomes an engineer<sup><a href=\"#note7\">7</a></sup>. This constraint could function both materially (perhaps only certain people can see the job posts) and symbolically (perhaps the image of who is an engineer prohibits some people from pursuing those jobs). Equally important is how the explicit connection between engineering and economic opportunity may also constrain the actions of engineers. Remembering MacIntyre’s definition of character as placing “a certain kind of moral constraint on the personality of those who inhabit them,” the key questions to pursue include who can become the character who engineers and, what can the character of the engineer <i>engineer</i> when the prominent value is getting and keeping a job.<sup><a href=\"#note8\">8</a></sup>\n\n\n\n<strong>References</strong>\n\n\n\n<sup id=\"note1\">1</sup> Fred Turner, “Don't Be Evil: Fred Turner on Utopias, Frontiers, and Brogrammers,” <i>Logic Magazine,</i> <a href=\"//logicmag.io/03-dont-be-evil/\">https://logicmag.io/03-dont-be-evil/</a>.\n\n\n\n<sup id=\"note2\">2</sup> Alasdair MacIntyre, <i>After Virtue: A Study in Moral Theory</i> (Notre Dame, Ind.: University of Notre Dame Press, 2007), 27.\n\n\n\n<sup id=\"note3\">3</sup> Carrie A.

She will demonstrate how the elaborate Mandrake form operates, reveal her inspirations for the form, and discuss how the form evolved as it came into being. In addition, she will discuss how this originally paper-based kinetic poem came to be transformed into its current Flash-animated state, and enumerate the strengths and weaknesses of its two existent forms (its physical form on the printed page, and its digital Flash-animated form), especially as compared to its ideal form which currently exists only in concept.\r\r\n\r\r\nONI BUCHANAN is a young American pianist who focuses her virtuosity and inventiveness on creating and bringing to life themed concerts full of originality, curiosity, vitality, and a wide range of amazing piano works. Ms. Buchanan's concerts have been described as \"mesmerizing,\" \"insightful,\" \"exciting,\" \"inspiring,\" and full of \"flair, abandon, and color,\" and her audiences have felt \"transported,\" \"connected,\" and \"awed.\" She has performed solo recitals throughout the U.S. and abroad, at such venues as the Instituto Brasileiro de AdministraÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ£o Municipal (IBAM) in Rio de Janeiro, BRAZIL, the University of Guelph as well as Conrad Grebel University College in Ontario, CANADA, the Dame Myra Hess Memorial Concerts in Chicago, the Baltimore Museum of Art, and the Harvard University Hall Concert Series, among many others. Ms. Buchanan has been a guest soloist on many occasions, including performances for the Harvard Arts First festivals, the Harvard Music Department's Composer Colloquium series, the Cicada Festival Emerging Artists Recital (Mount Gretna, PA), and as the guest concerto soloist with the Waynesboro Orchestra (Waynesboro, VA), conducted by Eric Stassen. In addition, Ms. Buchanan has given ensemble performances in New England Conservatory's Jordan Hall, Harvard University, and at the New School of Music in Cambridge, MA.\r\r\n\r\r\nMs. Buchanan received her Master's degree in piano performance from the New England Conservatory of Music, her Bachelor's degree in music from the University of Virginia, and conducted three years of her music studies at the University of Iowa School of Music while pursuing an M.F.A. in poetry from the Iowa Writers' Workshop. In addition to her music degrees, Oni Buchanan holds a B.A. in English from the University of Virginia and an M.F.A. in poetry from the Iowa Writers' Workshop. Oni's second poetry manuscript, Spring, has just been selected by Mark Doty as a winner of the 2007 National Poetry Series Open Competition, and will be published by the University of Illinois Press in August 2008. Her first book of poems, What Animal, won the University of Georgia Press Contemporary Poetry Series competition (chosen by Fanny Howe), and was published in October 2003. Oni's poems are featured in several anthologies including The Best American Poetry 2004 and Legitimate Dangers: American Poets of the New Century, and have been published in numerous journals across the country, including Conduit, Seneca Review, and Gulf Coast. A Flash version of Oni Buchanan's kinetic poem \"The Mandrake Vehicles\" is on permanent display at the Conduit website, and she is currently at work on two other motion- and technology-driven poem projects.\r\r\n\r\r\nComing up @MITH 4/1: Sunil Iyengar (National Endowment for the Arts), \"To Read or Not to Read: A Discussion of the NEA's Latest Report about Reading.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nView MITH's complete Digital Dialogues schedule here:\r\r\n\r\r\nhttp://www.mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_spring_2008.pdf\r\r\n\r\r\nAll talks free and open to the public!\r\r\n\r\r\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-8927).",

    "wp post content": "<a href=\"http://www.i-d-e.de/workshop-tools-for-the-digital-edition-2011\" target=\"_blank\">Link to the Event</a>\n\nOn Monday, November 28th and Tuesday, November 29th, Dave Lester (Creative Lead for MITH) and I (Web Developer for MITH) attended the <a href=\"http://www.i-d-e.de/\" target=\"_blank\">Institute fuer Dokumentologie and Editorik (I-D-E)</a> workshop for Tools for Digital Scholarly Editions held at the University of Cologne, Germany. Alexander Czmiel from the University of Berlin and fellow for the I-D-E had invited Dave Lester and then me to the conference to give a report on the <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/tile/\" target=\"_blank\">Text and Image Linking Environment (TILE)</a> project. In addition, I helped organize a report on my work done with the Interedition team for interoperable annotation clients. This would be MITH’s first appearance on the scene of the University of Cologne, which houses multiple institutions for Digital Humanities related projects and research affiliates: the <a href=\"http://www.i-d-e.de/\" target=\"_blank\">I-D-E</a>, as mentioned before, the <a href=\"http://www.cceh.uni-koeln.de/\" target=\"_blank\">Cologne Center for eHumanities (CCeH)</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.icar-us.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">International Center for Archival Research (ICARus)</a>.\n\nAfter arriving at the workshop location, which was at a rather new and improved location on the Cologne campus, we met with Alexander Czmiel and his colleague, Patrick Sahle. As participants filtered in, Patrick and Alex started things off by introducing themselves and their mission: to establish a global community of Digital Humanities programmers focused on working together on scholarly editions. Their point is similar to that of Interedition, which focuses on establishing programmer networks to prevent duplicity of efforts and tools. To paraphrase Joris Van Zundert, lead for the Interedition project, “You don’t need two collation engines [fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=\"yes\" overflow=\"visible\"][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=\"1_1\" background_position=\"left top\" background_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" border_color=\"\" border_style=\"solid\" spacing=\"yes\" background_image=\"\" background_repeat=\"no-repeat\" padding=\"\" margin_top=\"0px\" margin_bottom=\"0px\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_direction=\"left\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" center_content=\"no\" min_height=\"none\"][sic]”. Indeed, as every one of the approximately 40 participants introduced themselves, we found many intersections in our projects and in our research. In order to better work together, the workshop was set for each of us to unconference ideas together and brainstorm ways forward. The workshop’s focus then quickly switched to what, exactly, it is that each of us is working on and how it might be different or similar.\n\nTo aid with this, we proceeded to give or listen to a series of 15-20 minute presentations on specific projects. Each of them was an interesting take on the idea of linking data together with marked-up text or image files. Here’s a list of them to peruse:\n<ul>\n\t<li>CATMA, Marco Petris (<a href=\"http://www.catma.de/\" target=\"_blank\">www.catma.de</a>)</li>\n\t<li>CollateX, Ronald Dekker (<a href=\"http://collatex.sourceforge.net/\" target=\"_blank\">collatex.sourceforge.net</a>)</li>\n\t<li>TextGrid, Ubbo Ventjeer &amp; Yahya Al-Hajj (http://www.textgrid.de/en.html)</li>\n\t<li>DigiLib, Robert Casties (<a href=\"http://digilib.berlios.de/\" target=\"_blank\">http://digilib.berlios.de/</a>)</li>\n\t<li>TILE, Dave Lester &amp; Grant Dickie</li>\n\t<li>OpenAnnotation, Grant Dickie, Marco Petris &amp; Moritz Wissenbach</li>\n\t<li>xMod (<a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/JMVieira/\" target=\"_blank\">https://bitbucket.org/jmvieira</a>), Miguel Vieira</li>\n\t<li>SADE, Alexander Czmiel (Currently under development, but here’s a link to his institution, the IDE:<a href=\"http://www.i-d-e.de/\" target=\"_blank\"> www.i-d-e.de</a>)</li>\n\t<li>MOM-CA, Jochen Graf (http://www.mom-wiki.uni-koeln.de/MOM-CA2/Metadata)</li>\n</ul>\nThe result of these presentations was an agreement that the Digital Humanities has a similar need across institutions for SVG annotations, exporting and importing TEI data and annotation data, and automatically linking lines and text together in a seamless fashion. Obviously, there is no one interface currently available (nor will there ever be, in my opinion) that can manage all of this, so the idea of arguing over what platform to incorporate our efforts in was found useless. Instead, we were encouraged to split up the workshop into sub-groups that focused on development and institutional planning goals that fit with what we wanted out of the event.\n\nAs with the presentations, there was too much information, engaging arguments, and fascinating ideas brought up in these sub-sessions to report it all in a single blog posting. What I can write about is the proceedings of the two sessions I was involved in: the Text and Image Linking group and the Annotation Framework sub-group.\n\n“Text and Image Linking” started off with a more in-depth description of the TILE project and what it does. Moritz Wissenbach then expanded on how he took the code from TILE and implemented it into his own project, Faust Edition, thus creating a quasi-interoperable connection between the projects. From there, we argued that small collaborations such as this can build a kind of network of data between projects that works around institutional and project boundaries. Robert Casties of DigiLib asked some very interesting questions, such as why we chose TILE as a framework and how or if our collective data could support the massive amount of metadata his users require. Marco Petris of the CATMA project in Hamburg had similar concerns for such a collaboration: What if collaborating means making an unspoken contract and forces a specific agenda on a project otherwise adverse to the ideas of something like TILE? Are we simply fitting a square peg into a round hole, to use a (poor) allegory? How do these smaller connections effect the global Digital Humanities community? In order to continue these conversations and (hopefully) reach some kind of consensus or possible white paper, Ulrike Henny from Cologne established the Text and Image Linking e-mail list: textimagelinking <strong>at</strong> uni-koeln <strong>dot</strong> de.\n\n“Annotation Frameworks” had a very similar subset of participants which carried over from the Text and Image Linking subgroup. As a representative of MITH, I spoke to our work on collaborating with the <a href=\"http://www.openannotation.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Open Annotation Collaboration (OAC)</a> to develop an open-source and extensible framework for annotations. This, we believe, would allow for other users and programmers to take our saved annotations and use them in their own work, since the OAC specifications are so flexible and open. Robert Casties continued his argument about how a universal model for data exchange as proposed at the Darmstadt Bootcamp for Interedition and OAC would not fully realize some goals for metadata. Moritz and my argument was that it could encompass everything a researcher may need, pending we as programmers remain transparent about our code and our research. Again, the final conclusion was that we needed to clarify and continue our arguments online and through e-mail.\n\nThis conclusion was shared by many of the sub-groups who all presented brief, 5 minute overviews of their findings. Central to a lot of the arguments were how we are all similar in goals, yet very different in use cases, funding, and programming time. What we really need, as the “DH Community Planning” sub-group reported, is a common outlet for collaborating and exchanging ideas outside of the workshop. Joris Van Zundert made an eloquent defense for sticking with a path of collaboration and working around institutional boundaries. This led to much discussion on the issue of “What to do next”. Dave Lester now plans to head up an initiative to get Interedition Bootcamps split between the United States and Europe (I’ll let him explain that more). Several institution partners vowed to use the Stanford University e-mail list for DH community planners. On the development side, we all promised to work hard on our own, off-work time to develop prototypes and working proof-of-concepts of interoperable tools in order to get more funding for projects such as Interedition.\n\nFor my MITH development time, this conference has led to several engaging opportunities. TextGridLab, a software framework created at the Goettingen University in Germany, has interest in connecting their own image and text linking tool to TILE’s. It is possible that this collaboration could serve as a working example of the kind of outcome we want from the Text and Image Linking group. Several of us also have interest in taking a closer look at an Automatic Line Recognition system used by developers Daniel Hochstrasser and Tobias Rindlisbacher of Zurich. As for the Image Linking e-mail list, I’ve already contributed my own thoughts there and Robert Sanderson of OAC and the Shared Canvas project have gotten more users engaged in talking through that medium. I and MITH are very excited at the connections made and look forward to future collaborative conferences such as this one. It only goes to show that it only takes a relatively small effort to create interesting and powerful tools for the DH community.\n\n<em>Editor's note</em>: This post originally appeared at <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20140119103801/http://grantdickie.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Grant Dickie's blog</a> on January 4, 2012.[/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]",

    "wp post content": "Last  week, MITH Director Neil Fraistat traveled to the 2012 Modern Language  Association (MLA) Convention to work with literary scholars interested  in exploring digital humanities and alternative academic careers, while  our own Associate Director Matt Kirschenbaum was being quoted in the <em>New York Times</em> by the critic Stanley Fish.\n\nSpeaking at MLA on <a href=\"http://www.mla.org/program_details?prog_id=M055C\">\"#alt-ac: The Future of \"Alternative Academic\" Careers,\"</a> Fraistat explored with other leading digital humanists the trend  towards hybrid and non-tenure-track academic positions in libraries,  university presses, cultural heritage organizations, and digital  humanities organizations. He launched his efforts by participating in a  day-long<a href=\"http://dhcommons.org/\"> </a>pre-conference workshop, as part of his position as co-chair of <a href=\"http://digitalhumanities.org/centernet/\">centerNet</a>,  to work with language and literature scholars who sought to learn about  or join the digital humanities community. Capped by an exciting and  well-attended launch of <a href=\"http://dhcommons.org/\">DHCommons</a>,  a new registry designed to match such scholars with existing digital  initiatives and established digital-humanities scholars, Neil's  activities in Seattle were an impressive example of the growth of  digital approaches within literary studies.\n\nKirschenbaum addressed this \"alternative academic\" trend and its effects in Fish's latest op-ed, <a href=\"http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/09/the-digital-humanities-and-the-transcending-of-mortality/?scp=1&amp;sq=Digital%20humanities%20stanley%20fish&amp;st=cse\">\"The Digital Humanities and the Transcending of Mortality\"</a> (January 9, 2012). Matt highlights the effects of the digital  humanities on current academic conditions. \"Amid an increasingly  monstrous institutional terrain defined by declining public support for  higher education, rising tuitions, shrinking endowments,\" Kirschenbaum  is quoted, \"[fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=\"yes\" overflow=\"visible\"][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=\"1_1\" background_position=\"left top\" background_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" border_color=\"\" border_style=\"solid\" spacing=\"yes\" background_image=\"\" background_repeat=\"no-repeat\" padding=\"\" margin_top=\"0px\" margin_bottom=\"0px\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_direction=\"left\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" center_content=\"no\" min_height=\"none\"][and] the proliferation of distance education and the  for-profit university,\" the digital humanities, through organizations  like DHCommons and centerNet, seeks to create a support network of  universities and researchers that offer solutions to the decline of  traditional structures like tenure and promotion, in order to offer new  approaches to humanities scholarship.\n\nMITH  is thrilled to see such extensive engagement from these reputable  organizations!

    "wp post content": "I recently came across a 1991 <a href=\"http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2225/the-art-of-criticism-no-1-harold-bloom\" target=\"_blank\">interview</a> of the literary critic Harold Bloom (Sterling Professor of Humanities at Yale University) in The Paris Review, in the course of which Bloom remarks:\n\n\"As far as I’m concerned, computers have as much to do with literature as space travel, perhaps much less.\"\n\nSince coming here (to MITH) as an intern this summer, I have learned about several projects that just might make Bloom change his mind.  In the last few weeks, I have been working on one such project, along with Travis Brown and Clay Templeton here at MITH, that utilizes cutting-edge work on topic modeling currently being done in University of Maryland’s Computer Science department. Clay has already written about the project in his previous blog post, and so I will simply use this opportunity to express some reflection of my own.\n\nThe question of “scale” has been on my mind over the past couple of weeks. We are processing vast amounts of text data — topic modeling is the kind of approach whose power of discovery is predicated on the assumption that vast amounts of textual data will be available for it to run on. It makes me pause and reflect that the assumption that these approaches will “scale up” quantitatively to continue to become more prominent and visible in the coming years, rests on some deeper technological and social assumptions. That is, increased success for these approaches is going to depend on Moore’s Law continuing to hold (i.e., more and more processing power being available more and more cheaply), and also on the willingness (and legal feasibility) of those libraries and institutions that own such vast repositories of texts to make them available in computer-readable formats.\n\nEarlier, our group here at MITH was working with the “unsupervised” topic modeling approach, in which no knowledge of the content of the text is really needed — the algorithm simply cranks away at whatever text corpus it is working on, and discovers topics from it. For the last week or so, though, we have focused on the brand-new and cutting-edge “supervised” topic modeling approach that is being developed by a research group in the Computer Science department here at Maryland. The idea in this kind of “supervised” topic modeling is to “train” the algorithm by making use of domain knowledge. For example, in conjunction with the Civil War era newspaper archive with which we are working, we are making use of such related pieces of knowledge (coming from contemporaneous sources external to our corpus) as the casualty rate for each week, and the Consumer Price Index for each month. The idea behind this approach is that the algorithm will discover more “meaningful” topics if it has a way to make use of feedback regarding how well the topics discovered by it are associated with a parameter of interest. Thus, if we are trying to bias the algorithm into discovering topics that pertain more directly to the Civil War and its effects, then it will make sense to align the aforementioned “other kinds of data” such as — in our case, casualty figures and economic figures for the era — which have a provenance outside the text corpus. This is where the “qualitative” scale becomes important.\n\nThe more intelligently we try to leverage these approaches’ power, the sheer number of areas with which the successful practitioner of this kind of topic modeling approach will, therefore, have to have at least a passing acquaintance, will “scale” up. This made me think about how people trained in information science — which is a truly interdisciplinary field — are really well-positioned to do this. Over the last week, for example, I read several papers on the economic history of the Civil War (which we were pointed to by Robert K. Nelson, a historian at the University of Richmond who has worked on topic modeling and history). Who would have guessed that one would have to read Civil War papers in the course of a summer internship in Information Science?  I aligned the economic data with the text corpus, and based on what the data seemed to be telling us, I came up with a <a href=\"http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bhattach/econhyp.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">design for some experiments</a> to test out some hypotheses, which we will proceed to carry out over the next few days.\n\nAlso, in a piece of exciting news, the <a href=\"http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bhattach/RhetoricConferenceAbstractFinal.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">paper proposal</a> that we (Travis, Clay, and I) submitted to the “Making Meaning” conference for graduate students, organized by the Program in Rhetoric at the English Department of the University of Michigan, has been accepted. This presentation will reflect on how one might situate approaches like topic modeling in the context of literary theory and philosophy. This, too, is an example of how as “information scientists” we must see, and think, in terms of the “big picture” — that is, scale up to the big picture.\n\nP.S. Now that this post turned out to be a reflection on the question of scale, it just occurred to me that it is also appropriate that the programming language I learned during the earlier part of the internship was — <a href=\"http://www.artima.com/scalazine/articles/scalable-language.html\" target=\"_blank\">Scala</a>!",

    "wp post content": "We now have two versions of a demos up and ready to run. Both allow a user to pull data from the witness files, containing manuscript transcriptions, select texts to compare, run the texts through a version of CollateX, then present the results as an alignment table (a “synopsis” in or “partitur” in some text-critical dialects), and as a text with apparatus.\n\nThe second of these is still buggy (and the cause of both a couple of late nights night and the lateness of this post (for which I apologize heartily to the nice people at MITH)), but it does a couple of additional things:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Prioritization. While the ability to generate all sorts of different apparatus is a desideratum, at present what we can do is choose the order in which results are presented, and, in the case of presenting a text with apparatus, the first text chosen becomes the base text for comparison.</li>\n\t<li>Tokenizing. I am now able to tokenize in two steps. First with “rich” tokens that retain data about the individual words (e.g., abbreviations, which should be compared based on their expanded text rather than on the abbreviation as written), as well as other data in the text (page breaks, etc). From there we can create “regularized” tokens. For now I have regularized the tokens by removing all yods and waws. Additional candidates might include dealing with prepositions that are sometimes but not always attached in medieval Mishnah manuscripts (shel, e.g.), final aleph/heh, and final nun/mem. “Simple” tokens are passed to Collatex (or, we allow Collatex to process “rich” tokens) and the resulting collation output is merged with the rich tokens.</li>\n\t<li>Presentation. Because the “rich” tokens retain information about the witness, it is possible to generate a “text-with-apparatus” in which the base text can be presented with formatting and contextual information that may be useful to the reader. (Disclaimer: Here is a big bug: The XSLT that joins the two lists of tokens inserts the non-words (page breaks etc.) in a position that is offset by one location. Any suggestions?)</li>\n</ul>\nNext up: modifying the demo to present multi-column synopses, and linking in Talmudic and Commentary citations.\n\n<em>Hayim Lapin is Robert H.

As a consequence, I have developed a new model to help scaffold the design of data-driven interactive projects called ASSERT. <em>Ask</em> a question; <em>Search</em> for evidence to answer that question; <em>Structure</em> the data; <em>Envision</em> ways to answer the question using the structured data; <em>Represent</em> that data in a compelling interactive manner; and finally, <em>Tell</em> a story using that data to answer the question.\n\n\n\nThis talk will take place in the Human Computer Interaction Lab, 2117 Hornbake Library (South).\n\n\n\n<strong>Bill Ferster</strong> directs the <a href=\"http://www.viseyes.org/\" target=\"_blank\">VisualEyes Project</a> at the University of Virginia with a joint faculty appointment with the Center for Technology and Teacher Education at the Curry School of Education, and with the  Sciences, Humanities &amp; Arts Technology Initiative (SHANTI)  at the College of Arts and Sciences.\n\n\n\nIn past lives, he founded StageTools, a leading developer of digital motion control tools with its MovingPicture product; Editing Machines, EMMY award winning developer of the first digital nonlinear editing system; and West End, a pioneer in PC-based animation and presentation graphics tools.\n\n\n\nA continuously updated schedule of talks is also available on the Digital Dialogues webpage.\n\n\n\nUnable to attend the events in person?\n\n\n\nArchived podcasts can be found on the MITH website, and you can follow our Digital Dialogues Twitter account @digdialog as well as the Twitter hashtag #mithdd to keep up with live tweets from our sessions.\n\n\n\nAll talks free and open to the public.

In different ways, scholars' debates about publishing, tenure and promotion systems, libraries' straining budgets and physical spaces, and funding agencies' new mandates require that all these communities engage with basic research on and professional practice of data curation in order to fulfill their missions. In the sciences, the expectation that data supporting published research will be available for review and re-use is becoming more common and any fundamental reform of peer review in the humanities would hopefully encompass a similar position on the relationship between data and publications. Moreover, the acceptance of digital projects as scholarship depends on the data for these projects continuing to remain available. In an era of abundant, networked information, a crucial part of the value proposition of libraries will depend on their ability to steward unique local resources and invent new services to meet the evolving needs of students and research faculty. Funding agencies have begun to mandate data management plans in order to protect their investment of public funds in research but these agencies will need advice from the scholarly community and libraries to refine and fully operationalize these mandates.\n\n\n\nFor humanists, librarians, and the public, which remains deeply invested in the subjects and materials of the humanities, data curation is not a passing fad or a temporary innovation; data curation is an important part of the solution to many key challenges in the conduct and support of innovative research in the humanities. This talk will explore how humanists, librarians, and members of the wider public might all learn \"on the job\", as it were, to participate in the curation of data through changes to core courses in humanists' professional training, through inflecting numerous existing positions throughout libraries with a new data curation focus, and through open sharing of tools, strategies and best practices in a manner that acknowledges the opportunities for peer-to-peer training.\n\n\n\nThis talk will be held in the MITH Conference Room, in the basement of McKeldin Library.\n\n\n\nTrevor Muñoz is Associate Director of MITH as well as Assistant Dean for Digital Humanities Research at the <a href=\"http://www.lib.umd.edu/\">University of Maryland Libraries</a>. Trevor holds an MA in Digital Humanities from the <a href=\"http://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/ddh/index.aspx\">Department of Digital Humanities at King's College London</a> and a MS in Library and Information Science from the <a href=\"http://www.lis.illinois.edu/\">Graduate School of Library and Information Science at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign</a>. He specializes in curation of humanities data, with a particular emphasis on developing joint research ventures between the Libraries, MITH, and other academic faculty at Maryland.\n\n\n\nCOMING UP @MITH 11/8: Peter Kay (VP, Director of Digital Marketing and Strategy at W.W.

The study of issues of pressing concern in the 21st century? The reconceptualization of historical studies in light of these concerns? The deployment of 21st century modes of research, analysis, and presentation? Richard Grusin, the new director of the Center for 21st Century Studies (C21) at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, will argue that C21 is in a unique position to define the future of 21st century studies. As the only center of its kind, C21 should take as its mission the development of 21st century studies as an interdisciplinary field. Doing so will allow C21 to set the terms of the debate about the future of 21st century studies for the decades ahead as well as to open the door for collaborations with other individuals and institutions interested in defining the future of 21st century studies.\n\nRICHARD GRUSIN is Professor of English and Director of the Center for 21st Century Studies at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Previously he was a professor at the College of William and Mary, Georgia Institute of Technology, and Wayne State University. He served as department chair from 1996-99 at Georgia Tech and from 2001-2008 at Wayne State. Grusin received his Ph.D. from the University of California at Berkeley in 1983. He has published numerous chapters and articles and written four books.  He is best known for his foundational work in new media studies. With Jay David Bolter he is the author of Remediation: Understanding New Media (MIT, 1999), which sketches out a genealogy of new media, beginning with the contradictory visual logics underlying contemporary digital media. His most recent book, <em>Premediation: Affect and Mediality After 9/11</em> (Palgrave, 2010), argues that in an era of heightened securitization, socially networked US and global media work to pre-mediate collective affects of anticipation and connectivity, while also perpetuating low levels of apprehension or fear.\n\nA continuously updated schedule of talks is also available on the <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/podcast/\"><strong>Digital Dialogues webpage</strong></a>.\n\nUnable to attend the events in person?

Larsen, Kirschenbaum remarks, is “also somebody who is broadly interested in computer culture.” The <em>DLC</em> contains many newspaper and magazine articles and clipped comics on issues such as Internet privacy, the growth of email, law and the Internet, and the frustrations computing tools can bring to the average user, among others. “I think,” Kirschenbaum adds, “the collection has some value as a cross section of a certain moment in popular computer history as well from roughly 1985 to 2000.”\n\nOne great aspect of the <em>DLC</em>, is researchers are encouraged to dig into the collection’s many artifacts. “We offered to take [fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=\"yes\" overflow=\"visible\"][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=\"1_1\" background_position=\"left top\" background_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" border_color=\"\" border_style=\"solid\" spacing=\"yes\" background_image=\"\" background_repeat=\"no-repeat\" padding=\"\" margin_top=\"0px\" margin_bottom=\"0px\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_direction=\"left\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" center_content=\"no\" min_height=\"none\"][<em>The Deena Larsen Collection</em>] here at Maryland,” Kirschenbaum explains, “with the understanding that we are not an archive, that we are not a unit of University Special Collections: We are a Digital Humanities Center. We were interested in the collection as a research test bed and so we wanted a set of born-digital materials we could actually work with, that a student could work with, and which also…were interesting.” In fact, while MITH is involved with a great number of <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/research/\" target=\"_blank\">projects</a>, <em>The Deena Larsen Collection</em> is the only one actually housed on site, taking up physical space within the MITH offices.\n\nWith those things in mind I was encouraged to explore the collection.\n\nI used the Finding Aid binder (more on the Finding Aid <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/hands-on-the-dlc-finding-and-finding-aids\" target=\"_self\">next post</a>) to see which Mac Classic or Mac SE was still running. Sadly, my first choice, a Mac Classic II identified as M1, had stopped working since it’s last check-up in May 2009, and the screen never resolved:\n\n<a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DLC_mac_classic_II_fail.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright\" title=\"Mac_Classic_II\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DLC_mac_classic_II_fail_sm.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n\n(In case you are wondering about the markings on the side, yes, Deena did buy a pallet of surplussed computers from the Denver Public School, which she stores in her temperature controlled crawl space (I have crawled in it)…but that is a story for another time.)\n\nFortunately, the Macintosh SE, labeled M2, booted right up. I was able to use the SE and the Finding Aid devoted to the 800+ 3.5 inch floppy disks (more on these next post) that are in the collection to locate disks devoted to <em>Marble Springs, Second Edition</em>, and look through various drafts.\n\n(A brief aside: As I was working, I became aware of a creeping nostalgia. At first I could not figure out the cause. Then I realized it was the sound of the Mac SE working, with its characteristic grunts, and clunks, and whirs. If you would like a listen, play the attached sound file: <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/MS_MAC_SE.mp3\">MS_MAC_SE.mp3 </a> or <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/MS_MAC_SE.m4v\">MS_MAC_SE.m4v</a>, depending on your software. It lasts about 2 minutes.)\n\nSome of the archivists out there might be cringing at this point: “They let him turn on a 20-year-old Macintosh and pop in disks? Are they crazy?!?” This concern was certainly at the center of planning for the <em>DLC. </em>\n\n“We have been entrusted with the material, and we take that seriously, and it is part of our mission to do right by it,” Kirschenbaum says. Of the Mac Classics he poses “one could ask are these artifacts first and foremost to be preserved? Are they tools? Are they instruments of access?”\n\nFor the <em>DLC</em>, the answer is a bit of all three. On a practical level, the <em>DLC </em>does not have the resources to leave usable tools on the shelf. On the other hand MITH is seeking ways to work with University of Maryland <a href=\"http://ischool.umd.edu\" target=\"_blank\">iSchool</a> faculty to utilize the <em>DLC</em> materials in archiving or preservation classes. Students, under the supervision of MITH staff, have been able to practice imaging disks using the <em>DLC</em> disk collection.\n\n“We have a lot of respect for the collection, we have a lot of affection for it, we do everything we can for it,” Kirschenbaum said warmly, “but we also see it as something to be used.”\n\nFurther, Kirschenbaum feels the MITH approach to <em>The Deena Larsen Collection</em> is in keeping with Larsen’s own collaborative and supportive approach to the creation of e-literature.\n\n“Our hope is there will be a modest number of researchers who will find their way here…every year,” he added.\n\nSo in the collaborative spirit, my next post will describe my adventures researching in <em>The Deena Larsen Collection</em>, in hopes of making your visit more productive.\n\n<strong>Up next: </strong><em>Hands on the DLC: Finding and Finding Aids</em>\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\nWant to schedule a visit to the <em>DLC</em>?

    "wp post content": "I began my career as a graduate student in literature knowing that, with how literary studies stand now, I would have to choose for my focus between my two great fascinations: 19th-century Russian and 20th-century American literature. The former seemed pre-destined to remain a hobby or a neglected interest. But thanks to the inventiveness of Foreign Literatures in America as well as to the slippery categories of \"foreign,\" \"literatures,\" and \"America(n)\" that the project seeks to explore, I have found an exciting professional opportunity to open up scholarly avenues between these two disciplinary fields.  No one, of course, could argue that so-called American literature exists outside a world genealogy of writing that looks to Tolstoy, Dostoevsky et al. as masters of their arts.  Were an undergraduate or graduate student to pursue and argue for the importance of a Russian text's influence on an American one, professors and the scholarly community could not deny the validity of such an argument. In such a transnational project, however, the sense remains that not only are geographic, political, and temporal  boundaries crossed but also violated are the sometimes seemingly more strictly policed border of disciplinary fields. Although, beyond Foreign Literatures in America, American literary studies are moving in different ways toward boundary-troubling methodologies, the field retains a strong residual definition as constitutively, for example, \"not-Russian,\" not that which is foreign.  The FLA project works to liberate us from that sensibility. Rather than passively accepting the borders of American literature as a line marking zones of inclusion and exclusion to be crossed, FLA makes the move of being all inclusive, recognizing the historicity of borders and disciplinary categories while illuminating and giving primacy of inquiry to the networks of cultural influence that underlie and overlay those categories.  Thus, as Executive Editor of the FLA's Russian Authors digital archive, I am given scholarly legitimacy as an (aspiring) Americanist to explore the impact of text authored outside the United States upon text authored within, all under the newly inclusive umbrella of American literary studies.\n\nOf course, as one person in a large, ambitious but new and still growing project, I am still in the first stages of this Russian Authors archive.  So far I've put together a foundational collection of reception materials about Dostoevsky from a variety of periodicals from 1900-1945.  Tolstoy is my next subject, and already reception of his works have proved much more widespread, so I've extended my time frame from 1890-1960.  Neither of these collections is intended to be complete; both are meant to be starting points with much work still waiting to be done by current and future FLA participants.\n\nThis endeavor has occasioned two main obstacles, but both have hopefully been effectively conquered.  First, developing a methodology for collecting and curating digital materials was a challenge; although I am quite computer literate, this has been my first archival and digital project.  Along with the rest of the Executive Board, I had to discover by trial and error the most effective way to store our data and meta-data for documents.  At this time we have decided upon standards for collecting and cataloging documents, but I suspect that we will have to continue adapting as we encounter new issues as FLA grows.  The second obstacle was transforming analogue documents into digital items.  Microfilm has been my primary source for reception materials, and a large portion of the reproductions are not good enough quality for optical character recognition (OCR).  Still, the Executive Board has generally agreed that it is still worthwhile to collect imperfect copies of documents even if they are not computer-legible.  As a result, in the future others can contribute to the archival aspect of FLA by locating better quality copies; rather than viewing this imperfection as a problem, we can treat it as an open invitation for people to participate in small or large ways.\n\nIn closing, I can only emphasize the professional opportunities the FLA embodies to re-imagine literary discourse.\n\n<em>Nicholas Slaughter is in the Department of English at the University of Maryland.</em>",

MEI to VexFlow is a JavaScript program that interfaces with VexFlow to render music notation expressed in the MEI format. The Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) is a community-driven effort to create a commonly-accepted, digital, symbolic representation of music notation documents. My goal is to boost the MEI to VexFlow library's capabilities in order to support MEI variant handling. Variant handling in music editing is a substantial problem for the digital editing, musicological and performing musician community.\n\nBeing a classical musician, recently graduated (Bachelor of Music) and currently part-time student at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, and also a software engineer, I am now trying to combine my expertise in these two areas. My primary field of interest within the intersection of music and computing is notation and digital publishing, especially from the performing musician's point-of-view. I have long been interested in the way we will use digital sheet music in the future with special regards to today's trends in music editing and publication; now my aim is to make an impact on the development of the related technologies.\n\nI feel honoured to be accepted at the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) that allows me to join the MITH for the summer months, and I am very much looking forward to work with my mentor at MITH, <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/people/person/raffaele-viglianti/\" title=\"Raffaele Viglianti\">Raffaele Viglianti</a>, who regularly contributes to MEI-to-VexFlow and is a respected member of the MEI community. I have big hopes for learning a lot from him and from other team members at the MITH, and also I would like to take the opportunity for paving the way for future projects and development in this area.",

    "wp post content": "It is a bittersweet moment to announce that MITH’s Associate Director Doug Reside will be leaving us to become the first ever digital curator for the performing arts at the New York Public Library.\n\nIn introducing Doug Reside at the beginning of a “Digital Dialogue,” I once described him as “the beating heart of MITH.” While this metaphor may be a bit graphic, it speaks exactly to how, in so many important ways, Doug has made MITH tick over the past five years.\n\nI could, for instance, point to how, since his arrival at MITH five years ago, Doug has brilliantly developed and completed a series of grants that have helped MITH both gain an international profile in digital tool building and develop widely recognized expertise in the digital documentation and preservation of the performing arts.  His multimedia XML markup tool <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/research/?project=19\">AXE</a>, alone, has been at the center of three grants from the Mellon Foundation and the NEH—and, of course, research projects and funding make MITH go. I could point to how Doug has been instrumental in establishing partnerships for MITH with such institutions as the Library of Congress, the Folger Shakespeare Library, the British Library, the Bodleian Library, and the Walters Art Gallery—and, of course, such partnerships make MITH go. I could point to how Doug has worked productively with MITH Faculty Fellows—and, of course, Faculty Fellows make MITH go. I could point to how Doug has taught three fabulous courses in the digital humanities to faculty, students, and staff—and, of course, such educational outreach makes MITH go. Finally, I could point to how--first as assistant director and more recently as associate director—Doug has brilliantly overseen all the work of MITH’s technical staff, from programmers, to Web developers, to designers, to GAs, to student interns–and, of course, without that work, MITH couldn’t go at all.\n\nBut Doug’s contribution to MITH extends beyond even these considerable achievements. It is not just in usually being the first one to arrive in the morning and the last one to leave that Doug has set the tone for MITH. Even more important is that in all he does Doug has the human touch: he is someone everyone at MITH respects, admires, and seeks out, and he has played a crucial role in helping to make MITH into a tightly-knit community, rather than a mere workplace.\n\nTo know Doug is also to know how passionate he is about musical theatre and the performing arts.  Although we will greatly miss him, we are thrilled that Doug has been able to find what is for him a dream job, and we wish him the brilliant future we know is waiting for him in New York!\n\nNeil Fraistat",

Cindy will be taking care of MITH's business in the fullest sense of the word, helping to keep MITH functioning efficiently and smoothly. You'll find her at the front desk when you visit MITH, or at the other end of the phone when you call. Please stop by and introduce yourself to her!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Doug Reside</strong>, who has recently defended his dissertation at the University of Kentucky, will be joining MITH as Assistant Director. As an undergraduate, Doug was a double major in Computer Science and English. His dissertation was a multimedia edition of the American musical, Parade, and while at Kentucky he worked on several humanities computing projects, including Kevin Kiernan's celebrated Electronic Boethius. Doug brings to MITH strong skills as a programmer (notably Java and PHP) and as a working scholar in the Digital Humanities.  He is very much looking forward to working closely with MITH Fellows, engaging in MITH's in-house research, and becoming a vital member of the MITH community. Look for him beginning on September 25th. I'd like to give special thanks to the Search Committee, who worked so diligently and so well on this appointment: Matt Kirschenbaum (Chair), Kathy Cavanaugh, Patti Cossard, Greg Lord, and Bini Tecle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn welcoming our two new staff members, I'd also like to thank publicly the two who have changed jobs over the summer. As many of you know, <strong>Carl Stahmer</strong> has returned for family reasons to San Diego, from where he is now operating actively as a Research Associate for MITH. <strong>Kevin Fries</strong>, who for the past three years has served so genially as MITH's administrative assistant, is now a TA for the English Department. While we'll miss their daily presence, both Carl and Kevin will still be active members of the MITH community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking forward to seeing many of you at MITH this Fall! Neil",

First, it identifies the videogame itself as a text in the general sense: the object of study, the type of artifact which is here subjected to analysis. Second, the specific textual phenomenon which will be the focus of this presentation is, literally, videogame text -- that is, the design, appearance, and uses of alphanumeric characters within videogames. By situating videogame typography in an appropriate historical, cultural, and technological context, an analysis of letter and number forms and their uses on the videogame screen can yield insights into the design history and dissemination of videogame texts. Further, the aesthetic properties of videogame text are shown to be one means by which specific videogame platforms express their influence over videogame discourse.  This presentation, which summarizes the major research of my dissertation, will focus on typography in early videogame systems. It will also include a demonstration of a data-mining tool developed for this purpose.\r\n\r\nZACH WHALEN is an Assistant Professor in the English, Linguistics and Communication Department of the University of Mary Washington. He recently completed his PhD at the University of Florida, and his collection, co-edited with Laurie N. Taylor, _Playing the Past: History and Nostalgia in Videogames_ has recently been published by the Vanderbilt University Press. He has published several journal articles and book chapters on videogames and new media studies and is currently completing a book on videogame typography.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nComing up @MITH 10/21: Kathleen Fitzpatrick, (Pomona College) \"Planned Obsolescence: Publishing, Technology, and the Future of the Academy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nView MITH's complete Digital Dialogues schedule here:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20100608224835/http://www.mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_fall_2008.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll talks free and open to the public!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-8927).",

Ideally, faculty MITH fellows will be relieved of teaching responsibilities during the fellowship period (half-time for a year-long residence in MITH) and prospective fellows should apply to their unit, to their Dean, to one of the university's research or instructional improvement support award programs, and to outside sources for funds to support course buyouts. Librarians will be relieved of the equivalent of half-time yearly teaching duties and should seek support from the Dean of Libraries and outside funding sources.\n\n\n\nFellowships will be offered to professors and/or librarians developing their research, teaching, and information studies work in ways that implement and productively exploit electronic resources, with preference given to those who have worked especially to integrate their scholarly discoveries and methods into their pedagogy, mentoring, and library practices. Besides working on their proposed project, fellows are expected to present their work in MITH's Digital Dialogue series and to become active members in the MITH community.\n\n\n\nThose interested in applying for a MITH fellowship should contact Neil Fraistat, Director of MITH (<a href=\"mailto:fraistat@umd.edu\">fraistat@umd.edu</a>) in order to formulate a strategy (for course relief and other support) for a successful MITH residency. Further information about the MITH Resident Fellowship, as well as application instructions, can be found at <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/community/fellowships/\">http://www.mith2.umd.edu/about/fellowsprogram.php</a>.\n\n\n\nApplications should be submitted to Neil Fraistat at MITH and are due by Monday, May 4; notifications will be made by May 12.",

    "wp post content": "The first thing you hear, or at least that you should hear, when you present an idea for a digital humanities project to someone already familiar with the field is this: \"That's great! [fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=\"yes\" overflow=\"visible\"][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=\"1_1\" background_position=\"left top\" background_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" border_color=\"\" border_style=\"solid\" spacing=\"yes\" background_image=\"\" background_repeat=\"no-repeat\" padding=\"\" margin_top=\"0px\" margin_bottom=\"0px\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_direction=\"left\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" center_content=\"no\" min_height=\"none\"][pause]  What does your data set look like?\" Actually, that's the reaction you'll get if whoever you're talking to is taking you seriously, so the reaction is a mixed blessing. On the one hand, you have their attention. On the other, they know enough to point out that projects without data go nowhere, and good data (not necessarily synonomous with big data) is hard to find. Data is truly the Moby Dick of the digital humanities. None is ever big enough, clean enough, or well-structured enough to achieve precisely what it is that researchers <em>would like</em> to achieve. Just when you (and more likely your team) feel confident that the data set is \"harpooned\" (structured, refined, aptly-tagged, and curated), the whale takes off again with a new standard: interoperabilty.  It doesn't play well with <em>other</em> data, and the chase begins again. When your data set works for you, that has some value, but when your data set works <em>with</em> others, well, that means a wider audience and a broader impact for your work.\n\nMost projects have lifespans determined by fellowships or grants or sabbaticals, and unlike Captain Ahab, we can't afford to have our hard work dragged out into the abyss and lost. The DH mantra may well be \"project or perish.\" Hard decisions about data are often determined by two factors: intellectual value and time. First, your data needs to be thoughtfully selected, described (tagged with metadata) and clean enough in order to work and to reasonably make the argument that what you've done with the data can be trusted. However, you need to know when it's time to cut the rope and release what <em>might</em> be done, a choice between good-enough and great. When just a few more hours of tagging, a few more weeks of correcting OCR errors seem just within your grasp, the choice feels mercinary. Deciding to stop improving your data, though, is like the difference between Faulkner and Melville: \"you must kill all your darlings.\" Data sets, really, are Modernist objects: they are \"what will suffice.\"\n\nThis is the lesson I learned during my first full month at MITH. As a Winnemore Dissertation Fellow, I have approximately four months to capitalize on MITH's resources and to produce a project that has a strong (but not perfect) data set, answers relevant humanities questions, and possesses enough sustainability, public outreach, and external support to become a viable, fundable project in the future. In these first five weeks, I have benefitted from the wealth of experience and depth of knowledge that the team assigned to my project possess. Jennifer Guiliano knows how to pull projects together, shepherding them through the steps of data management, publicity, and sustainability. Taking to heart her sage wisdom about managing successful DH projects, I feel that I have a much stronger grasp on what steps must be taken now and what can and must happen later, professional development knowledge that more graduate students should have when they venture into the alt-ac or tenure track market. Trevor Muñoz's expertise with data sustainability prompted questions that have helped shape a future to my project even at it's earliest outset—few graduate students have the time or the resources to think about how adequate curation in the short term could mean greater benefit in the long term. Amanda Visconti and Kristin Keister have been helping me to shape a public portal for my work, and I know that the virtual presence they help create will lend to the future success of the project, as well as its intellectual value.\n\nThe most salient lessons I've learned about the lure of the great data whale, however, have been from Travis Brown. I arrived in January with a large, but unrefined dataset of approximately 4,500 poems in a less-than-uniform collection of spreadsheets. I had a basic understanding of what I wanted the data to look like, but in consultation, Travis helped me to determine what would work better and might last longer. Travis created a data repository on MITH's space with a version control system called \"git.\" (Julie Meloni's often-cited and useful <a href=\"http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/a-gentle-introduction-to-version-control/23064\">\"Gentle Introduction to Version Control\"</a> on ProfHacker provides a useful explanation of what git is, why it's valuable, and where to find resources if you'd like to try it.) Once I installed <em>git</em> on my machine, replicated the repository, and \"pushed\" (basically moved the data from my computer into the repository Travis created) the data to it, Travis could take a look. We agreed to separate the text of the poems and their titles from the descriptive information about it (author, date, publication, etc.) and to use a uniform identification number to name the file for each poem, and to track its descriptive data in a separate spreadsheet. We realized at that point that there were some duplicates, and in conversation agreed that we would keep the duplicates (in case there was a reason for them, such as minor textual differences) and tag them, so that later we could come back to examine them, but in the meantime not include them in the tests I'd like to run.\n\nThen came the \"darling killing.\" Metadata, the information that describes the poetic texts that make up my data set, is necessary for the tests I'd like to run—those that classify and sort texts based on the likelihood that words co-appear in particular poems. The amount of metadata that I include to describe the poems will determine the kinds of tests and the reliability of the tests I hope to run. However, tagging 4,500 poems, even with simple identifiers, could take the whole four months of my fellowship if I let it. The hard choice was this: I would tag only the gender of the poet associated with each poem and whether or not the poem is ekphrastic (that is to say written about, to, or for work of visual art) or not or unknown. Some poems were easily tagged as ekphrastic, because I had sought them out specifically for that purpose; however, more often than not, I would need to make poem by poem determinations about the likely poetic subject. This takes time, and because of the tests I need to run to ask the questions I want to ask (eg. Can Mallet distinguish between descriptions of art and descriptions of nature?), I will need to let go of other useful, informative, helpful tags I would like to have, like the date each poem was published, the artwork to which it refers, and so on.\n\nI am keeping record of all these things. The decision <em>not </em>to be perfect is the right choice, but it isn't an easy one. I feel sometimes as though I have watched my whale slip from my grasp and sink back into the sea. My crew is safe. My project will continue on schedule, but not without the longing, nagging feeling that I need to return to this place again. Perfect data sets are a myth, one that often forms the barrier to new scholars who wish to begin DH projects. Rather than struggling for the perfect data set, I want to suggest that we place a much stronger emphasis on the more intellectual and more necessary component of data curation and data versions. I would argue that we judge projects not by the \"completeness\" or \"perfection\" of the data, but how well its versioning has been documented, how thoroughly curatorial decisions such as what to tag, when, and why have been publicized and described, and how much the evolution of the data contributes to the development of other projects within the community. Much the same way that we know more about the value of an article by how often it has been cited, we should value a digital humanities project by how much can be learned by the projects that follow it. In this sense, we should all be called Ishmael.\n\n<em>Lisa Rhody is a Ph.D. candidate in English at the University of Maryland, a Spring 2012 MITH Winnemore Dissertation Fellow, and a lecturer on the arts for the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts.

I'm happy to say that Carl has accepted a position with MITH as a Research Associate, through which MITH's fellows and grant projects will still be able to take advantage of his extraordinary talents as a conceptualizer of projects and a programmer. We hope to see him periodically throughout the year.",

    "wp post content": "<a href=\"http://www.blackgothamarchive.org/wp-content/uploads/C_PETERSON_fig_7.3.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\"><img class=\"aligncenter\" title=\"C_PETERSON_fig_7.3\" src=\"http://www.blackgothamarchive.org/wp-content/uploads/C_PETERSON_fig_7.3-313x500.jpg\" alt=\"Letter\" width=\"313\" height=\"500\" /></a>\n\nI found this note in the Harry A. Williamson Papers at the Schomburg Center while doing research for <em>Black Gotham</em>.  It’s a central document in my “cluster” on the New York City draft riots and uncovers a fascinating story.  The first part of the story relates to Williamson’s identity.  He turns out to be the grandson of Albro Lyons, the man to whom the note is addressed.  Williamson’s extensive collection testifies to his determination to preserve his family’s history; it includes genealogical records as well as a short memoir by one of Lyons’s daughters, Maritcha (and his aunt).\n\n\n\nAlthough I didn’t realize it at first, I soon discovered that the Lyonses are part of my family as well!  In combing through Williamson’s papers I found out that my great-great-grandfather Peter Guignon married one Rebecca Marshall in 1840, and that Albro married her sister Mary Joseph that same year.  That makes Albro my great-great-granduncle.  Many years later Philip White would marry Peter and Rebecca’s daughter, Elizabeth.\n\n\n\nSo this note has a particular emotional resonance for me.  It was sent by one Sergeant Rode to Albro on the last day of the draft riots.  The cause of the riots was the federal government’s passage of a draft law decreeing that all male citizens (by definition white) between the ages of 20 and 35 were to be enrolled in the military, and a lottery conducted to determine who would actually serve.  New York’s white working class was angered by what they perceived to be the unfairness of the law.  Political elites, who had decided on war, could buy their way out of the draft; African Americans, deemed to be the cause of the war, were excluded by law from service.  So on July 13, the mob, composed mainly of Irish men and women, took to the streets, wantonly attacking people and property, particularly in the black community.\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8608\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/black-gotham-image.jpg\" alt=\"View of Vandewater Street\" width=\"500\" height=\"313\" /></p>\n\nAlbro Lyons lived at 20 Vandewater Street.  The print above shows a typical Lower Manhattan street mixing buildings both residential and commercial, tall and low, frame and brick.  Maritcha had noted in her memoir that the family lived in a large brick building, so it could well have been one of those on the left side of the street.  It combined both the Lyons household and a Colored Sailors Home, and was also a stop on the Underground Railroad.  The mob stormed it three times.  When they had finished, this is what Maritcha had to say about the state of her home: “Its interior was dismantled, furniture was missing or broken.  From basement to attic evidences of the worst vandalism prevailed.  A fire, kindled in one of the upper rooms, was discovered in time to prevent a conflagration.”\n\n\n\nThe rioters’ goals in attacking Albro’s home were multiple but precise: they sought to strike at the heart of the black family; destroy black property and wealth, which they saw as ill gotten and undeserved; undermine black enterprises; prevent black sailors from seeking “white” work on the docks; and finally eliminate a black community institution dedicated to the abolitionist cause.\n\n\n\nWhat really caught my eye in the note, however, was the reference to “said drugstore.”   Could that have been the drugstore that Philip White had established in 1847 and would keep until his death in 1891?  Philip lived onVandewater Street only a few doors from the Lyonses.  Look again at the print.  If, instead of going up Vandewater you turned left onto Frankfort, at the very next corner you’d come to Philip’s pharmacy.  Like Lyons’s Sailors Home, it was an important landmark in the black community.  When visiting New York some years earlier, black Bostonian William C. Nell had praised Philip as a “practical man” who “conducted his business, preparing medicines, etc., etc., etc. with as much readiness and skill as any other disciple of Galen and Hippocrates.”\n\n\n\nHow could Philip’s drugstore have been a safe meeting place for a white police officer and a black victim gathering up his few remaining earthly possessions? Williamson gives us the answer in an account he preserved in his papers and must have provided to the <em>New York Times</em> at the time of Philip’s death.  According to the <em>Times</em> obituary:\n\n\n\n\"When the riot was at its height a crowd of men gathered at White’s store to defend it from attack.  Mr. White was warned by some of the business men that he would be wise if he hid himself.  He said: `What have I to fear?  Even if these men here could not protect me, there are as many men among the rioters who would fight for me as there are those who would injure me.’  Not the slightest attempt was made to harm him or his property.\"\n\n\n\nUnlike Albro, Philip had made himself indispensable to his local neighborhood.  As the <em>Times</em> obituary noted, he “was never unmindful of the poor, and the services and material of his store were willingly given without pay to any one who needed them.  .  .  .  Scores of poor families were befriended and helped by him not only with medicines, but with food and money.  Those whom he helped had a chance to show their gratitude during the draft riots of 1863.”\n\n\n\nPhilip had achieved a delicate balance in forging a mutually interdependent relationship between himself and his poor Irish neighbors.  By giving away medicines for free, Philip was helping to maintain the stability of the neighborhood in which he lived and worked, and protect his own position within it.  Accepting his benevolence over the years, his poor Irish neighbors were able to repay him by protecting him during the riots.  In so doing, they were also ensuring that the drugstore on which they depended so heavily would survive the riots and continue to serve them.\n\n\n\n<em>Carla L.

Bringing together researchers from the digital humanities and bioinformatics communities, the symposium will  explore ways in which these two communities might fruitfully collaborate on projects that bridge the humanities and medicine around the topics of sequence alignment and network analysis, two modes of analysis that intersect with “big data.” The workshop will be held April 10-12, 2012 in Washington, D.C. and College Park, MD.</p>\nFor more information including the call for attendees, please visit the <a href=\"http://www.mith.umd.edu/sharedhorizons/\">workshop website</a>.",

As previously reported, the group (participants listed in the early blog entry <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/mith-barn-raising-continues/\">here</a>) split into two teams:  one working to extend the tei-ann plugin for CKEditor (http://sourceforge.net/projects/teiann/) to allow for TEI-lite annotations, and one building an XML source editor with color coding and code suggestion.  The first team produced a preliminary stakeholders document which is currently being used by the designers of the original plugin to create a roadmap for future development.  The second team has produced a working prototype of their source editor, <em>Angles</em>, which can be tested <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20111121222306/http://mith.umd.edu/staff/dreside/RaiseXML/\">here</a> and downloaded from <a href=\"https://github.com/dougreside/RaiseXML\">here</a>.  At present none of the menu options (file, edit, help) on <em>Angles</em> have been activated, but typing an angle bracket (&lt;) in the text area will activate the autocomplete feature to suggest possible tags for that location.

This venture serves as my culminating capstone project for my master's degree in information science at the University of Texas at Austin's iSchool. Beyond my academic interests in archival theory and digital humanities and my personal passions for publishing and textual creativity, the immediate impetus for my capstone project was the desire of the UMD Libraries to create a digital scholarly edition of Katherine Anne Porter's correspondence, which is housed in Special Collections. Before they embark on assembling a large-scale edition of the letters, however, the Libraries hope to investigate the evolving genre that is the digital scholarly edition. In particular, they hope to delve into the question of how the \"data\" that comprise such an edition should be stewarded and integrated into an institution's digital holdings.\n\nThis is where I luck out: I get to help this stellar team pave the way for what I hope will be another small step forward in the evolution of the digital scholarly edition. I have begun the project by conducting a literature review in an attempt to determine the salient features of digital scholarly editions and to provide context for the University of Maryland's endeavors with Porter's letters. I am examining how emerging tools for annotation, online exhibition, and digital curation could be considered a new wave in archives' longstanding tradition of publishing manuscripts and how the archivist and librarian of the future might approach the stewardship of digital edition data.\n\nAn inspiring component of my work on the literature review thus far has been the opportunity to interview key players in the creation of digital editions: Andrew Jewell, Associate Professor of Digital Projects at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln Libraries, talked with me about constructing the Willa Cather Archive; Dorothy Porter, Associate Director for Digital Library Content &amp; Services at Indiana University, shared her wisdom about developing digital libraries; Amy Earhart, Assistant Professor of English at Texas A&amp;M University, reflected on the creation of the 19<sup>th</sup>-Century Concord Digital Archive; Doug Reside, Digital Curator of Performing Arts at the New York Public Library (and former MITH Associate Director) discussed the promises of recognition algorithms and the semantic web; and Gretchen Gueguen, Digital Archivist for Digital Curation Services at the University of Virginia (and former MITH Program Associate), emphasized the importance of preserving digital data for future use.\n\nMy research so far has underscored that there is a certain <em>fluidity</em> pervading scholarship and publication in the digital realm—a sense, as Tanya Clement phrases it in a journal article discussing her digital scholarly edition <em>In Transition</em>, of interactive \"textual performance,\" of live phenomena \"situated in space and time.\" This fluidity embodies the spirit of discovery made possible by digital publications, but this sense of uncertainty and suspense becomes all the more exquisite when contrasted with the solid framework on which successful digital scholarly editions are built: a framework that demands feasible levels of consistent textual encoding based on sustainable standards; an emphasis on data that has both significant thematic strength and great potential for re-use; a reliance on shared, interoperable infrastructure; an investment in peer review and robust user interface design; and a mindfulness throughout the processes of creation, curation, and preservation of an edition's fundamental purpose for its imagined audience—they are waiting in the digital reading room.\n\n<em>Wendy Hagenmaier is a 2012 Master's Candidate at the School of Information at the University of Texas at Austin.

The goal is to provide ‘small bites’ of each stage of digital work, from a survey of common theoretical and practical methodologies, to learning about project management, writing literature reviews and grant applications. By the end of the course, you will have the ability to scope, design, pitch, and participate in a digital project.</span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For students who are part of the </span><a href=\"http://dsah.umd.edu/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">DSAH</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> or are seeking a MITH Internship, this course will provide a strong foundation from which to approach the practicum requirement. </span>\n\n<h3><b>Module 1:</b> <b>Survey of common DH Methodologies</b></h3>\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><b>Tuesday January 2</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> (in-class meeting)\n\n</span><b>*Wednesday January 3 </b><b><i>is an in-class meeting</i></b></p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">This module will introduce common methodologies in the Digital Humanities, such as archives, text encoding, and spatial humanities. We will survey theoretical papers, practical examples, and common critiques to DH.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><b>Module 2: Project Management Part I (DH Workflows)</b></h3>\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><b>Thursday, January 4 </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(in-class meeting)\n\n</span><b>Monday, January 8 </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(online/team time)\n\n</span><b>Tuesday, January 9 </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(in-class meeting)</span></p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This module will introduce the fundamentals of digital project management and establishing your project's workflow, and methods for collaboration. We will discuss how to structure your project data, create a team charter, and use selected project management tools. Project proposals resulting from work in this module will articulate the purpose and approach of your project, while the team charter states how things such as shared credit will work across the project’s lifecycle.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><b>Module 3: Project Management Part II (Version Control)</b></h3>\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><b>Wednesday, January 10 </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(online/team time)</span></p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Digital work relies on collaboration and version control. Version control enables you to keep track of your many revisions, the various contributions to the project by team members, and repair mistakes. This module will introduce Git and GitHub as well as best practices for collaborating on a shared digital project.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><b>Module 4: Writing DH Literature Reviews and Environmental Scans</b></h3>\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><b>Thursday, January 11 </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(in-class meeting)</span></p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">DH research typically incorporates or creates digital resources; how should those be discussed and integrated into literature reviews for academic writing? In this module we will look at relevant examples, including journals focusing on the review of digital resources such as </span><a href=\"http://scholarlyediting.org\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Scholarly Editing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and </span><a href=\"https://www.americanquarterly.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">American Quarterly</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. You will also work on your own DH literature review for your final project.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><b>Module 5: Prototyping + Assessment</b></h3>\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><b>Tuesday, January 16 </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(in-class meeting)\n\n</span><b>Wednesday, January 17 </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(online/team time)</span></p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One challenge working with digital approaches is to anticipate the look and feel of the finished project. We will draw from design concepts and practices to produce many possible versions of a digital project, exposing the constraints and opportunities of each version. In this module, your team will produce paper and digital prototypes.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<h3><b>Module 6: Grants, Budgeting, Professional &amp; Social Networking</b></h3>\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><b>Thursday,  January 18 </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(in-class meeting)\n\n</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">*</span></i><b>Monday January 22</b><b><i> is an in-class meeting, presentations</i></b></p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In this module we’ll discuss how to talk about and persuade others to buy into your project by workshopping a quick elevator pitch, a conference presentation, and a grant proposal. We will cover how to think through the financial aspects of your project and create a project budget. Finally, we will discuss the social and political aspects of working within digital humanities communities of practice. We will cover alternative academic careers, building social networks, and modes of research.</span></p>",

    "wp post content": "In <a title=\"Infinite Ulysses: Designing a Public Humanities Conversation\" href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/infinite-ulysses-designing-public-humanities-conversation/\" target=\"_blank\">my previous post on this blog</a>, I introduced my dissertational <a href=\"http://dr.amandavisconti.com/\"><em>Infinite </em>Ulysses</a> project: a participatory digital edition that I've designed and coded for my uniquely shaped literature dissertation. I've now finished most of the work of building of the site. I've also finalized decisions around the online community experience such as writing statements on accessibility, inclusivity, and users' rights; explaining the research project that wraps the site; and clearly indicating how IP and copyright function for users of the site. I've now opened the digital edition to the very first beta-testers, and I'm inviting interested readers to sign up at <a href=\"http://www.infiniteulysses.com\">InfiniteUlysses.com</a> to join these first site users in a new conversation around <em>Ulysses</em>.\n\n\n\n[fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=\"yes\" overflow=\"visible\"][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=\"1_1\" background_position=\"left top\" background_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" border_color=\"\" border_style=\"solid\" spacing=\"yes\" background_image=\"\" background_repeat=\"no-repeat\" padding=\"\" margin_top=\"0px\" margin_bottom=\"0px\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_direction=\"left\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" center_content=\"no\" min_height=\"none\"][caption id=\"attachment_13480\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"472\"]<img class=\"wp-image-13480 \" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/frontpage-980x575.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the current front page of InfiniteUlysses.com\" width=\"472\" height=\"277\" /> The current front page of InfiniteUlysses.com.[/caption]\n\n\n\nThe site will eventually be open to everyone (with a planned public 1.0 release on the upcoming <em>Ulysses</em> holiday Bloomsday—June 16, 2015). Though during the final phase of my dissertational project this spring, I'm keeping a list of interested readers and slowly adding new users to the site from that list over the coming weeks.\n\n\n\nThis slow beginning will let me fix any really grievous bugs before there are too many users on the site. Adding testers slowly also lets me work more directly with each user as they join the site, gathering their feedback and discussing their user experience. I'm particularly interested in testing the site with people reading in groups, such as book clubs or teachers and their students; some additional site features coming at the end of this month will support group reading and help me test how the edition can support offline groups, and I'll be adding groups of users to the site at that time.

We’ll also schedule time for lightning talks. Some participants may seek to explore hands-on hacking of APIs following presentations; others may want to discuss ways that they could use an existing API. The workshop will include participants of varying skill levels and technical knowledge, and engage both developers and project managers. Once the participant list is finalized, we plan to kick-off a discussion online before the workshop so that we’re ready to make the best use of our afternoon unconference time.\n\nWe invite those interested in participating to apply for the workshop by January 14th. <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/apiworkshop/\" target=\"_blank\">mith.umd.edu/apiworkshop/apply/</a> Participants will be notified shortly after the deadline.

    "wp post content": "A MITH Digital Dialogue\r\r\nTuesday, April 17, 12:30-1:45\r\r\nMITH Conference Room, McKeldin Library B0135\r\r\n\r\r\nMITH's next Digital Dialogue features presentations by two of its current Fellows on their ongoing digital humanities research. Please come support local colleagues by hearing them talk about their projects.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe two presentations are ANGEL DAVID NIEVES (Architecture), \"Soweto '76, A Living Digital Archive\" and MERLE COLLINS (English and Comparative Literature), \"In the Footsteps of the Old Heads: Saraka and Nation in the Caribbean.\" Abstracts and bios follow.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Soweto '76, A Living Digital Archive\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThe aim of Soweto '76 is to develop an interactive immersive edutainment application and multimedia interface that allows users to experience a historically recreated urban environment with the support of primary and secondary archival materials. With the creation of a historically accurate environment as a platform, users will be able to assume the role of a character from the time period, and experience their reactions to actual events from their particular vantage point. It is hoped that users of Soweto '76 will act as virtual witnesses to the events of June 16, 1976--events that catalyzed the massive student uprisings against the apartheid regime. Using existing oral histories, testimonies, photographs, video footage, material objects, and sound recordings in the collections of the Hector Pieterson Museum, the work seeks to redress the uneven portrayal of the lives of Black township residents in the mainstream or \"official\"Ã‚Â historical record. Soweto '76 seeks to first address the absence of accounts from those students involved in the Uprisings (1) by making these multimedia texts accessible online and (2) by providing digital tools to facilitate a comparative analysis of the competing interpretations of key events. The site undertakes the challenges of collating the experiences (or \"collating the narratives\"Ã‚Â) and interpretive vantage points of the various historical and contemporary actors. The vantage point of the user changes as the various forms of multimedia data are accessed on the site. These \"collated narratives\"Ã‚Â will include both spatial and temporal representations of the events occurring on 16 June.\r\r\n\r\r\nANGEL DAVID NIEVES, B.Arch., M.A., Ph.D is currently an Assistant Professor in the School of Architecture, Planning, and Preservation at the University of Maryland, College Park. In Fall 2006 he began his new role as Director of Graduate Research and Training at the Consortium on Race, Gender, and Ethnicity (CRGE) and as a Resident Fellow at the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH). He is an affiliate faculty member in the Departments of American Studies, Women's Studies, African American Studies, and Anthropology. He is also an affiliate member of the Center for Heritage Resource Studies and the Program in LGBT Studies. He completed his doctoral work in architectural history and Africana studies at Cornell University in 2001. He was Assistant Professor of Black Studies, Women's Studies, and Geography in the Department of Ethnic Studies at the University of Colorado at Boulder from 2001-2003. His book manuscript, 'We Gave Our Hearts and Lives To It:' Black Women and Nation-Building in the New South, 1877-1968, is currently being revised for publication with Duke University Press. He is also the co-editor (w/Leslie Alexander) of a forthcoming volume, 'We Shall Independent Be:' African American Place-Making and the Struggle to Claim Space in the U.S., with the University Press of Colorado to be released in early 2008. His scholarly work and activism critically engages with issues of heritage preservation, gender, and nationalism at the intersections of race and the built environment in the Global South.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"In the Footsteps of the Old Heads: Saraka and Nation in the Caribbean\"\r\r\n\r\r\nThis project is an exploration of African survivals and re-creations in the Caribbean island of Grenada. Conceptualized as a multi-media project, the project aims to produce a video-recording of aspects of a harvest celebration known as the saraka, and, through research and interviews, to trace the origins of the saraka and its observation by those who feel a duty to continue it because they have inherited it from their ancestors, those whom they refer to as the \"old heads\"Ã‚Â. The project aims to use current cellphone technology to disseminate information regarding various elements of the saraka as one component of its interface.\r\r\n\r\r\nMERLE COLLINS, MITH Fellow 2006-07, teaches Caribbean Literature in the English Department. She has been published in several anthologies of both poetry and fiction. Her short story, \"Shadowboxing\"Ã‚Â, was published in the anthology Stories from Blue Latitudes: Caribbean Women Writers at Home and Abroad (Seal Press, 2005). Her publications include two novels, Angel (London: The Women's Press, 1987; Seattle: Seal Press, 1988) and The Colour of Forgetting (London: Virago Books, 1995), three poetry collections, Because the Dawn Breaks(London: Karia Press, 1985), Rotten Pomerack (London: Virago Books, 1990) and Lady in a Boat (Leeds: Peepal Tree Press, 2003). She has also published a short story collection, Rain Darling (London: The Women's Press, 1990). Her current project as a MITH Fellow, \"In the Footsteps of the Old Heads: Saraka and Nation in the Caribbean\" continues a theme started for a 1995 program researched for the BBC and entitled, \"From Africa to the Caribbean: A Journey of the Oral Tradition\"Ã‚Â. Merle Collins won a Guggenheim Fellowship for the 2003-2004 academic year.\r\r\n\r\r\nComing up @MITH, April 24: Please join us at the Human-Computer Interaction Lab for MITH project collaborator Stan Ruecker (University of Alberta), \"The Research Potential of Transferability,\" 12:30, 2460 A.V.

In this post, I'll describe how I went about user-testing the edition, and share some early statistics about the edition's use.\n\n\n\nOn April 4, 2015—about one month into the open beta—the site had 356 members. Site users other than me authored 159 annotations on the novel; combined with my 247 annotations, the total number of annotations on the novel was 406. 137 unique tags on annotations were in use, helping filter annotations to readers' interests and needs. Although the site had a fair number of visitors during the first weeks of the open beta, only a very few readers also added annotations to the site. There were two fairly active users on the site (adding 60 and 19 annotations), with 9 users authoring 5 or more annotations, 19 users authoring 2 or more annotations, and 27 site users authoring at least 1 annotation.\n\n\n\nI used a variety of tactics to understand the experience of the edition's users:\n\n<ol>\n\n\t<li>Informal (hallway testing, tweeted questions)</li>\n\n\t<li>Talk-aloud observation (single or paired)</li>\n\n\t<li>Participatory design (sketching ideal layouts)</li>\n\n\t<li>Site contact form feedback &amp; emailed feedback</li>\n\n\t<li>GitHub issue queue</li>\n\n\t<li>Open beta soft launch survey (March 5th, 16 participants from non-academic/non-DH backgrounds)</li>\n\n\t<li>Open beta survey responses (March 9-30, 16 participants, many from academic and/or DH backgrounds)</li>\n\n\t<li>Google Analytics</li>\n\n\t<li>Aggregated mapping (heatmaps, scrollmaps, clickmaps; e.g. the highlighting over the word \"Chrysostomos\" on the first page of the book was clicked 111 times between March 7-21)</li>\n\n\t<li>Drupal statistics on frequency and authorship of annotations</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n[/fusion_builder_column][fusion_builder_column type=\"1_1\" background_position=\"left top\" background_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" border_color=\"\" border_style=\"solid\" spacing=\"yes\" background_image=\"\" background_repeat=\"no-repeat\" padding=\"\" margin_top=\"0px\" margin_bottom=\"0px\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_direction=\"left\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" center_content=\"no\" min_height=\"none\"][caption id=\"attachment_13883\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"653\"]<img class=\"wp-image-13883 size-full\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/1.png\" alt=\"Charts showing number of visitors and geographic locations of InfiniteUlysses.com visitors\" width=\"653\" height=\"216\" /> Charts showing number of visitors and geographic locations of InfiniteUlysses.com visitors[/caption]\n\n\n\nI used Google Analytics to capture anonymous, aggregated data about the edition's user experience. Note that the following figures represent the period from January 1, 2015 through March 21. Only the front page of the site and \"about\" pages were accessible to anyone (except a small group of invited early beta-testers) until the beginning of the open public beta on March 9th, so <strong>most of the site activity described here comes from the two-week period from March 9th to the 21st, 2015</strong>, as you can see from the \"Visits\" timeline. I'm continuing to gather site analytic data as the site sees more readers and begins to be used in classrooms; the stats here can give us a sense of the first weeks of a new public and participatory humanities project.\n\n\n\nThe spike on March 9th in the \"Visits\" chart shows how initial open beta publicity brought hundreds of people the site (with 1,579 unique site visitors during this two-week period), but only a relatively small number of readers stayed to make repeated use of the site during the first two weeks of the open beta. Visitors were mostly from the United States (857), followed by Great Britain (162), Canada (85), Ireland (66), and Brazil (60), with smaller counts from other countries. I discussed the site via email with one reader in Korea, and I discussed the site's predecessor <em>UlyssesUlysses</em> via Twitter with a reader from Norway in the past.

In particular, Twitter was responsible for 487 site sessions and Facebook for 350. These numbers speak to the usefulness of social media for getting the word out about academic projects. The Facebook number is interesting in that I don't have an account on that site; my only publicity activities were on Twitter, my <a href=\"http://www.LiteratureGeek.com\" target=\"_blank\">LiteratureGeek.com</a> blog, the MITH blog (responsible for 42 sessions), and my older prototype UlyssesUlysses.com (45 sessions), but mentions of the project ended up on that network as well.\n\n\n\n[/fusion_builder_column][fusion_builder_column type=\"1_1\" background_position=\"left top\" background_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" border_color=\"\" border_style=\"solid\" spacing=\"yes\" background_image=\"\" background_repeat=\"no-repeat\" padding=\"\" margin_top=\"0px\" margin_bottom=\"0px\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_direction=\"left\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" center_content=\"no\" min_height=\"none\"][caption id=\"attachment_13881\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"350\"]<img class=\"wp-image-13881 size-full\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/3.png\" alt=\"chart showing number of site visitors by number of returning visits to the site.\" width=\"350\" height=\"338\" /> Chart showing number of site visitors by number of returning visits to the site.[/caption]\n\n\n\nNew visitors made up 88.3% of site users, with only 11.7% of users returning for a second or further visit. Unfortunately, the data doesn't capture what percent of non-return visitors were potential <em>Ulysses</em> readers who decided not to use the site, versus people interested in the project but not interested in reading <em>Ulysses</em> at the current time. The \"Number of visitors by number of returning visits\" chart shows how many sessions were from users who visited the site 1, 2, or more times (see the \"Count of Sessions\" column); we can see, for example, that 72 users returned to the site twice, and that 22 users each visited the site 5 separate times.\n\n\n\nFiltering the statistics to just the pages of the book lets us see where users were reading; \"Users on most popular book pages\" shows the number of times a page of the book was viewed (pageviews) and how many users saw that page (users; note one user might view a page multiple times). From the popularity of pages 3 (the first page of the print book were the novel begins, and correspondingly the first page of the book on the digital edition), 4, 5, and 6, we suspect that most visitors began the novel at the beginning. Pages 24 and 25 (the first and second pages of the second episode of the novel) were also popular; perhaps returning readers jumped to the second episode to see what a page would look like that hadn't been most people's first choice to read and annotate. \"Total time spent on most popular book pages\" shows the cumulative attention (in time spent on a page) from site users on book pages. Page 3 (the first page of the novel) shows a considerably higher time, probably not because of its difficulty as a reading page but because it was the first page many readers encountered, where they would still have been learning to use the site's features. \"Exit count from most popular book pages\" (above) shows for how many users a given book page was the last page they viewed before leaving the site. We see that page 3 was a point where many users left the site (though not necessarily after spending significant time reading and testing features on that page).\n\n\n\n[/fusion_builder_column][fusion_builder_column type=\"1_1\" background_position=\"left top\" background_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" border_color=\"\" border_style=\"solid\" spacing=\"yes\" background_image=\"\" background_repeat=\"no-repeat\" padding=\"\" margin_top=\"0px\" margin_bottom=\"0px\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_direction=\"left\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" center_content=\"no\" min_height=\"none\"][caption id=\"attachment_13880\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"793\"]<img class=\" wp-image-13880\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/UserFlowbySocialNetwork.png\" alt=\"Visualization showing the user flow on InfiniteUlysses.com (e.g. people who entered the site on x page went on to y and z pages)\" width=\"793\" height=\"412\" /> Visualization showing the user flow on InfiniteUlysses.com (e.g. people who entered the site on x page went on to y and z pages)[/caption]\n\n\n\nAdditional information such as user flows (the above image is an example) will help add nuance to these statistics; information from the other forms of user testing will also round out my understanding of user motivations and experiences on the site. All this information helps me know what features of the site are useful and should receive refinement (e.g. the sorting and filtering feature pictured below was often praised on user surveys) and which I should remove from the site or redesign (e.g. the old, buggy site tour was replaced by a slideshow, and user surveys indicated that the site interface was intuitive enough that they didn't seek a tour of the site). If you're interested in more statistics about edition testing or a more nuanced discussion of these statistics, I'll be sharing a white paper about the project in a few weeks which contains a discussion of these results.\n\n\n\n[/fusion_builder_column][fusion_builder_column type=\"1_1\" background_position=\"left top\" background_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" border_color=\"\" border_style=\"solid\" spacing=\"yes\" background_image=\"\" background_repeat=\"no-repeat\" padding=\"\" margin_top=\"0px\" margin_bottom=\"0px\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_direction=\"left\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" center_content=\"no\" min_height=\"none\"][caption id=\"attachment_13884\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"378\"]<img class=\"wp-image-13884 size-full\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/filterscurrent.png\" alt=\"The current filtering and sorting features on InfiniteUlysses.com\" width=\"378\" height=\"422\" /> The current filtering and sorting features on InfiniteUlysses.com[/caption]\n\n\n\n<em>Amanda Visconti is the 2014-2015 <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/community/fellowships/winnemore-fellows/\" target=\"_blank\">Winnemore Digital Dissertation Fellow</a> at MITH.</em>[/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]",

    "wp post content": "Reading the <em>New York Times</em> a few weeks back, I stumbled upon an article that made me think about the kind of research we are hoping to make possible through our efforts at <em>Foreign Literatures in America</em>. It was about the difficulties, blind-alleys, red-herrings, and utterly unbelievable coincidences that are now such a defining part of historical scholarship on the assassination of President Kennedy. The <em>Times</em> reproduced <a href=\"http://video.nytimes.com/video/2011/11/21/opinion/100000001183275/the-umbrella-man.html\" target=\"_blank\">a six minute film by Errol Morris</a> about the mystery of a man seen standing under an umbrella on the infamous “grassy knoll” that sunny day in Dallas. Much research and speculation went into discovering the meaning of “The Umbrella Man” before an explanation was finally discovered. Morris poses the question in his <em>Times</em><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/22/opinion/the-umbrella-man.html\" target=\"_blank\"> commentary on the film</a>: What is it about these small details in the historical record that lead \"not to <em>a</em> solution, but to the endless proliferation of <em>possible</em> solutions?\" As scholars, we are all on the scent of our own “Umbrella Man,” chasing down a seemingly endless stream of small details in an effort to come up with the <em>most</em> possible of all possible solutions. As a project, FLA is trying to make it easier for those of us chasing down the details about the arrival of foreign literature in America to find each and every morsel of this evidence. Further, we are trying to provide digital tools to make visible micro-patterns in these details that might not be apparent “to the naked eye.”\n\nErrol’s film is very much concerned with this difference between what is visible on the surface and what is only visible with the aid of microscopic investigations. Much of the film is an interview with JFK assassination investigator Josiah \"Tink\" Thompson. After Thompson first identified \"the umbrella man,\" theories about this man abounded. Thompson asked for the real umbrella man to step forward. When he did, Louie Steven Witt explained that he brought the umbrella with him that day as a reference to the umbrella carried by Neville Chamberlain and as a protest against the appeasement policies of Kennedy's father, Joseph Kennedy, during the Second World War. In the film, Thompson points out that this explanation is \"wacky enough it has to be true\" and that Witt’s existence should be a cautionary tale to all historians. The true story behind “the umbrella man” makes the point that \"you can never on your own think up all the non-sinister, perfectly valid explanations for that fact.\"\n\nAccording to Thompson, John Updike wrote about “the umbrella man\" in 1967. Updike’s argument is interesting*, but I prefer Thompson’s more colloquial phrasing: “In historical research, there may be a dimension similar to the quantum dimension in physical reality. If you put any event under a microscope, you will find a whole dimension of completely weird, incredible things going on. It's as if there is the macro-level of historical research, where things sort of obey natural laws, the usual things happen, and unusual things don't happen, and then there's this other level where everything is really weird.\" In a way, FLA is trying to make possible just this kind of research - the \"quantum dimension\" of historical research on the reception of foreign authors in America. We hope to find as much of the really weird stuff as we can.\n\n*<a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/backissues/2011/11/john-updike-jfk-assassination-the-umbrella-man.html\" target=\"_blank\">Updike wrote</a>:  “We wonder whether a genuine mystery is being concealed here or whether any similar scrutiny of a minute section of time and space would yield similar strangenesses—gaps, inconsistencies, warps, and bubbles in the surface of circumstance. Perhaps, as with the elements of matter, investigation passes a threshold of common sense and enters a sub-atomic realm where laws are mocked, where persons have the life-span of beta particles and the transparency of neutrinos, and where a rough kind of averaging out must substitute for absolute truth. The truth about those seconds in Dallas is especially elusive; the search for it seems to demonstrate how perilously empiricism verges on magic.”\n\n<em>Rebecca Borden is a Ph.D. candidate in the English Department at the University of Maryland.

    "wp post content": "I’ve just returned from a whirlwind ten days of DH conferences. If I only paid attention to my mode of residence during the trip, I’d call this post “DH via Dorm Rooms”, but what I really got out of the experience (besides some serious college deja vu!) was a useful overview of what’s going on in the world of digital editing tools.\n\n<strong>Omeka for Textual Scholars.</strong> The first stop was the <a href=\"http://textual.org\">Society for Textual Scholarship</a> (STS) conference in Austin, Texas, which while not purely a digital conference necessarily gravitated toward discussions of digital tools. I began the conference by teaching a workshop, “Zero to Archive in Sixty Seconds: An <a href=\"http://www.omeka.org\">Omeka</a> Workshop for Textual Scholars” (teaching tools from the workshop are available <a href=\"http://digitalliterature.net/workshops/sts12.html\">here</a>). Omeka is a powerful platform for creating digital museums--and if you’re interested in a non-traditional sort of digital literary edition, one that situates a text or texts in a rich discourse field of media related to its creation and reception, Omeka helps you realize a narrative out of an archive of interlinked media. There’s also growing work on plugins specific to creating a more traditional type of edition within Omeka, such as <a href=\"http://omeka.org/codex/Plugins/Scripto\">Scripto</a> (transcription crowdsourcing; <a href=\"http://scripto.org/omeka/\">demo site</a>), TEIDisplay plus <a href=\"http://omeka.org/codex/Plugins/SolrSearch\">SolrSearch</a> (displays TEI files and makes them phrase-searchable), and the <a href=\"http://dcl.slis.indiana.edu/teibp\">TEI Boilerplate</a> (another method of TEI display), all of which we explored during the workshop.\n\n<strong>Teaching “Thinking Like an Editor”.</strong> Later at STS, I led a panel of editors from varied disciplinary backgrounds (theater performance, education, religion, Arabic language and translation, and digital edition design) in talking about ways to expose more people to “think like an editor”. Starting from Gary Taylor’s suggestion that the function of the editor is to help people get near texts and thereby love these cultural artifacts, we had a lively discussion about practical classroom assignments and digital tools for making our editions more participatory. One example of editing pedagogy we explored was MITH’s recent mentoring of graduate students in Neil Fraistat’s <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/eng738T/\">Technoromanticism</a> course; by conceiving the <a href=\"http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/\">Shelley-Godwin Archive</a> as a teaching site, MITH was both able to bring students closer to a text they’d already come to care about (each student marked up ten pages of Mary Shelley’s <em>Frankenstein</em> manuscript with TEI) as well as teach some practical digital skills and workflows (captured in <a href=\"http://amandavisconti.github.com/markup-pedagogy/\">this documentation</a>). In addition to introducing students to “thinking like an editor” around texts to which they already have some emotional connection, we discussed tactics for bringing historical textual artifacts alive such as exploring marginalia for evidence of a writer’s habits and thinking, exposing students to the materiality of old texts, and using performance to teach making editing decisions.\n\n<strong>An Evolving Digital Editions Platform.</strong> After STS, the next stop was the <a href=\"http://www.dhsi.org\">Digital Humanities Summer Institute</a> (DHSI) in Victoria, British Columbia, where I took the Digital Editions course taught by <a href=\"http://matthuculak.com/\">Matt Huculak</a>. This course explored the evolving <a href=\"http://editingmodernism.ca/\">Editing Modernism in Canada</a> project platform <a href=\"http://modernistcommons.ca/\">Modernist Commons</a>, a tool that offered an interesting counterpoint to the edition options available with Omeka. Modernist Commons is being developed on <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20140119105838/http://islandora.ca/\">Islandora</a>, a hybrid of the <a href=\"http://drupal.org\">Drupal</a> CMS and the <a href=\"http://fedora-commons.org/\">Fedora Commons</a> repository system; to put it simply, it’s a WYSIWYG tool for creating complete digital editions. The platform includes an ingest and OCR transcription process, areas for both TEI and RDF markup, rectangular and polygonal image annotation, and a shared collection of entity information (i.e. so that naming and events marked in different editions point to the same idea). The tool supports a number of front-end layouts such as the Internet Archive viewer, which allows a book-like appearance with pages that flip as you read, and also allows for the inclusion of born-digital content such as editorial methodologies. EMiC Project Director <a href=\"http://sinisterplots.wordpress.com/\">Dean Irvine</a> described the goals for Modernist Commons as offering both a platform for enriching text meaningfully without necessarily requiring knowledge of TEI (e.g. using simple RDF relationship fields and image annotation) as well as, for more advanced users, a platform that is modular and allows for customization and mass production of a variety of editions. It was fascinating to play around with a tool that was still in development and discuss the choices actively shaping it with its developers.\n\n<strong>DHSI and DH</strong>. Beyond the Digital Editions course, DHSI was a powerful demonstration of just how many fascinating areas of knowledge the umbrella “Digital Humanities” covers. With seventeen courses covering everything from physical computing (e.g. 3d printers) to digital pedagogy to the pre-digital book, a common theme among attendees was how difficult it had been to decide on just one of those classes to take (in fact, many attendees come back year after year from across the country to take more of DHSI’s course offerings). I was also impressed with how much the Digital Humanities community benefits <em>socially</em> from its allegiance to new technologies. Since everyone is always a novice when working with evolving tools, there’s extra impetus to help one another learn and generally geek and rejoice in the sharing of new knowledge and skills.\n\nSTS and DHSI provided a lovely ten days of sharing knowledge about the future of digital editing, and I’m looking forward to repeating the DHSI experience at MITH in January, when we host the first <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/dhwi\">Digital Humanities Winter Institute</a>.\n\n<em>Amanda Visconti is Webmaster at MITH and a Ph.D. student in the University of Maryland Department of English, where she focuses on textual studies, digital humanities practice, and developing the look and function of digital literary tools.

    "wp post content": "<em>The following remarks are a slightly modified version of a presentation made by MITH Director, Neil Fraistat, for the TILTS Symposium Roundtable: “WHAT IS DIGITAL HUMANITIES?” In order to open conversation on this topic, Fraistat draws together quotations from some of the most recent statements on the subject and articulates a set of questions through which it might be thoughtfully explored.</em>\n\n<strong>THE QUESTION(S) OF DIGITAL HUMANITIES</strong>\n\nThe topic for our roundtable today, “What is Digital Humanities?,” is a question that has already been widely addressed in a virtual cascade of tweets, blogs, newspaper articles, conference sessions, and manifestoes, not to mention a few essays, <a href=\"http://mkirschenbaum.wordpress.com/2011/01/22/what-is-digital-humanities/\">the most recent and best of which is by my colleague Matt Kirschenbaum</a>.  Links to much of this commentary can be found at <a href=\"http://commons.gc.cuny.edu/wiki/index.php/Defining_the_Digital_Humanities\">CUNY COMMONS</a>. The intensity of interest in this question and the heated debates about it reflect the perceived high stakes of the answer. Two MLAs ago, Digital Humanities was proclaimed as “the next big thing” on the academic scene; this past MLA it was discussed in the Chronicle as not only already well established, but as having developed a “star system,” a sure sign of approaching superannuation.  Next year, I expect we’ll be hearing about “The Death of the Digital Humanities,” so it is probably best that I speak quickly before the whole subject completely disappears.\n\nAt an MLA session on “The History and Future of Digital Humanities” a few weeks ago, I found myself wanting to tell those in the room who were obsessing over exactly what Digital Humanities is to relax: I’m a Romanticist, and after over 150 years we still haven’t come to a generally agreed upon definition of the field--and that, oddly enough, has helped to keep Romanticism dynamic and vibrant. On the other hand, it has also made Romanticism as a field vulnerable to disappearing into the long 18th or 19<sup>th</sup> Centuries, which is to say that “fieldness” has very real material and institutional instantiations and consequences, as Kirschenbaum and others have argued.  These consequences are well illustrated by Kathleen Fitzpatrick in terms of the Media Studies Progam at Pomona College. Here is a long but very useful quotation from <a href=\"http://www.plannedobsolescence.net/blog/the-stakes-of-disciplinarity/\">\"The Stakes of Disciplinarity\"</a> on her blog <a href=\"http://www.plannedobsolescence.net/\">“Planned Obsolescence”</a>:\n\n\"[fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=\"yes\" overflow=\"visible\"][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=\"1_1\" background_position=\"left top\" background_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" border_color=\"\" border_style=\"solid\" spacing=\"yes\" background_image=\"\" background_repeat=\"no-repeat\" padding=\"\" margin_top=\"0px\" margin_bottom=\"0px\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_direction=\"left\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" center_content=\"no\" min_height=\"none\"][I]n order to be able to hire the person that media studies needed, in the subfields that we needed, working on the issues and with the methodologies we wanted our students exposed to, we had to become a department. We had to be able to control our own positions. We also needed our own space, rather than being spread out across the campus, and we needed a budget that could support the faculty that we were building. All of these pressures had the inevitable result of shoving us into a disciplinary model. In order to make the case for departmental status, I had to argue that media studies was a coherent field with a commonly agreed-upon set of core texts and methodologies. And it is, sure — but the thing about those core texts and methodologies is that they’ve got their origins in a range of other disciplines, which media studies has brought together in conversation around the idea of mediation. Over time, of course, those conversations have resulted in something that begins to look like a canon, and that process of canon-formation has, as it has repeatedly in fields across the academy, resulted in debates about what’s in and what’s out, who’s really doing media studies and who’s not.\"\n\nFitzpatrick concludes by wondering about the cost of “disciplinarity,” about “the degree to which we are now being disciplined by our need to define the field. What conversations won’t take place,” she asks,  “now that our structure has become officially institutionalized?” We DHers stand now at an intoxicating and relatively rare moment in the history of the humanities, at the cusp of what appears to be an emerging field that our own words and deeds can help to define; but Fitzpatrick’s cautionary note should bring necessary sobriety to our discussions about the exact meaning of Digital Humanities, since each of our attempts to discipline Digital Humanities risks losing whatever is most vital and promising about it. And yet such discussions as our own should and must go on.\n\nI’d like to help frame our discussion this morning by thinking about some of the most interesting questions that are presupposed by the question, “What is Digital Humanities,” the first among which would appear to be: “Is it a field?” Although some still consider DH to be an array of methodologies across the humanities disciplines rather than a field in its own right, most DHers appear to consider themselves to be engaged in a field with already well entrenched institutional roots. <a href=\"http://mkirschenbaum.wordpress.com/2011/01/13/the-dh-stars-come-out-in-la-2/#lyceum\">In the words of Steve Ramsey</a>: “Digital Humanities is not some airy Lyceum. It is a series of concrete instantiations involving money, students, funding agencies, big schools, little schools, programs, curricula, old guards, new guards, gatekeepers, and prestige. It might be more than these things, but it cannot not be these things.”\n\nThose who assume DH is a field face another set of subsidiary questions, among them:\n\n• What is its geneology?\n\n• What are its Boundaries?\n\n•Who is a Digital Humanist (and who is not)?\n\n•How does it change humanists' relationships to their tools and objects of study?\n\n•Who does its Labor?  How is this labor rewarded?\n\n• What is its Language?\n\n•What is its Curriculum?\n\n•What is its Value?\n\n•Has it Been Successful for the Right Reasons?\n\n•Is it Sustainable?\n\n•What is its Future?\n\nThese are some of the questions that I hope we’ll pursue in our joint discussion, for which I would like to prime the pump by making a few related observations. Of the questions I’ve named, the one about the boundaries of DH is perhaps the most contentious and has involved problematic oppositions between DH and new media studies, building and theorizing, method and ideology, service and research, “big tent DH” and disciplinary specialization. About such issues, I find especially interesting the following provocation by Mark Sample, with its call for innovation and disruption, though it might seem to fly in the face of thematerial realities I’ve already discussed:\n\nStop worrying about definitions and categories and celebrate hybridity. Take advantage of all that the margin affords. Do what you do and keep doing what you do. Engage outsiders, build coalitions, and form tactical collaborations. And move on when the time comes to move on, finding another periphery point to innovate and disrupt.\n\nSample’s tactics are founded on a compelling vision of the field as always not one, as it were--or to be more precise, that is always not one thing, but rather a dynamic process of thinking, making, and collaborating that is fundamentally concerned with disciplinary interrogation, innovation, and transformation.\n\nWhat DH has perhaps most lacked are compelling strategic visions of its own larger place and value both within and outside of the academy. As <a href=\"http://mkirschenbaum.wordpress.com/2011/01/13/the-dh-stars-come-out-in-la-2/#div-comment-52\">Johanna Drucker has recently noted</a>, the real challenge to digital humanities is still intellectual: how does work in this area contribute to theory, methods, or the corpus of humanistic study? This question goes right to the heart of ways we assess the value of tool-making, project development and management, institutional initiatives, programs. Humanities fields constitute themselves, like any discipline, through their theoretical approaches (ways of thinking), methods (ways of doing), and objects of study (pre-existing and constituted by the act of study). I do think we have instances of each of these in our legacy of digital humanities projects, but the explicit articulation of this – rather than blunt assertion – is not yet fully developed or we would not have to keep making the case.\n\n<a href=\"http://liu.english.ucsb.edu/where-is-cultural-criticism-in-the-digital-humanities/\">Alan Liu similarly laments the lack of cultural criticism in DH:</a>\n\nTo be an equal partner–-rather than . . . just a <em>servant</em>-–at the table, digital humanists will need to find ways to show that thinking critically about metadata, for instance, scales into thinking critically about the power, finance, and other governance protocols of the world.\n\nQuestions that might follow from Liu’s position include:\n\n•What are the politics of DH?\n\n•What kinds of ideological commitments does DH embody?\n\n•How does DH engage issues of Access, Openness, and Literacy?\n\n•How does DH engage issues of Diversity, Equity, and Globalism?\n\nIf Drucker and Liu are right about the intellectual work left to be done for the field, then for the purposes of our joint discussion this morning, we might take our cue from Chris Forster, who in a posting on the HASTAC blog last September that received much attention, suggests:\n\n[I]nstead of asking \"What is 'digital humanities'?\" we might ask, with greater profit (or maybe, simply, greater honesty): 'What does the digital humanities want?' or 'What do you want from the digital humanities?' or 'Why do you wish to make the humanities digital?'”\n\nAddressing such questions thoughtfully and compellingly is, perhaps, our best hope of securing the future of digital humanities. But, to my mind, the vitality of that future depends on our not foreclosing our definition and leaving the question of digital humanities just that.[/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]",

    "wp post content": "What I envision is parallel transcriptions of all witnesses to the text of the Mishnah (including citations in the Talmuds and the commentaries, although I have not encoded any of these yet). These transcriptions and their markup (they will be TEI compliant) will pay greater attention to the mss. as artifacts than raw transcriptions of text, so that the data encoded could, in theory, be used by scholars interested in scribal practice or orthography. I have taken chapter 2 of Bava Metsia as my sample text, and encoded several witnesses with the help of some students. These are all viewable at <a href=\"http://bit.ly/uCG10o\" target=\"_blank\">http://bit.ly/uCG10o</a>.\nAn example of \"raw\" markup (where significant data is encoded rather than marked graphically) is:\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://sites.google.com/site/digitalmishnah/files/bm_ch2_kauf_noCSS.xml\">bm_ch2_kauf_noCSS.xml</a><ins datetime=\"2011-12-23T15:14:14+00:00\">.</ins></li>\n</ul>\nExamples of encoded texts subsequently processed to be viewed, e.g., opposite a facsimile include:\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://sites.google.com/site/digitalmishnah/files/BM_Ch2_Kauf-flat-pages-html.html\">BM_Ch2_Kauf-flat-pages-html.html</a> (a version of the same file)</li>\n\t<li><a href=\"http://sites.google.com/site/digitalmishnah/files/g1-flat-pages-html.html\">g1-flat-pages-html.html</a> (an genizah fragment)</li>\n</ul>\nFrom those parallel transcriptions it should be possible to generate detailed comparisons of all witnesses or of select witnesses, without at the outset privileging any one witness. Thus, for instance, <a href=\"http://www.digitalmishnah.org/project-pages/examples/\">sampleparallelcolumns.html</a> was generated through a proof of concept for how a synoptic edition might be constructed. Using the same processing method, one could select witnesses that one was interested in for some reason (all German hands, all Genizah fragments). But for some purposes a word by word collation or text with <em>apparatus criticus</em> is the preferred output. For this, we are provisionally working with EU-sponsored software called CollateX (still under development). One sample of output from CollateX, in the form of an alignment table, using texts of the Mishnah is at <a href=\"http://sites.google.com/site/digitalmishnah/files/g1-flat-pages-html.html\">CollatexOutput.html</a>. Although there are errors, the output is surprisingly good, especially since some of the errors have to do with \"tokenization,\" i.e., breaking the texts into individual units for collation, and are thus generated by me not CollateX.\nWhat's next?\n<ul>\n\t<li>Continuing to modify exiting files to match newly developing schema</li>\n\t<li>Modify sample output through XSLT to show possibility of text and apparatus.</li>\n</ul>\n<em>editor's note</em>: Hayim Lapin is Robert H.

THATCamp Games brought together members of the games industry, games researchers and designers, and games teachers to discuss games in as many genres (e.g. board games, alternate reality games, video games) and areas (e.g. games for teaching writing, game programming, and historical gaming) as possible. Almost one hundred people attended, coming from both the local DC/MD area and states across the country: Washington, California, New York, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Michigan, to name a few. Our first event was one of the first screenings of Lorien Green’s new documentary <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180609170848/http://boardgamemovie.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Going Cardboard</em></a>, a documentary about the players and designers in the burgeoning eurogaming scene; after the film showing, Green answered questions via Skype. Friday offered a full day of <a href=\"http://thatcampgames.org/bootcamps/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fifteen workshops</a> (\"Bootcamps\") divided into three tracks: beginner-friendly introductions to game design (e.g. a “my first board game” prototyping session), a “hack track” for people with some previous game coding experience (e.g. HTML5, Inform 7, and the Kinect), and a track devoted to games in the classroom (e.g. alternate reality games and video games in the classroom). After the workshops, we headed over to MITH (<a href=\"http://ow.ly/i/qiU7\">avoiding the grue</a>) for a reception.\n\n<img class=\"alignright wp-image-8648\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/thatcamp-games_twohappyorganizers-550x272.jpg\" alt=\"THATCamp Games Organizers\" width=\"309\" height=\"153\" />Saturday started off menacingly: an overnight snowstorm left sheets of black ice between attendees and the conference. Most of the attendees and all of the coffee managed to make it to the conference building on time, however, and we cast our votes to narrow down almost forty attendee-proposed sessions to fit into five time slots in five rooms. (If you’re not familiar with <a href=\"http://thatcamp.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">THATCamps</a>, attendees don’t present papers but instead write blog posts about topics they’d like to discuss, then facilitate sessions on those topics). You can see which sessions got placed on the schedule <a href=\"http://thatcampgames.org/fullchedule/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>; these included discussions on <a href=\"http://thatcampgames.org/2012/01/03/session-proposal-quest-based-evaluation-schemes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">quest-based evaluation schemes</a>, teaching <a href=\"http://thatcampgames.org/2012/01/20/session-proposal-games-and-the-literature-classroom/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">games in the literature classroom</a>, and <a href=\"http://thatcampgames.org/2012/01/03/a-modest-session-proposal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">course game design using learning management systems</a>. We ran a game lounge all-day on Saturday, but since most attendees were busy with sessions then, we also met for game-playing and a Glorious-Trainwrecks-style rapid-prototyping game design jam on Sunday morning. If you weren’t following the overwhelming volume of “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23thatcamp%20games\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">#thatcamp games</a>” tweets last weekend, we’re happy to report that the event satisfied both unconference novices and THATCamp veterans, with assessments such as “a truly intellectually (and personally) meaningful event” and “THATCamp Games: totally awesome.\" Amidst the sessions, we ran an unconference-long alternate reality game, participated as a group in a spoken text adventure, logged onto an attendee-run Minecraft server, and thought really hard about the puzzle on the backs of the conference shirts.

The two-year $590,000 award under NDIIPP's Preserving Creative America program will be shared among the project participants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe researchers leading the work at the University of Maryland are <strong>NEIL FRAISTAT</strong> (Professor of English and Director, MITH), <strong>MATTHEW KIRSCHENBAUM</strong> (Associate Professor of English and Associate Director, MITH), and <strong>KARI KRAUS</strong> (Assistant Professor, College of Information Studies and English).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Preserving Virtual Worlds project will explore methods for preserving digital games, interactive fiction, and shared realtime virtual spaces. Major activities will include developing basic standards for metadata and content representation and conducting a series of archiving case studies for early video games and electronic literature, as well as Second Life, the popular and influential multi-user online world. According to Fraistat, \"This award from the Library of Congress places MITH and its partners at the forefront of those addressing a range of increasingly urgent questions involving the preservation of creative works that are \"born digital\"--from interactive electronic literature, to digital games, to virtual worlds such as Second Life. We are especially pleased to have as an industry partner, Linden Lab, the creator of Second Life itself.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to contributing to the work on Second Life, Maryland will take the lead on interactive fiction/electronic literature as a sub-domain of the project, and will be occupied with all aspects of scoping, metadata, intellectual property, evaluation, and archiving of these materials. We will initially focus on a small number of targeted works of recognized cultural and literary significance, including former Poet Laureate Robert Pinsky's 1984 interactive novel Mindwheel, Will Crowther's ADVENTURE (written in 1975 and widely considered the earliest interactive text of its kind), and selected items from a large private collection of 1980s-era hardware and software recently gifted to MITH. The international Electronic Literature Organization will also extend its support and in kind contributions to our work here at Maryland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project begins in January 2008.

The gestural characteristics of the speakers from different regions, while unique to the speaker, are also unique to the culture of the region and help the researcher to acquire the sounds intrinsic to that dialect or accent by the formation of the lips and use of the vocal and articulatory musculature. As a crowd-sourced website, or \"wiki\", the Visual Accent Dialect Archive has the potential to attract dialect and accent donations from all over the world. Donors may speak a story, or a list of words, or a paragraph. Once the VADA website is populated, researchers can click on a specific region, country, or state and locate the specific dialect or accent. In addition to being a central resource for performers, the website provides excellent cultural information for anthropologists and linguists.\n\n\n\nThis talk will be held in the MITH Conference Room, in the basement of McKeldin Library.\n\n\n\nLeigh Wilson Smiley is a professional actor and expert on voice, accents, and dialects.  She is the Associate Director of Theatre, and the Head of the MFA in Performance Program in the School of Theatre, Dance, and Performance Studies at the University of Maryland College Park.  With the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities Leigh created the first website to focus on both the visual as well as the auditory characteristics of accent and dialect called <em>The Visual Accent &amp; Dialect Archive</em> (acronym VADA).  Amongst the companies with whom Leigh consults are: Shakespeare &amp; Company in Lenox, Massachusetts; Ford's Theatre; Folger Shakespeare Theatre; Signature Theatre; Pig Iron Theatre; Cirque de Soliel; and NBC Washington.\n\n\n\nA continuously updated schedule of talks is also available on the Digital Dialogues webpage.\n\n\n\nUnable to attend the events in person?\n\n\n\nArchived podcasts can be found on the MITH website, and you can follow our Digital Dialogues Twitter account @digdialog as well as the Twitter hashtag #mithdd to keep up with live tweets from our sessions.\n\n\n\nAll talks free and open to the public.

    "wp post content": "The following was submitted to the Senate Appropriations Committee by MITH Associate Director Matthew Kirschenbaum.  This was in response to an invited opportunity for researchers and innovators to give testimony for an April 29, 2014 hearing on how federal research dollars can help drive innovation.\n<h4 style=\"text-align:center\">Public Witness Testimony</h4>\n<h1 style=\"margin-bottom: 0.5em;text-align:center\">Submitted to the Senate Appropriations Committee</h1>\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\">Digital Humanities Innovation from NEH Funding</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>Matthew G. Kirschenbaum, Associate Professor of English and Associate Director, Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH), University of Maryland</em></p>\n<br />\nAs a scholar and researcher in the new and emerging field of Digital Humanities, it is my pleasure to offer remarks in support of the role federal funding plays in this work at the University of Maryland College Park, specifically the Office of Digital Humanities in the National Endowment for the Humanities.\n\nDigital Humanities involves the application of computational tools and techniques to large bodies of digital material (so-called \"Big Data\") drawn from the cultural heritage sector. Examples include textual corpora containing literally millions of books, large-scale image collections digitized by museums, and collections of audio recordings. Digital humanities also involves innovation in new forms of scholarly communication, including social media; and new forms of publication and analysis, such as visualization, GIS mapping, and 3-D animation or reconstruction. Crucially, Digital Humanities emphasizes public and outward facing access, with open Web resources being the most typical form of disseminating this work. Training in Digital Humanities tools and techniques, meanwhile, is helping revitalize undergraduate and graduate education in the humanities at moment when the public at large increasingly sees the humanities as at best secondary pursuits alongside supposedly more pragmatic STEM fields.\n\nAt the University of Maryland, we have enjoyed the benefit of funding from several federal agencies in this work, including the Institute for Museum and Library Services, the Library of Congress, and the National Science Foundation. However the National Endowment for the Humanities is unquestionably the single most important federal funding source for Digital Humanities research. Since 2009 alone, MITH at Maryland has been the beneficiary of over a dozen NEH grants, the majority from the Office of Digital Humanities, ranging in value from roughly $25,000 to $400,000 and totaling approximately $1.26 million. These have supported projects from (at the low end) \"Enhancing Music Notation Accessibility\" and \"Data, Biomedicine, and the Digital Humanities\" to (at the high end) \"Building an Accessible Future for the Humanities\" and \"The Text-Image Linking Environment,\" as well as the \"Shelley-Godwin Archive.\" This last project is representative of Digital Humanities work: on a free and publicly accessible Web site (http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/) it makes available all of the notebook and manuscript materials involved in the composition of the classic novel Frankenstein by Mary Shelley. Members of the public can follow the composition of the novel line by line as Mary worked with her equally famous husband, the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, to edit and revise the manuscript; the site also allows the public to participate in transcribing the manuscript materials themselves, subject to the oversight of the expert editorial team. A formerly cloistered scholarly activity, restricted to those with privileged access to reading rooms and special collections, has been opened to anyone with the interest and an internet connection.\n\nThe remainder of this testimony will describe how an extremely modest initial investment on the part of the NEH (under $12,000, one of the smallest grants the agency has ever awarded) has led to substantial ongoing innovation. The project was entitled \"Approaches to Managing and Collecting Born-Digital Literary Materials for Scholarly Use.\"\n\nToday nearly all published poetry, fiction, and drama is born-digital in the sense that the text is composed with a word processor, saved on a hard drive (or other computer storage media), and accessed as part of a computer operating system. True, some writers will still employ longhand or even mechanical typewriters as a step in their composition process, but sooner or later the text will be keyed into a computer, almost always to be further revised. Often the text is emailed to an editor, along with other correspondence. Editors edit electronically, inserting suggestions and revisions and emailing the file back to the author for approval. Publishers use electronic typesetting and layout tools, and only at the very end of this process is the electronic text of the manuscript (by now the object of countless transmissions and transformations) produced as the static material artifact that is a printed book. This new technological fact about writing is already having an impact, from office work to government and the academy to literature and the creative arts. President Obama’s use of a Blackberry and the implications for the Presidential Records Act is a high-profile example of how the public is coming to terms with the consequences of born-digital authorship. In the particular realm of literature and literary scholarship, this means that writers working today will not and cannot be studied in the future in the same way as writers of the past, since the basic material evidence of their authorial activity—manuscripts and drafts, working notes, correspondence, journals—is, like all textual production, increasingly migrating to the electronic realm.\n\nMeanwhile, librarians and archivists have not failed to take note as computer storage media, as well as entire computers, have begun arriving on their doorstep as an increasingly routine part of the acquisition of an author’s \"papers.\" Notable authors represented with at least some born-digital material include John Updike, David Foster Wallace, Russell Banks, Samuel Beckett, Lee Blessing, John Crowley, Robert De Niro, Michael Joyce, Thomas Kinsella, Bernard Kops, Norman Mailer, Terrence McNally, Tim O’Brien, Salman Rushdie, Ronald Sukenick, Leon Uris, Alice Walker, and Arnold Wesker.\n\nTo date, however, the activity associated with processing such born-digital material has been localized and idiosyncratic, and, at least in the US, without much cross-communication among the different archives and repositories involved; moreover, the archives and repositories, for their part, have not yet addressed these challenges with the scholars who will seek to access born-digital literary material in the years to come. Literary scholars are going to need to play a role in decisions about what kind of data survives and in what form, much as bibliographers and editors have long been advocates in traditional libraries settings, where they have opposed policies that tamper with bindings, dust jackets, and other important kinds of material evidence. This grant therefore brought together scholars, archivists, digital curators, and technical personnel associated with three significant born-digital collections for a series of targeted site visits and planning meetings at each of their respective institutions, with the goal of working towards a larger project proposal designed to address the needs of both archivists and scholars in this new milieu.\n\nDigital Humanities Level 1 Start-Up funding ($11,708) was received in support of a series of site visits and planning meetings for personnel working with the born-digital components of three significant collections of literary material: the Salman Rushdie papers at Emory University’s Manuscripts, Archives, and Rare Books Library (MARBL), the Michael Joyce Papers (and other collections) at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at The University of Texas at Austin, and the Deena Larsen Collection at the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) at the University of Maryland. The meetings and site visits were undertaken with the two-fold objective of exchanging knowledge amongst the still relatively small community of practitioners engaged in such efforts, and facilitating the preparation of a larger collaborative project proposal aimed at preserving and accessing the born-digital documents and records of contemporary authorship.\n\nWhile there have been numerous studies of the impact of computerization on composition, these often present the computer as simply another tool or instrument. In fact, a computer functions much more like an environment—or a writing space, to use a term popularized by Jay David Bolter. Access to an entire computer is not unlike having a key to an author’s study or workroom. On the one hand, this creates an awesome burden of responsibility for the archivist, since all manner of sensitive personal information can be inappropriately exposed. Sometimes donors will make their wishes explicit in this regard; but what if they don’t? Should a researcher be allowed to see an author’s choice of desktop wallpaper? After all, scholars have traditionally been interested in the physical setting in which an author worked, even to the level of such details as furnishings, decorations, and, yes, wallpaper. Other examples begin to enter into the realm of forensic information recovery. A computer’s registry, for example, stores information related to all of the device drivers and application software in the operating system; its value as a record of the digital environment of the computer is enormous. At the level of individual works, scholars will surely want to examine a file’s properties, which contain records of when it was last opened and closed and how many hours and minutes was spent accessing it. This kind of metadata, while hardly infallible—it could be spoofed by something as simple as an incorrect system clock—could, with care, be used to establish chronologies that could date the composition of a work—or specific passages within a work—to the hour, minute, and second.\n\nLikewise, various word processing packages incorporate \"track changes\" features which preserve a record of a document’s internal edits, as well as marginal commentary. Track Changes is already a widely used editorial tool, and can systematically capture the kind of revision history for a document that had heretofore been available only incidentally. Given the ease with which multiple versions and drafts can be saved—often this occurs automatically as a function of the software—it is not hard to imagine a scenario in which a scholar may potentially have access to hundreds or even thousands of versions of the same work, and be faced with the prospect of discovering what significant differences between them actually exist. Here we may see textual scholarship begin to draw heavily on text mining and visualization, methods which are specifically aimed at sorting and sifting large volumes of data. For example, a scholar might use a combination of data mining and visualization to discover \"hot spots\" in the evolution of a work, points at which especially significant revision activity took place.\n\nThe meetings and site visits supported by NEH led to the production of a extended white paper which has been downloaded many thousands times and is routinely cited in the emerging professional literature on the archival processing of born-digital literary and cultural materials. This extremely modest investment by the NEH has also led to additional funded research, notably an effort to develop digital forensics tools for archivists so as to begin actually addressing the concerns articulated in the white paper.\n\nDigital forensics is an applied field originating in law enforcement, computer security, and national defense. It is concerned with discovering, authenticating, and analyzing data in digital formats to the standard of admissibility in a legal setting. While its purview was once narrow and specialized (catching black hat hackers or white collar \"cybercriminals\"), the increasing ubiquity of computers and electronic devices means digital forensics is now employed in a wide variety of cases and circumstances. The floppy disk used to pinpoint the identity of the \"BTK Killer\" and the GPS device carried by the Washington DC sniper duo—both of which yielded critical trial evidence—are two high-profile examples. Digital forensics is also now routinely employed in counter-terrorism and military intelligence.\n\nBut the same forensics software that indexes a criminal suspect’s hard drive allows the archivist to prepare a comprehensive manifest of the electronic files a donor has turned over for accession; the same hardware that allows the forensics investigator to create an algorithmically authenticated \"image\" of a file system allows the archivist to ensure the integrity of digital content once captured from its source media; the same data recovery procedures that allow the specialist to discover, recover, and present as trial evidence an \"erased\" file may allow a scholar to reconstruct a lost or inadvertently deleted version of an electronic manuscript—and do so with enough confidence to stake reputation and career.\n\nBased in part on the successful work done in the NEH project, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation has provided extensive funding for the University of Maryland’s participation in the BitCurator project. The BitCurator project began on October 1, 2011.  It is a joint effort with the School of Information and Library Science at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (SILS) and Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities to develop a system for that incorporates the functionality of many existing open source digital forensics tools. The BitCurator project is thus an effort to build, test, and analyze systems and software for incorporating digital forensics methods into the workflows of a variety of libraries, museums, and archival institutions. BitCurator currently enjoys extensive uptake in the practitioner community, and is allowing both archivists and scholars to take active steps toward the preservation of born-digital cultural heritage. The early and prescient support from the Office of Digital Humanities at the National Endowment for the Humanities significantly contributed to the articulation of community goals that this research is now answering.\n\n<b>Reference URLS</b>\n\n<a href=\"https://securegrants.neh.gov/publicquery/main.aspx?f=1&amp;gn=HD-50346-08\" target=\"_blank\">Approaches to Managing and Collecting Born-Digital Literary Materials for Scholarly Use</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://www.bitcurator.net/\" target=\"_blank\">The BitCurator Project</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/\">The Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities</a>",

Though natural history collections are meant to last for generations, the records they contain last only years (at best) without careful maintenance and curation. Digital collections are particularly fragile, prone to bit rot and obsolescence, and must consequently be upgraded and migrated frequently. In this talk, Thomer will consider the temporal rhythms of natural history data collections, their management, and and their migration, and how that impacts the creation and management of systems of understanding – and making – “deep time.”\n\n\n\n<em>Andrea Thomer is an assistant professor of information at the University of Michigan School of Information. She conducts research in the areas of data curation, museum informatics, earth science and biodiversity informatics, information organization, and computer supported cooperative work.  She is especially interested in how people use and create data and metadata standards; the impact of information organization on information use; issues of data provenance, reproducibility, and integration; and long-term data curation and infrastructure sustainability -- on the scale of decades rather than years.  She is studying a number of these issues through the \"Migrating Research Data Collections\" project - a recently awarded Laura Bush 21st Century Librarianship Early Career Research Grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services. Dr. Thomer received her doctorate in Library and Information Science from the School of Information Sciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana‐Champaign in 2017.</em>",

    "wp post content": "MITH is delighted to welcome Heather Froehlich of the University of Strathclyde (Glasgow, UK) for an lecture entitled \"To any count, to all counts, to what is man\": finding patterns of gender in Early Modern\"  on July 2nd at 3 pm in MITH's Conference Room. The statistical computation of possible collocates creates a distance view of the Shakespeare corpus as a whole. To produce a close reading of these examples in context, she uses various digital tools including WordHoard, AntConc, Open Source Shakespeare, the Oxford English Dictionary and Historical Thesaurus of the OED to create a cross-section of gender. In this paper, she selects highly prototypically gendered nouns which illustrate high, neutral, and low formality: lord/lady, man/woman, knave/wench. These specific nouns have been culled from both intuition and representative collocational patterns in Shakespeare while remaining illustrative of highly prototypical titles and social roles relevant to the early modern period. She aims to identify some salient patterns of gender representation across a model corpus of Early Modern Drama by highlighting a number of collocational patterns which construct both gender and formality in the Shakespeare corpus. She hypothesizes that formality levels will be consistently represented in relationship to female characters rather than male characters, but from this process she ultimately suggest that a formality distinction is closely tied to femininity, rather than masculinity, in Shakespeare. Please join us for her talk.",

Authors create patterns, use collage, make links, sample media during the creative process, and readers are faced with the task of responding to a set of textual circumstances. While illustrating and introducing the basic mechanics of digital poetry, this presentation engages with works as if moves in a game of Scrabble, suggesting how expression can be further propelled using digital and analog media. Beyond the role of influence and inspiration, the output and data presented in digital poems can often be seen and used as a basis for myriad sorts of projective, progenerative language, image, or sound, which can be combined and recombined in so many variations. If literature is to be interactive, we must cultivate ways to respond to what is given, and in the process may find ourselves able to remediate materials in order to build something original.\r\r\n\r\r\nPoet and scholar CHRIS FUNKHOUSER is an Associate Professor in the Humanities Department at New Jersey Institute of Technology. In 2006 he was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship to lecture and conduct research in Malaysia, where his CD-ROM eBook Selections 2.0 was produced at Multimedia University in Cyberjaya. Prehistoric Digital Poetry: An Archaeology of Forms, 1959-1995, a history of pre-WWW computerized poetry, has just been published in the Modern and Contemporary Poetics series at University of Alabama Press. In 2008, a bi-lingual collection of his technology writings, Technopoetry Rising: Essays and Works, will be published in SÃƒÂƒÃ‚Â£o Paulo (Musa Editora). He was on the Summer Writing Program Faculty at Naropa University earlier this year, where he co-edited a volume of We Magazine focused on Creative Cannibalism (http://www.wepress.org/19).

    "wp post content": "In 2007, MITH acquired the <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/larsen/\" target=\"_blank\">Deena Larsen Collection</a> (DLC). The collection consists of Macintosh SE computers, archived press materials, and early hypertexts and electronic literature from 1987 to 2004. I recently had the fortunate opportunity to sit down with Deena and fellow hypertext author, Bill Bly.\n\n<em>How did you both become involved in hypertext literature?</em>\n<strong>Bill Bly</strong>: I had gotten a Mac in 1988, and loved it. Five years later, I learned about Storyspace, a Mac program distributed by Eastgate Systems, that let you write hypertext -- a novel that could be read more than one way. Mark Bernstein, Chief Scientist of Eastgate, sent me a copy of the program, and after a lot of experimentation and help from other writers of hypertext, I finished my own hypertext novel, <em>We Descend</em> -- oddly enough, a story about an archive.\n\n<a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DLC_deena.jpg\"><img title=\"Deena_Larsen_Bill_Bly_052011\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DLC_deena.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"410\" /></a>\n\n<strong>Deena Larsen</strong>: I started out with a vision of a work that told the story mostly in the links: <em>Marble Springs</em>. Then I got interested in the form and function of hypertext literature. There were scattered folks, and we attached ourselves to the hypertext community because we didn't have one of our own. The Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) hypertext group was primarily science-based; we created a community of hypertext writers through these [fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=\"yes\" overflow=\"visible\"][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=\"1_1\" background_position=\"left top\" background_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" border_color=\"\" border_style=\"solid\" spacing=\"yes\" background_image=\"\" background_repeat=\"no-repeat\" padding=\"\" margin_top=\"0px\" margin_bottom=\"0px\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_direction=\"left\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" center_content=\"no\" min_height=\"none\"][ACM] conferences.\n\n<em>What are the advantages of the hypertext form?</em>\n\n<strong>BB</strong>: The web is hypertext, but very, very simple in terms of what it can do with links. For example, on the web you can only send out one link from each anchor. In Storyspace, the older [hypertext] program, you can have multiple links from the same anchor, making for a much richer structure.\n\n<strong>DL</strong>: First there was text. Now all of a sudden you can make text dance; there are links, sounds, images, much more than the spoken word. We get to explore. We get to explain. It's like going from walking to an airplane. You see all of the paths, all of the roads, which nodes are more important, the complete landscape.\n\n<a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DLC_map.jpg\"><img title=\"We_Descend_Bill_Bly\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DLC_map.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"410\" /></a>\n\n<em>How do you create a cohesive narrative plot in the hypertext if a reader may take multiple paths through the text at any given time?</em>\n\n<strong>BB</strong>: Think about how you read a novel: this happened, then that happened etc. We're used to reading novels in that way; authors are used to writing novels in a certain way; the author chooses the order in which you read them. Everybody encodes the story in their own way. Sequence is way over-emphasized when we're talking about print. Hypertext allows you to flip back in the sequence. The [hypertext] author takes away unnecessary sequence; if you're wiling to float a little bit, and engage with the interface, then it's not that different.\n\n<strong>DL</strong>: <em>Disappearing Rain</em> is my mystery novel -- in many different forms you see the story evolve. Everybody reads in a different way. You create, within the same work, a lot of different complexities. We design for a variety of audiences. You can have a exploratory view of the work; something that seems very simple, can actually be very complex, which is the beauty of it.\n\n<em>How may MITH best preserve this collection, and make it accessible to researchers?</em>\n\n<strong>BB</strong>: So many electronic records have disappeared. We are at the edge of the cliff; stuff is falling over every day. We must save what we have.\n\n<strong>DL</strong>: We want to document what happened in the incunabula of literature development. MITH can play a huge role by having a test-bed archive. MITH has these materials and scholars can come in and [read about] what was happening during this time. The collection contains extensive articles and press on \"how the world reacted to the Internet.\" Someone may use this material to research the development of the concept of links as semantic tools, how people morphed the tools to meet literary needs. The field of digital archiving is becoming very large very quickly. Will this period become the digital dark age or the digital light age?\n\nIn fact, the Deena Larsen Collection has been consulted lately by Leighton Christiansen, Masters Candidate in Library and Information Science at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Leighton is writing his Master's Thesis on Deena Larsen’s significant, unreleased hypertext work, <em>Marble Springs, Second Edition</em>. Leighton recently visited the DLC at MITH and thoughtfully blogged about his research. Please stay tuned to the blog to read a series of posts written by Leighton about his research using the Deena Larsen Collection.[/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]",

Rhody is completing her dissertation, \"Ekphrastic Revisions: Models of Verbal-Visual Networks in Women's Contemporary Poetry,\" which theorizes a broader, more complex understanding of ekphrastic poetry—poems written to, for, or about works of visual art.\n\nDuring the fellowship, Rhody will work on her final chapter \"Review, Revise, Requery: New Methods for Studying Ekphrasis,\" which argues that computational tools for text analysis can help scholars challenge existing assumptions about the genre's tradition, tropes, and canon.\n\n\"I am thrilled to receive the Winnemore fellowship and look forward to working with MITH's talented and knowledgeable team of graphic and web designers, programmers, and data curation specialists,\" says Rhody. \"MITH offers a wealth of digital humanities experience and success from which to draw lasting and meaningful lessons, affording my project a wider, deeper impact.\"\n\nRhody's study considers the unlikely popularity of contemporary ekphrastic poems, particularly those by female poets in the U.S., and theorizes a broader, more complex model to explain how the genre operates, including accounting for inter-aesthetic relationships historically labeled as outliers. Using advanced computational methods, her project challenges longstanding critical assumptions: that poets will ultimately comment on the stillness and muteness of the visual work of art; that ekphrastic speech turns upon the typically gendered axis of inter-arts rivalry; that descriptions of art and descriptions of nature in verse are indistinguishable in style and form.\n\nBy supporting the use of computational tools to read patterns of subjects and word choice across hundreds of modern poems, her project seeks to uncover new methodologies for asking traditional humanities questions—ones stretching back as far as Homer's description of Achilles' shield in <em>The Illiad</em>—from new perspectives and with fresh insight.\n\nWelcome, Lisa! We are thrilled to have you.",

    "wp post content": "COLLEGE PARK, MD—The <strong>Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities </strong>at the University of Maryland and the <strong>Book Industry Study Group</strong> are pleased to announce <strong>Books.Files</strong>, a new project funded by <strong>The</strong> <strong>Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</strong> to assess the potential for the archival collection and scholarly study of digital assets associated with today’s trade publishing and bookmaking.\n\n\n\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"298\"]<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/brewbooks/2499689386\"><img class=\"\" src=\"https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2010/2499689386_b13cdb37fc_b.jpg\" width=\"298\" height=\"224\" /></a> Photo by <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/brewbooks/2499689386\">brewbooks</a>.[/caption]\n\n\n\nThe fact is that nearly all printed books now begin—and for many practical purposes end—their lifecycles as digital files that are produced and managed by designers, editors, publishers, packagers, and printers. The printed book that we hold in our hands is just one of the outputs that can be derived from these digital assets, which are also used to produce ebooks and Web-ready texts. In particular, the role of Adobe InDesign and other software tools is not well understood outside of the industry. And yet, this is where the book stops being a manuscript and starts <i>becoming</i> a book, by way of its transformation into a prescribed set of digital assets which in addition to the text may include stylesheets, fonts, metadata, images, and other design elements.\n\n\n\nLed by principal investigator <strong>Matthew Kirschenbaum</strong>, this project represents the first organized attempt to put ambassadors from the scholarly communities traditionally invested in safeguarding and studying the material history of bookmaking into contact and conversation with thought leaders and influencers from the contemporary publishing world. The centerpiece of the project will be a <strong>convening</strong> to bring those figures together in New York City in early 2018;  Kirschenbaum’s efforts will also be supported by <strong>site visits</strong> to observe the bookmaking process as it unfolds across different settings, and <strong>interviews</strong> with industry experts. Findings for scholars, archivists, and publishers will be presented in a <strong>white paper</strong> made publicly available in late 2018.\n\n\n\n“Digital technologies have forever altered publishing workflows,” commented BISG executive director <strong>Brian O’Leary</strong>. “We’re looking forward to working with Professor Kirschenbaum to explore current practice and its impact on our ability to preserve content for future generations.” “This project represents an exciting extension of MITH’s long-standing interest in preserving born-digital culture,” said <strong>Trevor Muñoz</strong>, MITH interim director. “We’re delighted to partner in this effort.” <strong>Karla Nielsen</strong>, curator at Columbia University’s Rare Book and Manuscript Library, added, “For a long time publishers' archives weren't collected systematically, but now scholars are very grateful for the more complete records of earlier firms that we have, such as those of Cambridge University Press. Research libraries are just beginning to collect born-digital materials produced by publishers and this initiative will help us to understand how to do that so that there is a record of this moment of profound media change.”\n\n\n\nThe <strong>Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities</strong> is a leading digital humanities center that pursues disciplinary innovation and institutional transformation through applied research, public programming, and educational opportunities. The <strong>Book Industry Study Group</strong> is the leading book trade association for standardized best practices, research and information, and events. <strong>Matthew Kirschenbaum</strong> is Professor of English at the University of Maryland, a past Guggenheim Fellow, and author most recently <i>of Track Changes: A Literary History of Word Processing</i> (Harvard UP, 2016).\n\n\n\nInquiries about <strong>Books.Files</strong> may be sent to <a href=\"mailto:mgk@umd.edu\">Matthew Kirschenbaum</a>.",

This is MITH's third DH Start-Up and the second for Dr. Reside in what is an increasingly competitive program---this past round, only about 14% of applicants were funded.\r\n\r\nThe Electronic Broadway project will create an interface for electronic editions of musical theater texts and, as a prototype, develop an electronic edition of the new Broadway musical <em>Glory Days</em>. We hope, with this project, to encourage a reconsideration of the definition of the \"edition\" in the field of the performing arts. We will also explore, in this project, the problem of editing a text that was mostly composed electronically.  Like so many new literary works, <em>Glory Days</em> was written using digital tools (Word processors, digital music recorders, etc.) and so the primary sources are, in many cases, preserved as bits on magnetic media rather than as ink on paper.  The creative team often collaborated via instant messages and email (many of which have been preserved) thereby creating a record of the creative process theater historians of earlier periods would envy. The creators kept meticulous archives of the various versions of their script during rehearsals, and so the work of the critical editor lies in organizing and collating electronic, rather than manuscript drafts (a process which will become increasingly common in the future of editing and textual criticism).  This project will seek to provide solutions to these new editorial problems.\r\n\r\nAccording to RESIDE, \"The Digital Humanities has, until very recently, been a very text-centric field, which has exploited the multimedial powers of modern computers in only superficial ways.  A performance text, particularly a musical theater performance text, however, is intended to communicate through the simultaneous expression of verbal, musical, and terpsichorean languages and cannot be easily reduced to print.  We hope to provide a new and better way for scholars to approach this exceptionally multimedial artform.\" MITH Director NEIL FRAISTAT adds, \"This grant promises to change the way that musical theatre is both documented and studied in the classroom, and it is only the first of a series of exciting new MITH initiatives in the performing arts, all under the very capable leadership of our assistant director, Doug Reside.\"",

    "wp post content": "<i>This is the fourth in <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/tag/transgender-usenet-archive/\" target=\"_blank\">series of blog posts</a> by 2016-17 Winnemore Digital Dissertation Fellow Avery Dame on the progress of his dissertation, “<a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/?p=18022\" target=\"_blank\">Talk Amongst Yourselves: Community Formation in Transgender Counterpublic Discourse Online</a>,” which explores the affective and structural meanings assigned to “community” in English-language transgender discourse online.</i>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">“On the Internet, nobody knows you’re a dog.” Most folks have no doubt encountered this adage, coined in </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you%27re_a_dog\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">a 1993 </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">New Yorker</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> cartoon</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, through one of the many, many </span><a href=\"http://www.alandavidperkins.com/nkiad/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">cultural riffs</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberdog\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">references</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, or maybe in a reproduction of the original cartoon. The idea, of course, represents public perceptions about anonymity, privacy, and the internet prevalent at the time of its publication: that one’s online and offline presences could be largely disconnected from each other.</span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When the cartoon was first published, the sentiment certainly seemed more likely to be true in theory (though not always in practice). Particularly throughout the 1990s into the mid-2000s, the internet was thought to be a safe space for engaging in a variety of identity play, and transgender individuals were uniquely poised to benefit. One’s offline identity was not always tightly bound to their online presence, certainly not closely as social network sites like Facebook </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_real-name_policy_controversy\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">might wish them to be</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">—a change reflected in a </span><a href=\"http://newyorker.tumblr.com/post/111446912131/a-cartoon-by-kaamran-hafeez-from-this-weeks\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2015 follow-up cartoon of the dogs reminiscing about their prior anonymity</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Online, trans individuals could take steps to disconnect their offline selves from their online identities, where they might adopt different names and gender identities that better reflected their own self-understanding. While I didn’t identify as transgender at the time, I nevertheless engaged in these practices myself as a teenager, often failing to ‘correct’ individuals who, presciently, assumed I was male. </span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">However, my online life at the time was entirely pseudonymous, and I made sure to keep a certain distance between my offline and online selves. This has allowed me to keep my prior online activities (as well as my past opinions on the state of the World of Warcraft endgame) largely divorced from my current online presence. Other individuals, particularly early users whose online access came through an employer or university, may not have been able to maintain such a clean separation. Bits of one’s offline identity—elements of a legal name used for official company email address, differing names between those used in messages and those attached to email accounts, or an “official” email signature—remained connected to online activities, including posting to Usenet. For trans individuals, these traces can reveal distinctly gendered or pre-transition names, employment, or activities they might otherwise wish was not widely known. </span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As I get closer to a launch-ready version of the Transgender Usenet Archive, much of my attention has been focused on thinking through my ethical responsibility to these users. At the core of the project are two impulses. On one hand, I hope to increase the accessibility and reach of an important, if undiscussed, part of recent transgender history. As a consequence, however, I am giving these posts a new kind of visibility beyond the initial level of access (which, admittedly, you can already get through the Google Groups archive). Given this increased access, I am also deeply invested in conscientiously respecting not only posters’ agency as authors, but also their privacy as individuals, who may have treated their posts as ephemeral communications, not meant for academic analysis.</span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Because there’s not a lot of guidance for working with Usenet materials, I’ve looked to other instances where archivists faces similar concerns. </span><a href=\"http://tararobertson.ca/2016/lita-keynote/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Tara Robertson’s writing on the ethical implications of Reveal Digital’s scanning and posting of the On Our Backs backcatalogue</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> (since taken down) speak compellingly to the importance of thinking carefully about consent, representation, and digital access. One difference between OOB and other digitized materials is Usenet’s status as the organizing umbrella under which a variety of public fora lived. Usenet newsgroups, and by extension users’ posts, were always ‘public’ in terms of accessibility. However, posts were not archived and made available on a mass scale until DejaNews started collecting them in 1995; the current Google archive, and thus the collections the archive is based on, are made up of what DejaNews collected, along with several other donated collections of pre-1995 material. Following DejaNews’s announcement, users concerned about privacy successfully advocated for DejaNews to adopt the </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-No-Archive\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">the</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">X-No-Archive” header</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, which signalled a post shouldn’t be archived. However, DejaNews’s choice to respect users’ wishes to XNAY (for X-No-Archive: yes) their posts was voluntary—a policy Google (which acquired DejaNews in 2001) has continued to follow to this day. </span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Nevertheless, the fact users had the option to XNAY posts when they were first written doesn’t guarantee they would want their posts to be publicly available now. With contemporary indexing and archiving tools, what might have seemed “privately public” in 1997 now can be made, in incautious hands, all too public. With </span><a href=\"https://github.com/apdame/usenet-tools\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">some fairly simple Python scripts</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, I’ve been able to collect, count, and index thousands of user names and emails, including building </span><a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/visualizing-poster-activity-usenet/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">a whole network of users’ communication</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. </span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Google Groups archive has functionally performed such indexing on a massive scale, making </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">all of these posts (and their attached content, some of it clearly not intended for such a mass audience) available to anyone who wishes to access it. Individuals can request for archived posts be removed, but </span><a href=\"https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/apps/qHNKeRuT_bc\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">the process for doing so is opaque at best.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> As </span><a href=\"https://medium.com/message/never-trust-a-corporation-to-do-a-librarys-job-f58db4673351#.nhcbu5shk\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Andy Baio rightly notes</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, Google’s primary interest here is not in in acting as a good steward of the internet’s past but in maximizing profitability. In a internet landscape dominated by social network sites (including Google’s underwhelming entry into the field, Google+), personal data mining, and algorithmic filtering, Usenet is neither ripe for personal data mining nor very profitable. In fact, it’s the exact opposite: an unstructured, decentralized system now best known as a resource for illegal file sharing. Thus, there appears to be little financial incentive to investing energy into the archive.</span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In her discussion of the impact of Reveal’s choice to make OOB widely available, Robertson makes it a point to connect this act with the people it most directly impacts: those in the photographs. In reaching out to these individuals for their reactions, her opinion shifts as a result of her own community membership, as “‘the community’ wasn’t an abstract notion, it was the people who gave me those generous quotes. I could see their faces and empathize with their fears and feelings that institutions had screwed them over again.” These moments, Robertson suggests, require archivists, librarians, and others to act with an ethics of care, which </span><a href=\"http://nowviskie.org/2015/on-capacity-and-care/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bethany Nowviskie</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> argues focuses a researcher or practitioner on two key areas:</span>\n\n<blockquote><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">“The first is toward an appreciation of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">context, interdependence, and vulnerability</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">—of fragile, little things and their interrelation. The second is an orientation not toward objective evaluation and judgment (as in the philosophical mainstream of ethics)—not, that is, toward </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">criticism</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">—but toward personal, worldly </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">action and response</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.”</span></blockquote>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I, like Robertson, am both a professional (academic researcher, in this case) and a community member, and these roles shape my thinking. While I’m interested in making these discussions accessible, I also want to recognize and respect their contextual particularities and constraints. Robertson suggests the </span><a href=\"http://zinelibraries.info/code-of-ethics/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Zine Librarians’ Code of Ethics</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> as source of guidance, and I’ve drawn on it in designing the Transgender Usenet Archive. </span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In design, I’ve chosen to take several different steps to preserve individual privacy and encourage good, respectful practice. The archive will be publicly available to anyone who wishes to use it, but accessing the archive will require users to informally agree that they are agreeing to use it for non-commercial personal, teaching, learning or research reasons only. All of the posts included in the archive have been selectively indexed and do not include headers which might contain identifiable information, such as emails and names. However, I have not altered posts’ content in any way, so any message sign-offs and email signatures that were already included in posts will appear in the archive as is.</span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I’ve also manually removed any 64-bit code for images (such as personal photographs, etc) that include any possibly identifying features (such as full body or face shots); these images have been marked with &lt;IMAGE REDACTED FOR PRIVACY&gt;. There’s a long history of repurposing and reposting trans women’s photos online without their consent, and I don’t want to contribute to it through the archive. Because I can’t determine the particular provenance of these photos (especially given that many were attached to mass-mailed spam), I’ve chosen to err on the side of caution and redact these images. </span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lastly, I want to do my utmost to respect and support posters’ right to refusal. Unfortunately, the scale and amount of content in the archive makes attempting to contact individual posters unfeasible. However, this post is meant to offer individuals a chance to let me know if they’d like their posts not to be included. Please feel free to reach out to me <a href=\"mailto:adame@umd.edu\">via email</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> if you think your posts might be in the archive and would like them removed, or if you have any other questions or concerns. As part of the archive site, I’ll also be offering will be a contact form for individuals whose would like to inquire about if their posts are included in the archive. </span>",

    "wp post content": "Over the past several weeks since my first blog post about researching digital scholarly editions, I have begun to consider how I could apply the lessons learned from my literature review to a digital scholarly edition of Katherine Anne Porter's correspondence. As I draft several key pieces of documentation for such an edition—a name authority index and gazetteer and a TEI keying specification—I find myself preoccupied with thoughts about the relationship between textual creativity and technology, between the language of literature and the language of encoding, metaphor and algorithm.\n\nPerhaps I spent a bit too much time at the Computer History Museum over Spring Break in my childhood home of California, where, between learning how to use a slide rule and Instagramming photos of the PDP-1, I developed a fascination with Ada Lovelace. The daughter of the poet Lord Byron and his mathematically-inclined wife Anne Isabella Milbanke (whom he called his \"Princess of Parallelograms\"), Ada displayed an uncanny gift for scientific thought. Her parents separated shortly after her birth, and Ada grew up with her mother, who attempted to save Ada from the perils of poetical tendencies by educating her in mathematics and music. Ada's talent and training found legendary expression in her notes on Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine—notes that included what many recognize to be the first algorithm to be processed by machine, and thus, made her the first computer programmer.\n\nIt is rumored that the adult Ada once asked in a letter to her mother, \"If you can't give me poetry, can't you give me poetical science?\" and indeed, Ada relied on access to imagination, metaphor, and simile in voicing her scientific thoughts. \"The Analytical Engine weaves algebraic patterns just as the Jacquard loom weaves flowers and leaves,\" she wrote at age twenty-eight, and I think of TEI, of an encoding engine and a tracing of patterns that seems agonizingly intricate, both purely practical and somehow inevitably creative. Could it be that Ada, Babbage's \"Enchantress of Numbers,\" was equal parts programmer and poet? After all, both endeavors are rooted in language, in iterative rhetoric, and in choosing the right word…which is exactly what Katherine Anne Porter insisted on: \"I beg of the reader one gentle favor for which he may be sure of my perpetual gratitude: please do not call my short novels <em>Novelettes</em>, or even worse, <em>Novellas</em>,\" she urged in the introduction to her <em>Collected Stories</em> in 1965. \"Novelette is classical usage for a trivial, dime-novel sort of thing; Novella is a slack, boneless, affected word that we do not need to describe anything. Please call my books by their right names…\"\n\nIn choosing the labels we use to refer to ideas and the tags we select to encode texts, we are using the mechanics of language to craft arguments and to reason. In some way, we are filtering what might be remembered, performing an algorithm of appraisal and selection just as an archivist might deem one photo worthy of preservation and \"weed\" the next. Porter knew as much about this figurative \"weeding\" and collecting as she did about tending the Geraniums and Forget-me-nots in her backyard garden. \"Well, angel, here's another long winded letter for you to send back,\" she wrote to her sister Gay Porter Holloway in 1957, referring to her project of carefully constructing an archive of her own outgoing correspondence. \"It's odd,\" she continued: \"A friend just wrote me that she wanted to send me the letters I had written to her and her husband for years, she did not want them lost or scattered, but with my papers. And a man at Yale bought some letters of mine from somebody…and I have written to ask him if I may see them and copy them. I cannot imagine who is selling my letters, nor where he or she got hold of them.\" Nearly a decade later, Porter donated this archive of letters to the University of Maryland. She died in 1980, the same year that the U.S. Department of Defense announced a programming language they had cultivated and groomed to become the universal standard (though it inevitably gave way to a constellation of child languages). They chose for it a palindrome of a name, a perfect trochee, \"Ada.\"\n\n<em>Wendy Hagenmaier is a 2012 Master's Candidate at the School of Information at the University of Texas at Austin.

The digital libraries and archives fields have produced high quality repository and collections management software, but these packages carry too much technical overhead and pay too little attention to web presentation and end user interface for most digital humanities projects. Commercial blog packages have made it easy for digital humanists to publish materials to the web, but the blog's structure of serial text posts does not allow them to present deep collections or complex narratives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat is why the Center for History and New Media (CHNM) at George Mason University, in partnership with the Minnesota Historical Society, has created Omeka . From the Swahili word meaning \"to display\" or \"to lay out for discussion,\" Omeka is a next generation web publishing platform for academic work of all kinds, one that bridges the university, library, and museum worlds through--and by helping to advance--a set of commonly recognized web and metadata standards. Omeka is free and open source. It offers low installation and maintenance costs--appealing to individual scholars and smaller cultural heritage projects and institutions that lack technical staffs and large budgets. It is standards based, extensible, and interoperable--insuring compliance with accessibility guidelines and integration with existing digital collections systems to help digital humanists of all stripes design online exhibitions more efficiently. Omeka brings Web 2.0 technologies and approaches to digital humanities websites--fostering the kind of user interaction and participation that are central to the mission of digital humanities, and providing the contribution mechanisms, tagging facilities, and social networking tools that audiences are coming to expect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the first part of this session, Omeka Executive Producer, Tom Scheinfeldt, will introduce the ideas and technologies behind Omeka. In the second part, Omeka Community Liason, Dave Lester, will demo the software, provide tips for getting started, and explain how you can get involved in Omeka's open source community. An extended period of Q&amp;A will follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTom Scheinfeldt is Managing Director of the Center for History and New Media and Research Assistant Professor of History in the Department of History and Art History at George Mason University. Dr. Scheinfeldt received his bachelor's degree from Harvard and his master's and doctoral degrees from Oxford, where his doctoral thesis examined inter-war interest in science and its history in diverse cultural contexts, including museums, universities, World's Fairs and the mass media. A research associate at the Smithsonian Institution Archives and a fellow of the Science Museum, London, Dr. Scheinfeldt has lectured and written extensively on the history of popular science, the history of museums, history and new media, and the changing role of history in society, and has worked on traditional exhibitions and digital projects at the Colorado Historical Society, the Museum of the History of Science in Oxford, The Louisiana State Museum, the National Museum of American History, and the Library of Congress. In addition to managing general operations at the Center for History and New Media, Dr. Scheinfeldt directs several of its online history projects, including Omeka , the September 11 Digital Archive , the Papers of the War Department, 1784-1800 , and Gulag: Many Days, Many Lives .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDave Lester is the Omeka Community Lead at the Center for History and New Media, and an active developer on the Omeka project.  He is also Digital Curator of the American Studies Crossroads Project at Georgetown University, launching a series of exhibitions focusing on the confluence of cultural studies and information technology.  Dave is the co-founder of ScholarPress, a development hub for Educational WordPress plugins , co-organized this year's THATCamp, a barcamp-style Digital Humanities unconference , and is organizing an upcoming Wordcamp for Educators .\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nComing up @MITH 10/7: Brent Seales (University of Kentucky), \"EDUCE:  Enhanced Digital Unwrapping for Conservation and Exploration.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nView MITH's complete Digital Dialogues schedule here:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20100608224835/http://www.mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_fall_2008.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll talks free and open to the public!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-8927).\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20131230203536/http://mith.umd.edu/programs/digitaldialogue/mp3/kraus.mp3\">\r\n\r\n </a>",

    "wp post content": "During the weeks of April 14 - May 3, I was fortunate to spend my MLIS practicum at MITH under the supervision of Trevor Munoz. My main reason for applying to MITH as a potential practicum site was my background in the digital humanities and library and information studies, as well as my interest in data curation and research data management in the humanities. I also wanted to apply the skills I learned in the “Data Curation for Digital Humanists” course at the Digital Humanities Winter Institute hosted by MITH and the University of Maryland in January of 2013 (taught by Trevor and Dorothea Salo from UW-Madison.) I was pleased, then, to discover what a unique project Trevor chose for us during my time at MITH.\n\nOur main project was to imagine ways to curate the publicly available data from the New York Public Library’s <a href=\"http://menus.nypl.org/\">“What’s on the Menu?”</a> (WOTM) special collection of digitized historical menus. The Library crowdsourced the transcription of the digitized menus via the project website and compiled the completed menu transcriptions into large spreadsheets, which are updated every two weeks as more data continue to be produced. Recently, NYPL Labs added <a title=\"NYPL Menus Geotagger\" href=\"http://menusgeo.herokuapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">a geo-tagging tool</a> to add geospatial information to the historical menus, where available. An award-winning digital project, NYPL’s “What’s on the Menu?” is a great resource for exploring data curation in practice as it is free, openly accessible, and a subject of interest to humanists.\n\nOur task as data curators, therefore, involved cleaning up, organizing, classifying, describing, structuring, representing and otherwise making more accessible the data provided on the “What’s on the Menu?” site. A user exploring the project site will quickly discover that, while over 26,000 menus have been digitized and displayed online, one can only browse them by the year the menus were produced, the name of the restaurant that produced the menu, and the total number of dishes that appeared on the menu. In other words, there is no thematic or categorical classification of these menus that would appeal to the discovery of the rich historical and cultural information contained in this unique collection. We decided that categorizing and classifying the WOTM data to support richer browsing was curatorial activity that might add value.\n\nBefore we began to categorize and curate this data, however, it was important to take stock of our data at hand. Essentially, we downloaded two spreadsheets from the WOTM site: one “Menus” set containing over 28,000 rows of data (the names and types of menu pages) and one “Dishes” set containing over 400,000 rows of data (the individual names of dishes that appeared on those menus, including their prices). After assessing the data, we wrote a data management plan (in best Digital Humanist practice) for the work we were about to begin in curating the Menus and the Dishes data.\n\n<strong>Use Cases</strong>\n\nWhile we could speculate on the potential usefulness of the data in this collection, it's always better to have actual evidence of what users want. NYPL Labs graciously shared summaries of the requests they have received from people requesting credentials to use the WOTM application programming interface (API). These short description served as evidence of user needs, which would help guide our decision-making process. Historians, social scientists, journalists, literary food scholars, chefs, novelists, teachers and students, as well as general enthusiasts all showed interest in access to this data. In order to make the menus more accessible for these potential users, we had to imagine what types of questions they might ask of this information. This would inform the general working taxonomy, or information architecture, of our data set.\n\n<strong>Data Cleaning</strong>\n\nFirst, however, we needed to clean it up. As you can imagine, crowdsourced data tends to me messy, containing many spelling variations, typos, ambiguities, and missing fields. We used <a href=\"http://openrefine.org/\">OpenRefine</a> (formerly GoogleRefine) software to cluster and rename data fields that we considered of particular use or interest to future users of this collection, principally names of the businesses offering these menus and also, where present, the names of the categories (supplied by original cataloguers?) to which the menus had been assigned. While OpenRefine helped with the initial clustering, the large number of name and spelling variations meant some tedious line-by-line editing. This is also the data curator’s job.\n\n<strong>Categorization</strong>\n\nUpon a general data cleanup, I was excited to launch into the categorizing! While working on my taxonomy of menus and dishes, I learned the difference between taxonomies, thesauri and ontologies, and have built up a nice working list of controlled vocabularies to consult for various subjects. Overall, when creating the taxonomy of the menus, I focused on what the potential users of this data might seek in this unique collection. As such, I developed three levels of classification with four broad categories by which to group the menus. These included the <em>Hosting Organization</em> that sponsored the menu, <em>Type of Meal</em> the menu reflected, the <em>Restaurant Address</em> where the meal was held, as well as the <em>Type of Gathering</em> for which the menu was produced. For example, we decided that users might be interested in exploring political and military meals held in the “What’s on the Menu?” collection, as well as browsing the menus created for special occasions, such as George Washington’s Birthday meals. While our taxonomy structure is not the definitive version of this data, Trevor and I nonetheless believe that providing users with the ability to browse all wedding menus, High Society Banquets or meals held for royal individuals, for example, was a value-added service that data curators can provide. In other words, our categories were additional ways to enter, explore and understand this special collection that lead to discovery and learning.\n\nUser testing and evaluation was another important step in the curation process, as it allowed us to see whether we were on the right track with our curatorial practice. While we may have been following good metadata standards, referring to controlled vocabularies and linking URIs to our classification terms, none of this work would ultimately have mattered if the users could not navigate the data quickly and easily. I discovered a useful tool called <a href=\"http://www.optimalworkshop.com/treejack.htm\">TreeJack</a>, which allows information architects to test their tree structure (the organization of information) by providing anonymous users with <a href=\"https://nypl-data.optimalworkshop.com/treejack/nyplmenus\">several tasks to complete</a>. We also asked our test subjects to answer three brief survey questions about the choice of terms used to create the categories for the menus. Based on the feedback we received, we changed the placement and labeling of certain categories. Ultimately, a final user testing of this data curation project would help evaluate it as a whole.\n\n<strong>Prototyping</strong>\n\nFinally, in my last week, we decided to develop a kind of proof-of-concept for our data curation work and display it online. Inspired by Aaron Straup Cope’s talk at the Library of Congress about his work on <a href=\"http://www.aaronland.info/weblog/2011/10/14/pixelspace/#parallel-flickr\">“Parallel Flickr”</a>, Trevor and I tried to imagine our own “Parallel Menus” to experiment with our newly-minted categories for this data. Initially, after inserting the two spreadsheets into a MySQL database hosted on my University of Alberta web server, I created a query to display each category on its own static web page by writing some PHP scripts. Trevor, however, taught me about Bootstrap, a front-end design framework, that allowed us to make our Parallel Menus a little more interactive through Java Script. Finally, using the API key which Trevor obtained from NYPL, we were able to get thumbnail images of our menus from the “What’s on the Menu?” API service and insert them into our web code to entice the users of the taxonomy into browsing our site.\n\n<strong>Next Steps</strong>\n\nClearly, my three weeks at MITH went by quickly, and I didn’t have a chance to work on the Dishes side of our WOTM data. Nonetheless, I kept documentation for my work as we went along, and even developed some categories and controlled vocabulary terms for organizing this much larger data set. Trevor will be teaching several Data Curation workshops in the coming months, and I hope that he will be able to expand on my practicum work by getting students to work on the Dishes part of this project. I hope that the “What’s on the Menu?” Data Curation project will eventually be handed over to NYPL to help make their site even more usable to the many visitors they receive each day. I would be honored if, upon handing it back to the New York Public Library, they used any of our suggestions with regard to organizing and classifying this data.\n\nDuring my practicum, I appreciated participating both in the administrative duties of digital humanists, such as attending project meetings, policy and grant writing, and data audits as well as in more creative tasks such as attending talks at the Library of Congress, exploring new tools, and participating in the MITH Incubator project by helping librarians develop their own research projects. I especially valued the way Trevor combined the practical with the theoretical, getting me to think about the broader implications of the data curation process – its costs, its biases and limitations, its potential, its role in the creation of new knowledge. Working on this project gave me a whole new perspective on research data in the humanities, and I believe it will help me complete my thesis, as well as further my career. This was definitely a transformative experience.\n\nOverall, I am incredibly grateful to have had the opportunity to put my skills and interests in digital humanities data curation at MITH with Trevor’s leadership. In addition to meeting the wonderful MITH team, many visiting scholars and the larger DC digital humanities community, I learned many exciting and useful things in my time at UMD: APIs, JQuery, LCSH Linked Data Service, OpenRefine and its RDF plug-in, TreeJack and tree testing, GitHub, Freebase, along with many others. I look forward to visiting MITH again in the future and launching DH curation projects of my own!",

    "wp post content": "The research I am doing presently uses visualizations to show latent patterns that may be detected in a set of poems using computational tools, such as topic modeling. In particular, I’m looking at poetry that takes visual art as its subject, a genre called ekphrasis, in an attempt to distinguish the types of language poets tend to invoke when creating a verbal art that responds to a visual one. Studying words’ relationships to images and then creating more images to represent those patterns calls to mind a longstanding contest between modes of representation—which one represents information “better”? Since my research is dedicated to revealing the potential for collaborative and kindred relationships between modes of representation historically seen in competition with one another, using images to further demonstrate patterns of language might be seen as counter-productive. Why use images to make literary arguments? Do images tell us something “new” that words cannot?\n\n\n\nWithout answering that question, I’d like instead to present an instance of when using images (visualizations of data) to “see” language led to an improved understanding of the kinds of questions we might ask and the types of answers we might want to look for that wouldn’t have been possible had we not seen them differently—through graphical array.\n\n\n\nCurrently, I’m using a tool called MALLET to create a model of the possible “topics” found in a set of 276 ekphrastic poems. There are already several excellent explanations of what topic modeling is and how it works (many thanks to <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20120520111910/https://www.stanford.edu/~mjockers/cgi-bin/drupal/node/61\">Matt Jockers</a>, <a href=\"http://tedunderwood.wordpress.com/2012/04/07/topic-modeling-made-just-simple-enough/\">Ted Underwood</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.scottbot.net/HIAL/?p=221\">Scott Weingart</a> who posted these explanations with humanists in mind), so I’m not going to spend time explaining what the tool does here; however, I will say that working with a set of 276 poems is atypical. Topic modeling was designed to work on millions of words, and 276 poems doesn’t even come close; however, part of the project has been to determine a threshold at which we can get meaningful results from a small dataset. So, this particular experiment is playing with the lower thresholds of the tool’s usefulness.\n\n\n\nWhen you run a topic model (train-topics) in MALLET, you tell the program how many topics to create, and when the model runs, it can output a variety of results. As part of the tinkering process, I’ve been working with the number of topics to have MALLET use in order to generate the model, and was just about to despair that the real tests I wanted to run wouldn’t be possible at 276 poems. Perhaps it was just too few poems to find recognizable patterns. For each topic assignment, MALLET assigns an ID number to the topic and “topic keys” as keywords for that topic. Usually, when the topic model is working, the results are “readable” because they represent similar language. MALLET would not call a topic “Sea,” for example, but might instead provide the following keywords:\n\n<blockquote>blue, water, waves, sea, surface, turn, green, ship, sail, sailor, drown</blockquote>\n\nThe researcher would look at those terms and think, “Oh, clearly that’s a nautical/sea/sailing” topic, and dub it as such. My results, however, on 15 topics over 276 poems were not readable in the same way. For example, topic 3 included the following topic keys:\n\n<blockquote>3 0.04026 with self portrait him god how made shape give thing centuries image more world dread he lands down back protest shaped dream upon will rulers lords slave gazes hoe future</blockquote>\n\nI don’t blame you if you don’t see the pattern there. I didn’t. Except, well, knowing some of the poems in the set pretty well, I know that it put together “Landscape with the Fall of Icarus” by W.C. Williams with “The Poem of Jacobus Sadoletus on the Statue of Laocoon” with “The New Colossus” with “The Man with the Hoe Written after Seeing the Painting by Millet.” I could see that we had lots of kinds of gods represented, farming, and statues, but that’s only because I knew the poems. Without topic modeling, I might put this category together as a “masters” grouping, but it’s not likely. Rather than look for connections, I was focused on the fact that the topic keys didn’t make a strong case for their being placed together, and other categories seemed similarly opaque. However, just to be sure that I could, in fact, visualize results of future tests, I went ahead and imported the topic associations by file. In other words, MALLET can also produce a file that lists each topic (0-14 in this case) with each file name in the dataset and a percentage. The percentage represents the degree to which the topic is represented inside each file. I imported the MALLET output of topics and files associated with them into Google Fusion Tables and created a dynamic bar graph that collects file-ids along the vertical axis and along the horizontal axis can be found the degree that the given topic (in this case topic 3) is present in the file. As I clicked through each topic’s graph, I figured I was seeing results that demonstrated MALLET’s confusion, since the dataset was so small. But then I saw this:\n\n\n\n[fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=\"yes\" overflow=\"visible\"][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=\"1_1\" background_position=\"left top\" background_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" border_color=\"\" border_style=\"solid\" spacing=\"yes\" background_image=\"\" background_repeat=\"no-repeat\" padding=\"\" margin_top=\"0px\" margin_bottom=\"0px\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_direction=\"left\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" center_content=\"no\" min_height=\"none\"][Below should be a Google Visualization. You may need to “refresh” your browser page to see it. If you still cannot see it, a static version of the file is visible <a href=\"http://www.lisarhody.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/gazer-spirit_visualization.jpg\">here</a>.]\n\n\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/fusiontables/embedviz?&amp;containerId=gviz_canvas&amp;q=select+col0%2C+col4+from+3650097+&amp;qrs=where+col0+%3E%3D+&amp;qre=+and+col0+%3C%3D+&amp;qe=+limit+247&amp;viz=GVIZ&amp;t=BAR&amp;width=650&amp;height=450\" width=\"700\" height=\"500\" frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"yes\"></iframe>\n\n\n\nIf the graph’s visualization is working, when you pass your mouse over the lines in the bar graph, the ones that are higher than 0.4, then the file-id number (a random number assigned during the course of preparing the data) appears. Each of these files begin with the same prefix: GS. In my dataset, that means that the files with the highest representation of topic 3 in them can all be found in John Hollander’s collection <em>The Gazer’s Spirit</em>. This anthology is considered to be one of the most authoritative and diverse—beginning with classical ekphrasis all the way up to and including poems from the 1980s and 1990s. I had expected, given the disparity in time periods, that the poems from this collection would be the most difficult to group together because the diction of the poems changes dramatically from the beginning of the volume to the end. In other words, I would have expected the poems to blend with the other ekphrastic poems throughout the dataset more in terms of their similar diction than by anything else. MALLET has no way of knowing that these files are included in the same anthology. All of the bibliographical information about the poems has been stripped from the text being tested. There has to be something else. What something else might be requires another layer of interpretation. I will need to return to the topic model to see if a similar pattern is present when I use other numbers of topics—or if I include some non-ekphrastic poems to the set being tested—but seeing the affinity in language between the poems included in <em>The Gazer’s Spirit</em> in contrast to other ekphrastic poems proved useful. Now, I’m not inclined to throw the whole test away, but instead to perform more tests to see if this pattern emerges again in other circumstances. I’m not at square one. I’m at a square 2 that I didn’t expect.\n\n\n\nThe visualization in the end didn’t produce “new knowledge.” It isn’t hard to imagine that an editor would choose poems that construct a particular argument about what “best” represents a particular genre of poetry; however, if these poems did truly represent the diversity of ekphrastic verse, wouldn’t we see other poems also highly associated with a “<em>Gazer’s Spirit</em> topic”? What makes these poems stand out so clearly from others of their kind? Might their similarity mark a reason for why critics of the 90s and 2000s define the tropes, canons, and traditions of ekphrasis in a particular vein? I’m now returning to the test and to the texts to see what answers might exist there that I and others have missed as close readers. Could we, for instance, run an analysis that determines how closely other kinds of ekphrasis are associated with <em>Gazer’s Spirit’s</em> definition of ekphrasis? Is it possible that poetry by male poets is more frequently associated with that strain of ekphrastic discourse than poetry by female poets?\n\n\n\nThis particular visualization doesn’t make an “argument” in the way humanists are accustomed to making them. It doesn’t necessarily produce anything wholly “new” that couldn’t have been discovered some other way; however, it did help this researcher get past a particular kind of blindness and helped me to see alternatives—to consider what has been missed along the way—and there is, and will be, something new in that.\n\n\n\n<em>Lisa Rhody is a Ph.D. candidate in English at the University of Maryland, a Spring 2012 MITH Winnemore Dissertation Fellow, and a lecturer on the arts for the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts.

    "wp post content": "<img src=\"http://www.getlamp.com/images/brasslamps.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n\nOn November 8th and 9th, JASON SCOTT, independent filmmaker, computer archivist, activist, and historian, and purveyor of tuna for @Sockington, the most popular cat on the internet, will be visiting the University of Maryland campus. Jason will screen his latest documentary film, GET LAMP, about text adventures aka interactive fiction, on the evening of Monday November 8th, at 7:00pm in Ulrich Recital Hall (in Tawes Hall). He will introduce the film and take questions afterward. The screening is free and open to the public. On Tuesday, November 9th, at 12:30, Jason Scott will deliver a talk entitled \"Where the Magnet Hits the Metal: Computer History on the Ground\" as part of the Digital Dialogues series at the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH). MITH is located on the basement level of McKeldin Library. The talk is also free and open to the public.\n\nJason's visit is co-sponsored by MITH, the Digital Cultures and Creativity program in the Honors College, and the Computer Science Department. For more information, please contact Matthew Kirschenbaum,  301-405-8505 or mgk at umd dot edu.\n\nMore about Jason:\nJASON SCOTT is a computer historian and documentary filmmaker who has been collecting, archiving and presenting computer history for over 20 years. Most of his collections can be seen online at the site TEXTFILES.COM, which began as a small archive of 1980s computer bulletin board history and has expanded to over fifty years of documents and artifacts. Besides presenting at computer conferences and other events, Jason has also shot two documentaries, BBS THE DOCUMENTARY and GET LAMP, the second of which covers the text adventure game genre, a precursor to the modern games industry. An outspoken critic of poor data archiving and destruction of digital history, Jason co-founded Archive Team, an activist group of rogue archivists dedicated to saving digital history and gaining attention to the importance of the artifacts online communities. Improbably, he also works for the most popular cat on Twitter, @sockington, who has nearly a million and a half followers.\n\nMore about GET LAMP:\nAt the dawn of the era of home computing, an unusual type of game was the most popular to play. With just a screen of text and a prompt, you would be asked the simple question: What do you want to do next? As you typed in commands and sentences, the games would tell you a story a story fraught with danger, excitement, puzzles and hours of exploration. They were called text adventures, adventure games, and interactive fiction. They dominated the sales charts and introduced millions to the power and flexibility of home computers. No other type of computer game could come close. And then they were gone forever. Or maybe they never actuallyleft. Director Jason Scott interviewed dozens of creators, players, and scholars about the experience and effect of text adventures and interactive fiction. The result is Get Lamp, a documentary with multiple paths that takes you from a cave deep in Kentucky to the arrival of what some think is a brand new form of literature. What do you want to do next? (Trailer for GET LAMP:<a href=\"http://www.getlamp.com/\"> http://www.getlamp.com/</a>).",

We resolved that our present, proposed, and future activities are  interdependent and complementary and should be oriented towards working together to overcome barriers, and to create a shared environment where technology services can interoperate and be sustained, thus enabling new forms of research in the Humanities.\n\n\n\nIn order to achieve these goals we agreed to form the Coalition of Humanities and Arts Infrastructures and Networks -- CHAIN. CHAIN will act as a forum for areas of shared interest to its participants, including:\n\n\n\n-      advocacy for an improved  digital research infrastructure for the Humanities;\n\n-      development of sustainable business models;\n\n-      promotion of technical interoperability of resources, tools and services;\n\n-      promotion of good practice and relevant technical standards;\n\n-      development of a shared service infrastructure;\n\n-      coordinating approaches to legal and ethical issues;\n\n-      interactions with other relevant computing infrastructure initiatives;\n\n-      widening the geographical scope of our coalition.\n\n\n\nCHAIN will promote an open culture where experiences, including successes and failures, can be shared and discussed, in order to support and promote the use of digital technologies in research in the Humanities.\n\n\n\nSheila Anderson, King's College, London (DARIAH)\n\nAndreas Aschenbrenner, State and University Library GÃ¶ttingen (TextGrid, DARIAH)\n\nDavid Greenbaum, University of California, Berkeley (Project Bamboo)\n\nSeth Denbo, King's  College, London (DARIAH)\n\nNeil Fraistat, University of Maryland (centerNet)\n\nChad Kainz, University of Chicago (Project Bamboo)\n\nSteven Krauwer, Utrecht University (CLARIN)\n\nLorna Hughes, King's  College, London (ADHO, NoC)\n\nTobias Blanke, King's College, London (DARIAH)\n\nTorsten Reimer, King's  College, London (arts-humanities.net)\n\nDavid Robey, University of Oxford (NoC)\n\nHarold Short, King's  College, London  (ADHO)\n\nKatherine Walter, University of Nebraska-Lincoln (centerNet)\n\nPeter Wittenburg, Max-Planck-Gesellschaft (CLARIN)\n\nMartin Wynne, University of Oxford (CLARIN, DARIAH)",

A growing, international body of classicists are dedicated not simply to creating digital tools but to reimagining the field against the opportunities and challenges of the digital world in which we already live. On the one hand, we are beginning to see new possibilities for research that were not feasible with the tools of print culture. At the same time, and perhaps even more importantly, we are seeing a reorganization of who can participate and what they can contribute. We can see the possibility of a truly global field emerging, with implications far beyond the traditional bounds of\n\nclassical studies.\n\n\n\nGREG CRANE is currently a Professor of Classics, as well as Editor-in-Chief of the Perseus Project at Tufts University.  He has written two books on Thucydides; The Blinded Eye &amp; The Ancient Simplicity, and is currently conducting preliminary research for a planned book on Cicero.  He is particularly interested in the extent to which broadcast media such as the World Wide Web not only enhance the work of professional researchers and students in formal degree programs but create new audiences outside academia for cultural materials. His current research focuses on \"computational humanities\" and how this new field can help to democratize information without compromising intellectual rigor.\n\n\n\nComing up @ MITH 11/17: Jennifer Fleeger (Catholic), &quot;Archiving America: The Vitaphone, the DVD, and Warner Bros.

    "wp post content": "A MITH Digital Dialogue\n\nTuesday, April 14, 12:30-1:45\n\nMITH Conference Room, McKeldin Library B0135\n\n\n\n\"Formalization, Transformation, and the Digital Scholarly Edition\"\n\nby ANDREW STAUFFER\n\n\n\nThis talk considers how the scholarly edition (whether print or digital) processes information via formalization, and about the implications of this for our understanding and practice of digital scholarly editing. More specifically, I identify a basic concern with the protocols governing best practices in digital text editing -- namely, XML markup with a TEI schema. Because of such protocols and their associated transformations, online scholarly editions are vitiated by a gap between the edition as formalized in markup language and the edition as encountered by the end user. Part of my argument is on behalf of fuller transparency for online projects, which need to turn themselves inside out on demand. Scholar-users need to know more about the provenance of the data they encounter in web environments and not remain satisfied with the orchestrated performances that the interface runs.\n\n\n\nANDREW STAUFFER is an associate professor of English at the University of Virginia, where he also serves as the director of the NINES project (http://nines.org).  He is the author of /Anger, Revolution, and Romanticism/ (Cambridge UP, 2005), and has edited works by Robert Browning (Norton) and H. Rider Haggard (Broadview). He has published a number of essays on topics in nineteenth-century British literature, and he served as a research assistant on the Rossetti Archive in the 1990s. He is writing a book, /The Digital End of the Scholarly Edition/, for the University of Michigan Press.\n\n\n\nComing up @MITH 4/21: Mills Kelly, \"What Happens When You Teach Your Students to Lie Online?\"\n\n\n\nView MITH's complete Digital Dialogues schedule here:\n\n\n\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20100615144914/http://www.mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_spring_2009.pdf\n\n\n\nAll talks free and open to the public!\n\n\n\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-8927).",

    "wp post content": "A MITH Digital Dialogue\n\nTuesday, February 24, 12:30-1:45\n\nMITH Conference Room, McKeldin Library B0135\n\n\n\nThe Archimedes Palimpsest  is a\n\nmanuscript of extraordinary importance to the history of science. This\n\nthirteenth century prayer book contains erased texts that were written\n\nseveral centuries earlier still. These erased texts include two\n\ntreatises by Archimedes that can be found nowhere else, The Method and\n\nStomachion. The manuscript sold at auction to a private collector on\n\nthe 29th October 1998. The owner deposited the manuscript at The\n\nWalters Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland, a few months later. Since\n\nthat date the manuscript has been the subject of conservation, imaging\n\nand scholarship, in order to better read the texts. The Archimedes\n\nPalimpsest project, as it is called, has shed new light on Archimedes\n\nand revealed new texts from the ancient world. It has also generated a\n\ngreat deal of public curiosity, as well as the interest of scholars\n\nthroughout the world.\n\n\n\nOn 29th October 2008, we celebrated the ten year anniversary of the\n\nproject. What was erased text, in terrible condition, impossible to\n\naccess, and yet foundational to the history and science of the West,\n\nis now legible, and instantly available for free on the Web. This talk\n\nwill cover the evolution of the project as well as its future\n\ndirections.\n\n\n\nWILLIAM NOEL, Curator of Manuscripts and Rare Books at the Walters Art\n\nMuseum, received his Ph.D. from Cambridge University in England in\n\n1993.  He has served as director of studies in the history of art at\n\nDowning College, Cambridge University, and as Assistant Curator of\n\nManuscripts at The J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles.  Noel is the\n\nauthor of The Harley Psalter (1995), an in-depth investigation into\n\nthe making of an illustrated 11th-century Psalter.  He is also\n\nco-editor and contributor of the exhibition catalogue The Utrecht\n\nPsalter in Medieval Art: Picturing the Psalms of David (1996).  In\n\n2002, together with Prof. Daniel Weiss and Dr. Griffith Mann, he\n\ncurated the exhibition The Book of Kings: Art, War, and the Morgan\n\nLibrary's Medieval Picture Bible.  His recent book, The Oxford Bible\n\nPictures (2004), concerns a series of English miniatures of the\n\n13th-century at the Walters.  Since January 1999, Noel has directed an\n\ninternational program to conserve, image, and study the Archimedes\n\nPalimpsest, the unique source for three treatises by the ancient Greek\n\nmathematician Archimedes (www.archimedespalimpsest.org).  He has\n\nco-written with Prof. Reviel Netz a popular account of the project\n\nentitled The Archimedes Codex (2007).  Will has taught and lectured\n\nwidely.

The policies and processes for providing broad access in the age of the internet are still catching up both to that volume and new technologies. Experiments in public-private partnerships have been tried with varying degrees of success. Even the most successful are burdened with odd limitations and restrictions. A small group of volunteers working directly with the National Archives are trying to change that.\n\nTHOMAS GIDEON  (<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/cmdln\">@cmdln</a>) is an advocate for free software and free culture. He blogs and podcasts about those experiments in digital commons along with technology policy in general, hacktivism, the experience of being an inveterate technology enthusiast and professional, and much more at <em>The Command Line</em>. (<a href=\"http://thecommandline.net/\">http://thecommandline.net</a>)\n\nA continuously updated schedule of talks is also available on the <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/podcast/\"><strong>Digital Dialogues webpage</strong></a>.\n\nUnable to attend the events in person?

The Library, as it has worked to digitize a vast and rich array of primary materials for ever expanding audiences, has not yet had the luxury to consider scholarly enhancements that move beyond mere access. In particular, LC is only beginning to explore the full potential of XML markup--together with creative use of relational databases or similar back-end programming--as an enhancement to research, interpretation, and educational use of its digitized materials. Custom tags within a document might, for example, flag correspondence to LC subject terms, or allow users to sort the contents of a document by theme or topic--that is, to manipulate documents based on conceptual categories that can't be retrieved using conventional search strings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this presentation we will consider three alternatives for the XML markup of a single digitized source, the Civil War diaries of Horatio Nelson Taft, currently presented on the Web at http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/tafthtml/tafthome.html. While exploring the characteristics of these three markup schemes, which we have termed &quot;cultural,&quot;Ã‚Â &quot;literary,&quot; and &quot;library,&quot;Ã‚Â respectively, we raise both practical and theoretical questions. How do we decide what it is we're marking? How much markup is too much? Where does markup end and pure interpretation begin? Can we please every audience at once? These questions provide an opportunity to exchange insights at the early stages of a project designed to push the boundaries of humanities research with the innovative tools of new technology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Acting Director, MITH (mith@umd.edu, 5-5896).",

Traditionally, humanities libraries have been defined by their emphasis on rare materials or special collections.  What are the implications of having an abundant humanities library?\n\n\n\nAs a greater amount of these materials becomes available in digital format, there is growing evidence that humanists might adopt data-driven research or teaching methods that are typically common in the sciences.  The recent \"Digging into Data\" request for proposals represents an example of this new frontier.  The Roman de la Rose Digital Library led by the Johns Hopkins University represents a useful case study in this realm.  Choudhury will discuss the implications of the Rose Digital Library for digital librarians and scholars and offer ideas about how humanists might consider developing and leveraging cyberinfrastructure across domains.\n\n\n\nG. Sayeed Choudhury is the Associate Dean for Library Digital Programs and Hodson Director of the Digital Research and Curation Center at the Sheridan Libraries of Johns Hopkins University. He is also the Director of Operations for the Institute of Data Intensive Engineering and Science (IDIES) based at Johns Hopkins. He is also a Lecturer in the Department of Computer Science at Johns Hopkins, a Research Fellow at the Graduate School of Library and Information Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a Senior Presidential Fellow with the Council on Library and Information Resources.\n\n\n\nChoudhury serves as principal investigator for projects funded through the National Science Foundation, Institute of Museum and Library Services, and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. He has oversight for the digital library activities and services provided by the Sheridan Libraries at Johns Hopkins University. Choudhury has published articles in journals such as the International Journal of Digital Curation, D-Lib, the Journal of Digital Information, First Monday, and Library Trends. He has served on committees for the Digital Curation Conference, Open Repositories, Joint Conference on Digital Libraries, and Web-Wise. He has presented at various conferences including Educause, CNI, DLF, ALA, ACRL, and international venues including IFLA, the Kanazawa Information Technology Roundtable and eResearch Australasia.\n\n\n\nComing up @MITH 3/10:  Project Bamboo: An Open Meeting (facilitated by Neil Fraistat)\n\n\n\nView MITH's complete Digital Dialogues schedule here:\n\n\n\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20100615144914/http://www.mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_spring_2009.pdf\n\n\n\nAll talks free and open to the public!\n\n\n\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-8927).",

CERUZZI\r\r\n\r\r\nThe emergence of a commercialized Internet is a very recent phenomenon. Historians and other scholars have examined its early history, especially its origins in the military-sponsored project ARPANET, named after the Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency. At the other end of the scale, scholars, business journalists, and others have examined the rise and fall of the \"dot.com\" phenomenon, with studies of companies including Amazon, AOL, and Google. What is missing is a study of the transition between the two: how a network funded by taxpayers, and intended for a restricted set of users for restricted purposes, evolved into a worldwide cultural phenomenon, open to all, with almost no restrictions on its use for commercial purposes.\r\r\n\r\r\nThis paper is based on two forthcoming books by the author: one an analysis of the commercialization of the Internet, and the other on the role of northern Virginia as a locus of Internet management and governance.\r\r\n\r\r\nPAUL E. CERUZZI is Curator of Aerospace Electronics and Computing at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum in Washington, DC. His work there includes research, writing, planning exhibits, collecting artifacts, and lecturing on the subjects of microelectronics, computing, and control as they apply to the practice of air and space flight. Dr. Ceruzzi attended Yale University and the University of Kansas, from which received a Ph.D. in American Studies in 1981.\r\r\n\r\r\nHe is the author or co-author of several books on the history of computing and related topics: Reckoners: The Prehistory of The Digital Computer (1983); Smithsonian Landmarks in the History of Digital Computing (1994, with Peggy Kidwell); A History of Modern Computing (1998); and Beyond the Limits: Flight Enters the Computer Age (1989). The latter book was published in connection with an exhibition of the same name at the National Air and Space Museum. He recently co-edited, with James Trefil and Harold Morowitz, the Encyclopedia of Science and Technology (Routledge, 2001), and he is currently working on a history of Systems Integration firms located in the Washington, D.C. region.\r\r\n\r\r\nComing up @MITH 10/16, Brett Bobley (National Endowment for the Humanities): \"A Candid Chat About the NEH's Digital Humanities Initiative\"\r\r\n\r\r\nView MITH's complete Fall Speakers Schedule here:\r\r\n\r\r\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20100615144449/http://www.mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_fall_2007.pdf\r\r\n\r\r\nAll talks free and open to the public!\r\r\n\r\r\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-8927).",

This single family--Mary Shelley was the daughter of Godwin and Wollstonecraft, and the wife of Percy Bysshe--embodies an archetype of British Romanticism: all four struggled in their writings and lives to change the world. Their most important works--Wollstonecraft’s <em>Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em>, Godwin’s <em>Enquiry Concerning Political Justice</em>, P.B. Shelley’s <em>Queen Mab</em>, and <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>, and Mary Shelley’s <em>Frankenstein</em>--received very different degrees of acclaim in their authors’ lifetimes. All, however, have had lasting and profound effects on international culture.\n\nMITH is partnering in this work with the <a href=\"http://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Bodleian Libraries</a> of University of Oxford, the <a href=\"http://www.huntington.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Huntington Library</a>, the <a href=\"http://hcl.harvard.edu/libraries/houghton/\" target=\"_blank\">Houghton Library</a> of Harvard College, the <a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">British Library</a>, and the Carl H. Pforzheimer Collection of Shelley and His Circle at the <a href=\"http://www.nypl.org/\" target=\"_blank\">New York Public Library</a>, which together hold more than an estimated 90% of the known manuscripts. The project aims to create an innovative archival framework constituting a new model of best practices for research libraries wishing to make freely available to the public their manuscript and print holdings. During the three-year initial phase of the project, the project will be including the nearly thirty known Percy Shelley notebooks and his major philosophical poem, <em>Queen Mab</em>, with his extensive reworking; all of the manuscripts for and the first three editions of Mary Shelley’s <em>Frankenstein</em>, along with the first two volumes of Mary Shelley’s journals; the manuscripts of two novels by William Godwin, <em>Fleetwood</em> and <em>Cloudesley</em>; and the ten volumes of <em>Shelley and his Circle</em> with their invaluable research and all the manuscripts contained in those volumes.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.delmas.org/\" target=\"_blank\">The Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation</a> will be supporting the work of a team of encoding specialists to begin work on the<em> Shelley-Godwin Archive </em>materials beginning in January 2012. On behalf of the<em> Shelley-Godwin Archive</em> partners, MITH would like to thank the Delmas Foundation for their generous support.\n\nVisit the <em>Shelley-Godwin Archive</em> at <a href=\"http://www.shelleygodwinarchive.org/\" target=\"_blank\">www.shelleygodwinarchive.org</a>, or follow on Twitter <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/shelleygodwin\" target=\"_blank\">@shelleygodwin</a>.",

    "wp post content": "At the University of Wuerzburg Seminar building, the same place that the TEI Conference Workshops are occurring, the Interedition group is hard at work finishing up prototypes and proofs of concept for our individual projects. Today is the last day for the Bootcamp, although a lot of the members are talking about continuing to hack tomorrow, since the seminar room we reserved remains reserved tomorrow. Some of the group are particularly tired, as there was a late-night hacking session until 1:30am for the third night in a row. To say these people are committed is only putting it lightly.\n\nHowever tired we might be, the effort has paid off. Nick Laiacona has published his work on an SVG text editing application called HumEdit (Github is <a href=\"https://github.com/NickLaiacona/HumEdit\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>). Patrick Cuba (TPEN project) and Bram Buitendijk (<a href=\"http://www.e-laborate.nl/en/\">eLaborate</a>) have done a lot of additional work on top of Nick's HumEdit application, building wrappers and a fancy user interface. The tools uses sample annotation data from Gregor Middel (<a href=\"https://faustedition.uni-wuerzburg.de/dev/project/about\" target=\"_blank\">Faust Edition</a>) and draws overlapping hierarchies of annotations on text. The letters, words, and sentences are compiled individually through SVG on an HTML canvas, and the annotation data is color-coded and layered as underlining shapes that can be dragged. Changing text and dragging annotation markers affects metadata on a remote server storing the annotations. Clearly, this is a very exciting project.\n\nThe Annotation team on which I am on has been no less ambitious. Asaf Bartov has been querying and testing the service implemented by Moritz Wissenbach and Marcos Petris that serves up OAC annotation constraint URLs. The intention for this service is to create valid OAC constraint expressions, as outlined in the OAC Beta Specifications (<a href=\"http://www.openannotation.org/spec/beta/#DM_Constraint\" target=\"_blank\">www.openannotation.org</a>). I myself have been developing a working prototype for a user interface that registers OAC annotations using the services coded by the team (See last post). For those of you who enjoy UML charts, Asaf has made one describing the interaction between OAC server, validation services, and the client-side application (which I'm still working on):\n\n<a href=\"http://www.grantdickie.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/annotationflow.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-203\" alt=\"White board concept for our Annotation service\" src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20111121204849/http://www.grantdickie.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/annotationflow-300x167.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"167\" /></a>\n\nA not very well documented group in these blog posts has been Tara Andrews, Joris Van Zundert, and Troy Griffitts working on developing interoperable microservices through <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20120313072603/http://code.google.com/apis/opensocial/\">Open Social</a>. Tara and Joris have programmed several Humanities tools together and were able, over the Interedition Bootcamp, to fuse them together through the use of Open Social. Troy was able to provide expert consultation on the subject, since he is currently on contract with the University of Muenster Institute for New Testament Text Studies (<a href=\"http://egora.uni-muenster.de/intf/index_en.shtml\">INTF</a>) to assist in developing Open Social Humanities gadgets. So far, the Open Social team at Interedition have been able to publish something online that resembles an interoperable suite of Digital Humanities tools: <a href=\"http://interedition-tools.appspot.com/\">http://interedition-tools.appspot.com/</a> . Very cool.\n\nDoug Reside joined us to assist with coding and has made an encampment over with the people working on HumEdit. Doug is here for the TEI Members Conference and promises to start some serious discussions on the future of TEI at the conference. Professor Fotis Jannidis (<a href=\"https://faustedition.uni-wuerzburg.de/dev/project/about\">Faust Edition</a>), one of the organizers for the TEI conference and member of the Interedition board, also joined us to see about our progress on various projects. Also at the conference tomorrow will be a Think Tank on the ideas of interoperability as defined by Interedition. I myself plan to attend one of the workshops offered by the TEI conference, a \"Introduction to TextGridLab\" that looks to be very thorough.\n\nToday in pictures, I have what I think may be the best shot of the the Maine Castle, or Marineberg, as it is called in German. This was shot from the Mainebruecke, or Maine Bridge, which is one of the oldest bridges in the city that crosses the Maine river.\n\n[fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=\"yes\" overflow=\"visible\"][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=\"1_1\" background_position=\"left top\" background_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" border_color=\"\" border_style=\"solid\" spacing=\"yes\" background_image=\"\" background_repeat=\"no-repeat\" padding=\"\" margin_top=\"0px\" margin_bottom=\"0px\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_direction=\"left\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" center_content=\"no\" min_height=\"none\"][caption id=\"attachment_209\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://www.grantdickie.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/marineberg.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-209\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20111121204850/http://www.grantdickie.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/marineberg-300x210.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"210\" /></a> Castle on the Maine River, Wuerzburg[/caption]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- Grant[/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]",

    "wp post content": "<p style=\"text-align: justify\">I am pleased to report that the first phase of <em><a href=\"http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/\" target=\"_blank\">The Shelley-Godwin Archive</a></em> is now underway. Wenfei (our intrepid intern) and I have begun to create electronic files for our diplomatic transcriptions of Mary Shelley’s <em>Frankenstein</em> and Percy Shelley’s “Esdaile Notebook,” a collection of 58 early poems that remained unpublished until 1964. We are also preparing to encode Shelley’s hand-written revisions to his printed edition of <em>Queen Mab</em>, a portion of which was ultimately published as <em>The Daemon of the World, A Fragment</em> in the <em>Alastor</em> volume.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><a href=\"http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"alignright\" title=\"Shelley_Godwin_Archive\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/sga_screenshot_sm.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"218\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Our encoding schema is based on the <a href=\"http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/P5/\" target=\"_blank\">TEI P5 XML guidelines</a>, which gives us the flexibility to design an innovative framework that will enable end users to collate transcriptions of draft manuscripts with printed editions, to overlay and compare images of various draft states, to search all texts and transcriptions, and to tag text selections with user annotations. In conjunction with the MITH software development team, we strive to create a digital resource that takes into account not only the needs of textual scholars, but also the needs of students and teachers who are interested in learning more about the compositional process and how manuscript sources are brought to and through the press.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">A significant feature of the Archive will be the detail in which we encode physical characteristics of the manuscripts, such as the use of ink or pencil; different hands within the same manuscript item; noting where pages have been damaged, torn out, or inserted; distinguishing among a variety of addition and deletion markings; and cataloging watermarks and other features of a particular manuscript source, to name just a few. These kinds of descriptive details and metadata will enable a broad array of searchable attributes relating to the compositional process that has been difficult, if not impossible, to realize using traditional methods.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">As we continue to think through the kinds of features we want to incorporate into the Archive, we would welcome your thoughts about what you would find most useful when working with manuscript sources in a digital environment. So please feel free to add a comment to this blog entry or send us an email at info&lt;at&gt;shelleygodwinarchive&lt;dot&gt;org. Follow us on Twitter @shelleygodwin. We look forward to your comments and suggestions.</p>",

With this theme we hope to engage a range of issues involving the materiality of texts, including their physical, virtual, or performative manifestations as objects that can decay or break down and can potentially be repaired and sustained over time. It also concerns the processes of inclusion and exclusion through which bodies of texts take shape in the form of editions, archives, collections, and exhibition building, as well as the ethical responsibilities faced by textual scholars, archivists, conservationists, media archeologists, digital resource creators, and cultural heritage professionals engaging in these processes.</span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As always, the conference is open to submissions involving interdisciplinary discussion of current research into particular aspects of textual work: the discovery, enumeration, description, bibliographical analysis, editing, annotation, mark-up, and sustainability of texts in disciplines such as cultural studies, literature, history, musicology, classical and biblical studies, philosophy, art history, legal history, history of science and technology, computer science, library and information science, archives, lexicography, epigraphy, paleography, codicology, cinema studies, new media studies, game studies, theater, linguistics, and textual and literary theory. Considerations of the role of computational methodologies, tools, and technologies in textual theory and practice are of course welcome, as are papers addressing aspects of archival theory and practice as they pertain to textual criticism and scholarly editing. </span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Especially welcome are interdisciplinary papers addressing the theme of Textual Embodiment in the fields of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Black Diaspora Studies, Indigenous Studies, LGBTQ Studies, Latinx Studies, Disability Studies, Women’s Studies, and Critical Theory.</span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Submissions may take the following traditional forms:</span>\n\n<ol>\n\n \t<li><strong>Papers.</strong> Papers should be no more than 20 minutes in length, making a significant original contribution to scholarship. Papers that are primarily reports or demonstrations of tools or projects are discouraged.</li>\n\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>Panels.</strong> Panels may consist of either three associated papers or four to six roundtable speakers. Roundtables should address topics of broad interest and scope, with the goal of fostering lively debate with audience participation.</span></li>\n\n \t<li><strong>Workshops.</strong> Workshops should propose a specific problem, tool, or skill set for which the workshop leader will provide expert guidance and instruction. Examples might be an introduction to forensic computing or paleography. Workshop proposals that are accepted will be announced on the <a href=\"https://textualsociety.org/\">conference Web site</a> and attendees will be required to enroll with the workshop leader(s).</li>\n\n \t<li>Submissions may also take the form of <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishbowl_(conversation)\">Open Fishbowl sessions</a></strong>. Drawing on the expertise of both speakers and attendees, Fishbowls are small group discussions in which 5 initial participants face one another in a circle, in the middle of the larger audience. Participants cycle out as audience members join the inner circle to create dialogue across perspectives and different types of research. Submitted proposals should include a brief statement as to the core idea or theme for the fishbowl, emphasizing its relation to conference themes or relevance to the larger Textual Studies community. Naming some or all of the initial five “fish” is encouraged. Potential topics for Fishbowl session might include, for example, “Minimal Computing, Globalized Editions,” “Participatory Editions,” and “#ArchivesSoWhite.”</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Proposals for all formats should include a title; abstract (250 words max.) of the proposed paper, panel, seminar, or workshop; and name, email address, and institutional affiliation for all participants. Format should be clearly indicated. Seminar, fishbowl, and workshop proposals in particular should take care to articulate the imagined audience and any expectations of prior knowledge or preparation.</span>\n\n\n\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">All abstracts should indicate what if any technological support will be required.</span></i>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Inquiries and proposals should be submitted <a href=\"https://goo.gl/forms/FSTo4GQQrGuM1JLU2\">electronically via this form</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Responses will be sent by March 10.</span>\n\n\n\nAll participants in the STS 2017 conference must be members of STS.

Mellon Foundation, The Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities in the <a href=\"http://www.arhu.umd.edu/\">College of Arts and Humanities</a> at the University of Maryland, <a href=\"http://shiftdesign.org.uk/\">Shift</a>, and the <a href=\"http://mediastudies.virginia.edu/\">Department of Media Studies</a> at the University of Virginia (UVA) will collaborate to lead the ongoing work of the Documenting the Now project. Started in 2014 with a grant to Washington University in St. Louis in partnership with the University of California, Riverside and MITH, <a href=\"https://www.docnow.io\">Documenting the Now</a> is committed to developing tools and community practices that support the ethical collection, use, and preservation of social media and web archives. Continuing the important work the project has accomplished over the past four years, the second phase of Documenting the Now will be focused on three interdependent strands of activity: software development, pedagogy, and engagement with community-based archiving of social justice activism.\n\n\n\nLeading this second phase of Documenting the Now will be <a href=\"https://mith.umd.edu/people/person/trevor-munoz/\">Trevor Muñoz</a>, Interim Director of MITH &amp; Assistant Dean for Digital Humanities Research at UMD who will serve as the Principal Investigator and the Administrative Lead; <a href=\"http://shiftdesign.org.uk/people/bergis-jules/\">Bergis Jules</a>, Director of Equity Initiatives at Shift Design Inc who will serve as a Co-Principal Investigator and the Project Director; <a href=\"https://mediastudies.virginia.edu/people/mdc6j\">Dr. Meredith Clark</a>, Assistant Professor in the Department of Media Studies at UVA who will serve as a Co-Principal Investigator and Academic Lead; and <a href=\"https://mith.umd.edu/people/person/ed-summers/\">Ed Summers</a>, Lead Software Developer at MITH who will be the project’s Technical Lead.\n\n\n\nDuring this phase of the project, our technical work, led by Summers with support from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fromADMwithlove\">Alexandra Dolan-Mescal</a>,  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kayiwa\">Francis Kayiwa</a> and <a href=\"https://mith.umd.edu/people/person/raffaele-viglianti/\">Dr. Raffaele Viglianti</a>, will focus on continuing to develop, test, and deploy the software utilities built during phase one. These tools include <a href=\"https://github.com/docnow/docnow\">DocNow</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.docnow.io/catalog/\">Tweet ID Dataset Catalog</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/docnow/hydrator\">Hydrator</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/docnow/twarc\">Twarc</a>. One of the main focuses for the software that the project team will develop in this phase will be human-centered design approaches that privilege interaction between content creators and users of our tools who are interested in collecting social media data as archival content.\n\n\n\nOne example of work that will exemplify the project's goal to undertake human centered design is Social Humans. Created by Dolan-Mescal, UX and Web Designer for Documenting the Now, <a href=\"https://www.docnow.io/social-humans/\">Social Humans</a> is a set of data labels designed to empower content creators and inform researchers about user intent. In addition to continuing work developing software and fostering a community of practice around social media/web archiving that is grounded in an ethics of care for the histories of oppressed people, the next phase will also see the project team engage in pedagogical activities around social media and race, with the exciting addition of Dr. Meredith Clark as a Co-Principal Investigator. Dr. Clark is a former newspaper journalist whose research focuses on the intersections of race, media, and power. Her work on the project will include the development of academic courses, including a series of experiential learning tasks and assignments using DocNow tools and support. The project team is excited she agreed to join this phase of the effort.\n\n\n\nPhase two will also include work on archiving activism history through a set of community-based archiving workshops. The goal of the program will be to build digital community-based archives in direct partnership with social justice activist organizations. Local activists are usually the people closest to the issues negatively impacting a community and they are most frequently on the front lines agitating for support and offering the most effective solutions, whether their causes are addressing police violence, inadequate educational opportunities, food scarcity, mass incarceration, or racial injustice. The Documenting the Now project is interested in exploring how we might build digital community-based archives from the perspectives of local activists and in equitable partnership with them. The archives will be built on <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://mukurtu.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-href=\"https://mukurtu.org/\">Mukurtu CMS</a> and we’re excited to work with that team because of their commitment to community control of local cultural heritage. Activist groups will be selected to participate in the program through an open application process. We will be sharing more information about the workshops and the application process soon, including incentives for the activist organizations, the workshop team, and the structure of the program. Stay tuned to the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/documentnow\">Documenting the Now Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://news.docnow.io/\">blog</a>, or join our <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf3E7PAXPoT-XoedpEy9UCTpDPS8kPj5JkMwpaWbuqVP0bTrQ/viewform\">Slack</a> for more information.\n\n\n\nMITH, along with our partners, are extremely grateful for the support from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation for Documenting the Now, and for the Foundation’s continued support of cultural heritage work that is intentionally community centered and grounded in an ethic of care for the lived experiences of the most vulnerable people in our society. We are particularly excited for the opportunity that continued support provides for enacting our strategic <a href=\"https://mith.umd.edu/about/values/\">values</a> in combination with the Foundation's support for <a href=\"https://aadhum.umd.edu/\">African American History, Culture and the Digital Humanities (AADHum)</a>.\n\n\n\nThe Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) is a leading digital humanities center that pursues disciplinary innovation and institutional transformation through applied research, public programming, and educational opportunities.

Our goal was to spend two hours working together to link groups and individuals documented in the Southern Poverty Law Center's <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files\">Extremist Files</a> to their respective Twitter accounts in order to:\n\n<ul>\n\n \t<li>assist social media researchers who are studying the ways that these groups are operating online</li>\n\n \t<li>provide an opportunity for folks to respond constructively to the <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/donald-trump-hate-groups-neo-nazi-white-supremacist-racism\">rising</a> <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2016/10/25/there-are-hate-group-leaders-twitter-too\">tide</a> <a href=\"http://www.adl.org/press-center/press-releases/anti-semitism-usa/task-force-report-anti-semitic-harassment-journalists-twitter-2016-campaign.html?ex_cid=newsletter#.WAf7kJMrKRs?referrer=https://t.co/dTL4oXvZgD\">of hate</a> we are witnessing in online and offline spaces</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nWe also had the very practical goal of creating a <a href=\"https://support.twitter.com/articles/20172663\">Twitter block list</a> that would allow you to prevent extremists identified by the SPLC from tweeting into your timeline. This blog post is a quick update to provide some information about how to obtain and use this block list. Look for more information about what we learned in the process of putting this event on in the coming weeks.\n\n\n\nHere's what you need to do to use the block list:\n\n<ol>\n\n \t<li>Right-Click on <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/umd-mith/extremist-files/master/splc-blocklist.csv\">this link to the block list</a> and select <em>Save Link As</em> or your browser's equivalent.</li>\n\n \t<li>Go to your <em>Twitter Settings</em>, select <em>Blocked Accounts</em> in the menu on the left, click <em>Advanced Options</em> and then select <em>Import a List</em> from the dropdown.</li>\n\n \t<li>When you click <em>Attach a file to upload</em> you will prompted to provide the location of the block list file you downloaded.</li>\n\n \t<li>Once you've submitted the file you will see a list of the Twitter accounts present in the block list and have the opportunity to select/deselect them.</li>\n\n \t<li>Click <em>Block.</em></li>\n\n</ol>\n\nHere's a video with a little bit more commentary if you would like to see this process in action before trying it yourself.\n\n\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/188019188?color=afbc21\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Literature_Geek/status/786891713151430657\">Over fifty</a> local and remote participants worked during the two hours in Google Sheets and Slack to link and verify 89 of the 169 individuals and groups present in the Extremist Files. A big thank you to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Literature_Geek\">Amanda Visconti</a> at Purdue (and MITH alum) who quickly got us set up on <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1jI8VUx\">Digital Humanities Slack</a> to provide a place for remote participants to ask questions and coordinate work.\n\n\n\nThe full results of this collaboration can be found in a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LsJHAdSexX4yoYq_Pgfb7XWZgRmBuCcS-7QEETfHxlA/edit\">Google Sheet</a>. As you can see we also ended up attaching Facebook, YouTube, Tumblr and websites where possible. The code for <a href=\"https://github.com/umd-mith/extremist-files/blob/master/crawl.py\">collecting</a> the SPLC data and for <a href=\"https://github.com/umd-mith/extremist-files/blob/master/splc-blocklist.py\">creating the block list</a> from the Google Sheet is <a href=\"https://github.com/umd-mith/extremist-files\">available on Github</a>.\n\n\n\nA few more things about the block list are worth noting in case you end up doing this kind of work yourself. The block list itself must contain Twitter user identifiers (numbers) instead of the Twitter handles. That's why we wrote a program to get the handles from the spreadsheet and fetch the user identifiers from the <a href=\"https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api/users\">Twitter API</a>. We did consider making the block list available using the <a href=\"https://blocktogether.org/\">BlockTogether</a> service, which would allow the list to be shared more easily. However BlockTogether associates the block list with a given user's account, and we didn't want to mix the Extremist Files accounts with our other blocked accounts. Finally, your block list file of numeric identifiers cannot end with a newline or else the Twitter import mechanism gets stuck. At least that was the case when this blog post was written.[/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]",

The public can take a deeper look into the creative process of literature's most iconic texts.\n\n<img class=\"alignleft\" title=\"The first public release of the archive will be the fully transcribed and encoded manuscripts of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein notebooks, with page images provided by the Bodleian Library at Oxford.  \" alt=\"The first public release of the archive will be the fully transcribed and encoded manuscripts of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein notebooks, with page images provided by the Bodleian Library at Oxford.  \" src=\"http://umdrightnow.umd.edu/sites/umdrightnow.umd.edu/files/frankenstein.1831.inside-cover.jpg\" width=\"171\" height=\"280\" />Building on MITH's leadership and innovation in the field of digital humanities, the technology driving the archive provides high-quality, zoomable page images, as well as transcriptions of each page created on the fly from TEI encoding. The first public release of the archive will be the fully transcribed and encoded manuscripts of Mary Shelley's <em>Frankenstein</em> notebooks, with page images provided by the Bodleian Library at Oxford.\n\n\"We encoded each stage of the composition process, tracing the revisionary evolution of primary manuscripts from rough draft to final copy,\" said Neil Fraistat director of MITH and an eminent Shelley scholar. \"The added value here is far greater than basic transcription that only displays text as it appears on the page without embedded contextual information.\"\n\nUsers will search and see for themselves insertions, deletions, shifts in hand, and other variables related to the composition process. Future archive releases will encourage \"participatory digital humanities,\" which aims to provide web-based tools that help the archive function as a work-site for scholars, students, and the general public. Contributions will come in the form of transcriptions, corrections, annotations, and TEI encoding.\n\n\"This website is an excellent illustration of research in the humanities,\" said Bonnie Thornton Dill, UMD's dean of the College of Arts and Humanities. \"The archive illuminates complexities in <em>Frankenstein</em> with regard to gender and the digitization makes this information visible and accessible to a wide range of scholars and interested people.\"\n\nThe archive was made possible by a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities and was created in partnership with the Bodleian Libraries of the University of Oxford and the New York Public Library's Carl H. Pforzheimer Collection of Shelley and His Circle.\n\nTo learn more about the Shelley-Godwin Archive, visit <a href=\"http://shelleygodwinarchive.org\">shelleygodwinarchive.org</a> on the evening of Thursday, October 31, 2013 when the site is scheduled to launch.\n\n<strong>Public Launch on October 31, 2013 in NYC</strong>\n\nTo celebrate the launch, the New York Public Library will host a free public program on October 31 at 6 p.m. in the Margaret Berger Forum at The New York Public Library's Stephen A. Schwarzman Building at Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street.  On hand will be <a title=\"Neil Fraistat\" href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/people/person/neil-fraistat/\">Neil Fraistat</a> and <a title=\"David Brookshire\" href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/people/person/david-brookshire/\">David Brookshire</a> from MITH, who will discuss the creation of the archive's first transcribed and encoded manuscript, the Bodleian Library's <em>Frankenstein </em>Notebooks of Mary Shelley. Elizabeth Denlinger, curator of The New York Public Library's Carl H. Pforzheimer Collection of Shelley and His Circle, will give a brief overview of the archive's generation and birth. Charles Robinson of the University of Delaware will give a more extended talk on the novel's composition, illustrating how the Shelley-Godwin Archive functions in real time. Treasures from the Pforzheimer Collection will be  specially shown this evening only, including the 1818 first edition of <em>Frankenstein</em>, the first illustrated edition of 1831, playbills from early stage productions of <em>Frankenstein</em>, a 1931 edition showing photographs from the James Whale film, as well as original manuscripts from both Mary Shelley and Percy Bysshe Shelley.

    "wp post content": "After several hours of hacking away, we've decided to head out for food and drinks. I have to say it is an experience to stay in a fancy hotel lounge and see the looks of hotel guests as they pass by the table of DH hackers and their laptops. There was much progress made by both sides of the table at the bootcamp. Nick Laiacona has implemented an HTML canvas to mimic typing text on the screen and is still working away at it. So far on the Annotation side, we're 60% complete with developing the back end RESTful service for registering and querying OAC-spec annotations. Two of the Annotation members from the University of Madrid started implementing the front end wrapper using the GWT library, while I'm using MITHGrid to do the same. Whatever the outcome, I think this experimental work can benefit a lot of the OAC annotation work we're doing back at MITH.\n\nTomorrow we're planning an outing to the Residenz, a local palace, wine cellar, and botanical garden. Many more pictures to follow!",

These kinds of dynamic interfaces are what end users are starting to expect of their interactions. Trevor Owens, digital archivist at the National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program (NDIIPP) in the Office of Strategic Initiatives at the Library of Congress and a doctoral student in the Graduate School of Education at George Mason University,  will open a discussion of the way these kinds of interfaces change the way curators, librarians, archivists, researchers and general public see materials in these collections. To ground this discussion in a concrete example, the presentation will focus on one NDIIPP project, Recollection. Recollection is  a free platform built by Zepheira LLC for the Library of Congress which empowers historians, librarians, archivists and curators to create and customize views, (interactive maps, timelines, facets, tag clouds) of digital collections. The demonstration will show how the software can import collections from spreadsheets or MODS records, augment and transform that data online, generate distinct interactive visual interfaces, and ultimately copy-paste to embed the interfaces they design in any webpage. The discussion of this specific tool will serve as a place to ground a broader general discussion of the possibilities and implications of these kinds of dynamic interfaces to collections.\n\nTREVOR OWENS is a digital archivist at the National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program (NDIIPP) in the Office of Strategic Initiatives at the Library of Congress and a doctoral student in the Graduate School of Education at George Mason University. He is interested in online communities, games and learning, and digital tools and practices for humanities scholarship.\n\nAll talks free and open to the public! Refreshments are often provided but attendees are welcome to bring their own lunches.\n\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (http://mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-8927).",

HILDY\n\nTheatre Finder is a comprehensive online guide of all theatres world-wide that are over 100 years old. Collaboratively edited and peer reviewed, it has been designed for both tourist and scholarly audiences. The project combines 25 years of research by two-time MITH fellow, Prof. Franklin J. Hildy of the School of Theatre, Dance, and Performance Studies, with the technical and design expertise of the MITH staff. Theatre Finder is intended to serve as the test platform for CAMP, a Collaborative, Ajax-Based, Modeling Platform, developed separately at MITH with funding from an NEH Level II Digital Humanities Startup Grant. This talk will examine the relationship between content and collaboration, both in terms of the development of content with international scholars and in terms of the relationship between content development and technology support.\n\nFRANKLIN J. HILDY is Professor and Director of Graduate Studies in the Department of Theatre at University of Maryland. He is author of Shakespeare at the Maddermarket: Nugent Monck and the Norwich Players (1986), editor of New Issues in the Reconstruction of Shakespeare's Theatre (1990), co-author, with Oscar G. Brockett of 4 editions of History of the Theatre and over 50 articles on a wide range of topics, including the history of efforts to reconstruct the theatres of Shakespeare’s day. He as severed as an advisor to Shakespeare’s Globe, London since 1984 and has been a consultant on numerous reconstruction attempts in the United States.\n\nAll talks free and open to the public!\n\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (http://mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-8927).",

One of the tools we’re exploring is Weka, a collection of machine-learning algorithms that can be used to mine data-sets. MITH has helped us design and construct our database, which contains thousands of articles about Russian authors featured in American literary magazines written during the 1920s). Each article in the database is associated with values indicating the frequency of words in the text, so we can trace how often a single word (unigram) like “revolution” appears throughout our articles, or how often two words appear next to each other (a bigram), such as “Russian revolution”. Both these features offer us paths to think about our dataset in terms of describing and quantifying word proximity.\n\nMITH's Travis Brown demonstrated how we could use Weka to train a machine learning classifier that could assign labels to articles in the dataset we had not ever read. To test this, we created a smaller training dataset of just 150 articles, a number small enough that we could actually read through the entire texts and manually describe by answering questions ranging from “Is a given literary author a subject of debate in this article?” to “Is radical politics an issue in the article?”. Given these measures, Weka has the ability to classify every other article in our dataset with some degree of accuracy.\n\nWeka provided us with a decision tree that classifies answers to the question “Is literary style and artistry an issue in this article” appropriately for approximately 67% of our training set. This success rate can be improved as we add new measures for classifying and quantifying the text. One direction we can go is to attempt to use MALLET—“an integrated collection of Java code useful for statistical natural language processing [fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=\"yes\" overflow=\"visible\"][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=\"1_1\" background_position=\"left top\" background_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" border_color=\"\" border_style=\"solid\" spacing=\"yes\" background_image=\"\" background_repeat=\"no-repeat\" padding=\"\" margin_top=\"0px\" margin_bottom=\"0px\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_direction=\"left\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" center_content=\"no\" min_height=\"none\"][and] document classification”—in order to create topics—groups of words that MALLET finds to be significantly thematically related. Topic modeling is fascinating because a preliminary examination of generated topics has already provided us with a variety of distinct themes and vocabulary appearing in our dataset, ranging from religion to specific Russian authors. We’re in the process of running Weka’s classification system on those generated topics that include religious language in order to answer another of our questions—”Is religion an issue in the article?”.\n\nOur current Weka experiments, using a smaller training set of 46 articles, have already acquired promising results. For example, when using the J48 decision tree algorithm on our textual data filtered into unigrams, Weka correctly classifies 76% of our documents when answering the “Is politics an issue?” question. If we filter our data into both unigrams and bigrams, the correct classification rate decreases to 67%. However, if we filter our data into unigrams and apply a stemmer (which breaks down words into their root forms and ignores prefixes and suffixes), our correct classification rate increases to 77%.\n\nWe are looking forward to expanding our experiments to apply to an even larger subset of our data, as we continue to learn more about natural language processing tools in the coming weeks.[/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]",

Thanks to Kirsten Keister for setting up the light box format to view the samples. The examples include two samples of work that processes more than one text (collation, synopsis) and a number of examples of manuscripts.\n\n<strong>The Project</strong>\nI’ve been working on two issues. One is pointing. I now have a complete set of pointers from the reference file (ref.xml) to the witness files for locating spans of damaged text and page and fragment beginnings and ends for fragmentary texts. Of course, because nothing is simple, the direction of all of these will have to be reversed, so that the individual witnesses point into the reference text.\nIn addition, I’ve improved the tokenization process, so that I can process “rich” tokens, retaining data about the word in question (e.g., that it is an abbreviation, or deleted ….; hold a regularized spelling as well as the original) as well as simple tokens, and re-join a collation based on simple tokens with the complex tokens.\n\n<strong>Text Geek Heaven</strong>\nAlong the way, I’ve discovered some joining Genizah fragments. The coolest by far on a technical, jigsaw-puzzle level is the four-way join between TS AS 78.69, TS AS 78.162, TS AS 78.235 and TS NS 329.286 (Cambridge). The four fragments adjoin yet another, TS E2.71.

Are digital historians simply public historians working in a new environment? Recently, digital humanists have struggled to find a definition of the field that is sufficiently broad to encompass the goals and methodologies of practitioners from a variety of fields including literary studies, geography, archeology, media studies, classics, and history. Given these disciplinary differences, practitioners approach data and digital tools with different kinds of inquiry questions. Digital historians can draw on the thirty year tradition of public history, which emphasizes collaboration and public engagement. At the same time, they have access to the work of cognitive scientists, who have developed an increasingly sophisticated understanding of the way that people learn history. In combination, these influences yield a version of digital work—“Doing history in public”—that places inquiry questions front and center. This talk will explore the implications of scientific work and the ways that it can clarify the place of digital history within the larger landscape of the digital humanities.\n\nSharon M. Leon is Director of Public Projects and Research Assistant Professor. Her research interests include the history of religion in the U.S., especially Roman Catholicism, history of science, and twentieth century cultural history. She received her bachelor's degree from Georgetown University and her doctorate in American Studies at the University of Minnesota in 2004. Her book manuscript on US Catholics and the Eugenics Movement is forthcoming from the University of Chicago Press, and her work has appeared in Church History and the Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences. At CHNM, Leon has worked on World History Matters (worldhistorymatters.org), ECHO (echo.gmu.edu), and the Teaching American History Grants (chnm.gmu.edu/tah/). She directs the Center's work on Historical Thinking Matters (historicalthinkingmatters.org), The Object of History (objectofhistory.org), the Bracero History Archive (braceroarchive.org), and Martha Washington: A Life (marthawashington.us). Finally, Leon co-directs Omeka (omeka.org) and the National History Education Clearinghouse (teachinghistory.org).\n\nComing up @ MITH April 20th: Mirona Magearu (Comparative Literature), “Performance in Digital Poetry: Technique, Spectacle, and Representation of Cultural Intersections.\n\nView MITH's complete Fall Speakers Schedule here:\n\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20100608231200/http://www.mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_spring_2010.pdf\n\nAll talks free and open to the public!\n\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-8927).",

    "wp post content": "Dear all,\n\nIt is my great pleasure to share with you the news that Doug Reside has just been promoted from Assistant to Associate Director of MITH in recognition of the superb work he has done since arriving here in 2006.\n\nAs many of you know, Doug is one of those rare humanities scholars who also has a degree in computer science.  During the past three and a half years as assistant director of MITH, he has supervised all of our technical work while also serving as our lead programmer. At the same time, he has written a series of successful and important grants, helping us to establish an international profile in digital tool building and in the nexus of the digital humanities and the performing arts. His multimedia XML markup tool AXE has already been at the center of three recent grants; two from NEH and one from Mellon, and he was responsible for the technical design and management of the Shakespeare Quartos Archive, a project supported by an NEH/JISC grant, with the Folger Shakespeare Library, the British Library, and the Bodleian Library as our partners.\n\nDoug is currently in the midst of both a grant project and a book on the digital curation and preservation of musical theatre.  In joining Matt Kirschenbaum as an associate director of MITH, Doug will oversee all of MITH's operations and supervise MITH's new assistant director Dave Lester.\n\nNeil",

In this talk, Professor Mills Kelly, Associate Director of the Center for History and New Media, will discuss the results of a recent course he taught called \"Lying About the Past\" in which his students created an online historical hoax that fooled a fair number of people (including several professors). Along the way the students worked harder than any group of students he's taught in more than a dozen years in the college classroom. What lessons can we learn about teaching and digital culture from his experiences? Come to the talk and find out.\n\n\n\n T. Mills Kelly is Associate Dean for Enrollment Development at George Mason University, where he is also an Associate Director of the Center for History and New Media and an Associate Professor in the Department of History and Art History. His conventional training is in East European history and he is the author of one book and many articles in that specialty. His unconventional training is in history and pedagogy as they happen in the digital world. In that capacity he has been the co-director or PI of several major NEH-funded web projects in history and is the author of numerous articles and several book chapters on the intersection of digital media and historical pedagogy.

I neglected to post it at the time it was written--sorry, Jennie!</em>\n\n<em>The following post was written by PoliProc members <strong>Robin Pike</strong> and<strong> Joanne Archer.</strong></em>\n\nThe Born-Digital Working Group, Policies and Procedures subgroup, has spent February examining the changes we will need to make to existing policies to accommodate born digital material. The goal of the subgroup over the course of the next few months is to:\n<ul>\n\t<li>examine current Special Collections policies such as collection development policies, donor agreements, and the UM processing manual</li>\n\t<li>review policies that consider born-digital or electronic media at other institutions, especially within the AIMS project</li>\n\t<li>create modular policies and agreements for the UMD Libraries that consider born-digital media</li>\n\t<li>identify the input we will need from the Administrative and Tools subgroups that will determine the content of some of the policies.</li>\n</ul>\n<b><b>\n</b></b>Special Collections does not currently have an overarching collections policy. Instead each subject area within special collections has smaller, separate policies, none of which specifically address collecting born-digital material. Our subgroup will develop a policy for born digital material that will provide Special Collections staff who are working with donors a clear understanding of our capability to provide long term stewardship of digital material. It will also give guidance on the type of information that should be gathered at the early stages of donor development.  We expect that we will draw heavily on the born-digital sections of other institutions’ existing policies.\n\nExamining the existing donor agreements at first glance seems to be the most straightforward aspect of our work. Special Collections uses a standardized deed of gift form which is modular in format and takes into account various rights, privacy, and use restrictions. We plan to add points and revise current statements to consider born-digital media. However, some of the questions we need to reflect in the donor agreements include how born-digital material will be transferred or captured, donors’ preference in terms of files previously deleted but recovered in the transfer process to the library, the scope of what we can provide in terms of preservation of the born-digital material, and specific conditions on access to materials. Although the donor agreement seemed the easiest place to start it become clear that establishing what we can and are willing to collect (i.e. the collection policy) is the critical first step for this group. It’s also clear that we need to work closely with our tools group to understand what will be technically feasible at the University of Maryland.\n\nWhile part of the scope of this group will be making changes to the Special Collections Processing Manual it is already clear that this will happen much later down the road once the tools group has made recommendations for ingesting and accessing born digital materials.\n\nFortunately, we are not the first to begin work on these issues and we will be relying heavily on the work of other institutions. Our first steps are to examine the following resources:<b><b></b></b>\n\n&nbsp;\n<ul>\n\t<li>AIMS Born-Digital Collections: An Inter-Institutional Model for Stewardship, January 2012 (<a href=\"http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/aims/whitepaper/AIMS_final.pdf\">http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/aims/whitepaper/AIMS_final.pdf</a>)</li>\n\t<li>SAA Campus Case Studies</li>\n\t<li>SAA E-records listserv (for examples/templates)</li>\n</ul>\n<b id=\"internal-source-marker_0.0071594929322600365\">\n</b>The BDWG has started it’s work in earnest at this point and it’s the questions we need to answer are becoming more clear. Our FRED (Forensic Recovery of Evidence Device) has arrived so soon we will be able to start thinking more concretely about workflows and procedures.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;",

    "wp post content": "Scholarly editor Gary Taylor has asked: “How can you love a work, if you don’t know it? How can you know it, if you can’t get near it? How can you get near it, without editors?” Scholarly editors and other textual scholars are an integral part of the continuum that keeps the stories of the past understood by the present—but just as important is the <i>you</i>, that public of not just scholars, but also readers beyond the academy whose interest keeps the humanities alive and relevant.\n\nAs a web developer and textual scholar, I'm interested in improving interfaces to digital humanities projects: can we design for a more public conversation? MITH is supporting my dissertational <a href=\"http://dr.amandavisconti.com/\"><i>Infinite </i>Ulysses</a> project, for which I've built a participatory digital edition of James Joyce's difficult but rewarding novel <i>Ulysses. </i>The website creates a community for discussing the text; users can highlight sections of the text to add a comment, question, or interpretation, as well as read, upvote, and tag others' annotations. A variety of sorting, filtering, and toggling options customize the experience to an individual reader's needs, whether that reader knows Church Latin, wants to avoid spoilers, needs extra help as a first-time reader, or is a scholar studying <i>Ulysses</i>' puzzles or the function of written material (letters, poems, etc.) throughout the novel.\n\nBesides this design and coding work, I'll conduct user testing to gauge the <a href=\"http://literaturegeek.com/2012/11/03/the3us\" target=\"_blank\">use, usefulness, and usability</a> of the edition. Digital editions are a key humanities scholarly form, but often we don't base our understanding of how they are read and used on data gathered through formal user testing. This project builds on <a href=\"http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/71380\" target=\"_blank\">my master's thesis work</a> at the University of Michigan School of Information, where I explored user testing for the digital humanities, and how digital archives and editions might be designed to include a public audience.\n\nI'll assess the digital edition site itself, looking at how features drawn from existing, successful online communities that deal with quantity and quality of text (such as Reddit and StackExchange) port to digital humanities platforms. I'll also use test and analytics data to support the speculative design of the edition as an \"infinite\" <em>Ulysses</em> conversation. Could the site still produce customized reading experiences while storing an \"infinite\" quantity of annotations of various quality? What happens to complex texts—especially those authored to be hypertextual, chaotic, and encyclopedic, like <i>Ulysses</i>—when a participatory digital edition places them under \"infinite\" annotations and conversations? Data on reading behavior—such as what pages of the book take users the longest to read, or receive the most annotations, or the most contentious (both up- and down-voted) annotations—will give me a basis to speculate on questions like these.\n\nI'm finishing up private alpha-testing of the site this month. Beta-testing with individual volunteers will begin at the start of January, with group testing (teachers/students, book clubs) following at the end of the month. To sign up as an Infinite Ulysses beta-tester, share your Ulysses annotations, or inquire about using Infinite Ulysses in your classroom or book club this January, please <a href=\"http://goo.gl/qtcy6\" target=\"_blank\">fill out this form</a>!\n\nI'm grateful to MITH for their support—I'm working this academic year as MITH's Winnemore Digital Dissertation Fellow, allowing me to focus full-time on the project's various deliverables. The dissertation takes a unique non-monograph form, consisting of the <em>Infinite</em> Ulysses participatory digital edition (plus a public code repository and documentation on using my code to create your own participatory digital edition); user testing, site analytics, and analysis; and regular research blogging culminating in a scholarly article final draft.

In the ten years since its founding, MITH has become internationally recognized as one of the leading digital humanities centers in the world. As the host of the 2009 Digital Humanities conference and the co-organizer of centerNet (an international network of similar centers), MITH is one of the centers at the heart of the now burgeoning international field of digital humanities.\n\n\n\nMITH is generously supported by the University administration and enjoys productive collaborations with allied campus units, including the University Libraries, the College of Information Science, and the Human Computer Interaction Lab. Geographically situated within the Washington DC Beltway, MITH is perfectly positioned for its frequent collaborations with the world-class libraries, museums, and cultural institutions in the metropolitan area, but our partnerships have also extended around the world. Recent projects include a collaboration with several major libraries in the U.K. and the United States to create an online archive of all extant pre-1642 quartos of Shakespeare&apos;s plays and participation on a national research team charged by the Library of Congress with the preservation of virtual worlds (e.g. Adventure, DOOM, and Second Life). This latter project is part of MITH&apos;s larger focus on the preservation of born digital creative work, also represented by our hosting of the Electronic Literature Organization and the Deena Larsen Collection--one of the world&apos;s largest publicly held collections of electronic literature.\n\n\n\nThe Assistant Director will bear primary responsibility for project management and oversight of all MITH projects, including creation of deadlines for all deliverables and project tracking; the supervision of MITH&apos;s development team, that includes programmers, web designers, graduate assistants, and interns; and computer programming services, data, and application architecture design and modeling for MITH projects. We are therefore seeking a web programmer experienced with web scripting languages (JavaScript, PHP, Ruby) and with some knowledge of compiled languages (Java, C++). Ability to work with Unix/Linux based applications is required, and preference will be given to candidates with database and XML expertise. Strong organizational and project management skills are also mandatory, as are excellent communication skills. A humanities background is especially desirable. Bachelor&apos;s degree required; MA, MLS, or Ph.D. preferred.\n\n\n\nThe Assistant Director is a full-time, 12-month staff position at the University. Salary is commensurate with experience, ranging from $51,304-$64,131. The University also offers a competitive benefits package. To apply, please send a letter of application, CV, and contact information for three references to Doug Reside, Search Chair, via email: dreside@umd.edu. For best consideration, apply by close of business on October 9, 2009. The University of Maryland actively subscribes to a policy of equal employment opportunity and will not discriminate against any employee or applicant because of race, age, gender, color, sexual orientation, physical or mental disability, religion, national origin, or political affiliation. Women and Minorities are strongly encouraged to apply.",

The $30,000 award will support development of a tool called the Ajax XML Encoder (AXE) by Assistant Director <strong>DOUG RESIDE</strong> and a team. Work will begin in September.\r\n\r\n\"The Ajax XML encoder, with its intuitive Web-based interface, will come as a breath of fresh air to those who have previously been frustrated by text-centric tagging tools which require an expert knowledge of mark-up languages,\" said Reside. Since the codification of the Text Encoding Initiative standards in the mid-1990s, the process of the creation of digital editions and archives is largely one of \"marking up\" existing artifacts in SGML or XML.  Originally, this was often done \"by hand,\" with scholars adding XML tags to existing text documents using a text editor.  Over the last decade several tools have been produced that make this process somewhat more efficient and accurate, though most still require more than a beginner's familiarity with XML encoding, and few are open source.  Moreover, many digital humanities projects have, of late, become far more multi-medial--relying on image, video, and audio files as well as text.  Existing markup tools have only begun to work with these non-textual artifacts.  As digital archives continue to grow, the markup tools used to encode them must become more flexible and easier to use.\r\n\r\nThe Ajax XML Encoder (AXE) is intended to meet this need for a flexible, open source, multimedia tagging tool suitable for use by the non-specialist.  MITH Director, Neil Fraistat, noted that \"AXE will allow users with limited technical skills to tag text, images, video, and audio files deeply for inclusion in digital archives.\"  Like the mythological Ajax's axe, MITH's AXE is intended to provide users with enough power and flexibility to accomplish their tasks without a great deal of assistance from the technical \"gods.\"",

Decisions have to be made about what to keep and what to discard; these decisions encode and reflect particular values, privilege and power structures—some decisions about what to be kept go against the community’s desire for privacy or restricted access to materials; this is a tension between surveillance and privacy, between visibility and erasure. Yvonne Perkins writes, “In the past people such as women, non-Europeans, Aborigines, the poor etc were not considered important contributors to our history so their stories are often not portrayed in archival records, or they were obscured in the archives by the social conventions of the time.”\n\n\n\nArchives—in this usage I mean institutional, community, as well as digital collections curated by scholars—do not only exist to explain or contextualize the past, but also signal towards and shape futures. Archives call to the fore the processes of preservation, memory, and access. As Brit Stolli notes, attending to these processes raises uncomfortable questions of who decides what is significant to carry forward, in whose memory is the past best preserved, how do we (and who exactly counts as ‘we’) determine the ethical framework through which to focus our efforts of preservation and future-shaping? Absences and obfuscations are referred to as archival silences. Michel-Rolph Trouillot outlines the ways voices from the past are silenced:\n\n<ul>\n\n \t<li>there is a silencing in the making of sources. Which events even get described or remembered in a manner which allows them to transcend the present in which they occurred? Not everything gets remembered or recorded. Some parts of reality get silenced.</li>\n\n \t<li>there is a silencing in the creation of archives—in this usage, Trouillot means repositories of historical records. At times this archival silencing is permanent since the records do not get preserved; other times the silencing is in the process of competition for the attention of the narrators, the later tellers of the historical tales.</li>\n\n \t<li>And thirdly, the narrators themselves necessarily silence much. In most of history the archives are massive. Choices, selections, valuing must be done. In this process, huge areas of archival remains are silenced.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThese silences occur along a spectrum of accidental to intentional, from the creation of records, to the identification of such records as valuable (value set within formal, institutional repositories reflect the needs of the state and those who hold structural power), to the resources to preserve and carry forward records, and to the ways in which records are described, catalogued, and organized.\n\n\n\nFurther, silencing can occur as sites of sources and records are suppressed, lost, damaged or destroyed through climate change.\n\n\n\nI have been backing into a definition of archives, the Society for American Archivists defines archives as:\n\n<ol>\n\n \t<li>Materials created or received by a person, family, or organization, public or private, in the conduct of their affairs and preserved because of the enduring value contained in the information they contain or as evidence of the functions and responsibilities of their creator, especially those materials maintained using the principles of provenance, original order, and collective control; permanent records.</li>\n\n \t<li>The professional discipline of administering such collections and organizations.</li>\n\n \t<li>The building (or portion thereof) housing archival collections.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nWhat this definition obscures are the variety of non-institutional, community archives and collections of digital sources curated by scholars for a particular research question or goal (many projects in the digital humanities). Further, the SAA definition understates the extremely nuanced and value-ladened decisions that drive how archives identify materials and process those materials for public use. From an archivist view, archives are repositories which collect unique and rare materials from outside sources through donation or purchase based on specific collecting goals, and makes these materials accessible via a series of practices that range from organization/arrangement, naming, and describing materials, as well as decisions regarding access and privacy—with documentation of these decisions often not easily accessible by researchers/users of archival collections. It sidesteps the construction of pasts and futures as well as the processes in which those pasts and futures are navigated and imagined through a seemingly neutral stance.\n\n\n\nAs Mario Ramirez writes, “continued assertions of neutrality and objectivity, and a rejection of the ‘political,’ take for granted an archival subject that is not only homogeneous (free of racial stereotypes, societal influence, prejudice, and political opinions), but that also supports whiteness and white privilege in the profession and within archival holdings.” I lean on Michelle Caswell’s observation that what is constructed as ‘neutral’ is a matter of perspective, and such perspectives remain limited given the homogeneity of the archival field.\n\n\n\nThere is an inherent violence in archival work--silencing and obscuring of people and sources, creating and sustaining hierarchies through collection practices that value some voices and experiences over others, through naming practices, controlled vocabularies, and description, as well as  hiding/devaluing the labor involved in this work. Terry Cook emphasizes from the ancient world to the present women (and people of color, LGBT communities, and other non-white, heteronormative, able-bodied people) have been de-legitimized in archival processes.\n\n\n\nHow can we deconstruct this silencing and archival violence, to build an anti-violent, anti-racist, woman-ist practice instead? Within this reflective, critical archival work, how do concerns of climate change put pressure on—and reshape—this striving for practice?\n\n\n\nThe term Anthropocene signals the current moment of mass extinctions and climate change resulting from human activities.  But as Donna Haraway suggests it is both too big and too small. It posits a ‘universal’, in her words ‘as if it’s humanity or man that did this thing (meaning environmental damage), without connecting this damage to the processes of building wealth through extermination and extraction of animals, peoples, and natural resources. Haraway suggests the term capitalocene to better situate human activities within the robust networks of animals and plants, and within timescales of near and distant pasts and futures.\n\n\n\nFor this talk, I am using the more familiar Anthropocene, while drawing on the messier networks and timescales of capitalocene, holding on to the troubling notion of a ‘universalism.’ My usage intends to focus on the social, political, and economic pressures that are connected or result from the process of extermination and extraction of resources. These processes displace millions of people, leading to an even greater pressure on the records and sites of memory and heritage.\n\n\n\nAs scholars, digital practitioners, and librarians and archivists, striving for a more just practice for collecting, describing, and stewarding the sources of cultural memory, I lean on David Wallace’s outline of a social justice approach to archives, which “embrac[es] ambiguity over clarity; accept[s] that social memory is always contestable and reconfigurable; understand[s] that politics and political power is always present in shaping social memory; consider[s] that archives and archival praxis always exist within contexts of power; … recognize[s] the paradox of archives and archivists as loci of both weak social power and significant social memory shaping potential; and acknowledge[s] that social justice itself is ambiguous and contingent on dissimilar space, time and cultural contexts.”\n\n\n\nWith this in mind, I am going to pivot to a reflection on an approach to digital work that Jeremy Boggs, of the Scholar’s Lab at University of Virginia, and I have called Advocacy by Design.\n\n\n\nIn 2014, the disappearance and murder of University of Virginia undergraduate Hannah Graham, the Rolling Stone ‘After a Rape’ article, and the assault of African American student leader, Martese Johnson, by two Alcoholic Beverage Control agents led to the development of Advocacy by Design. The cries of ‘how could this happen here?’ and ‘we had no idea!’ were discordant with the long history of sexual and racial violence at UVa.\n\n\n\nTogether with Professor Lisa Goff, the Scholars’ Lab team organized a digital archive to document this history at the university. Jeremy and I felt the archive must be feminist at the core, that feminist principles must be present at each stage-from collecting materials, to describing and organizing metadata, to the interface, to the ways in which the archive was shared. While we continued to work on Take Back the Archive, we felt this feminist mode of working could be extend to other projects.\n\n\n\nAdvocacy by Design articulates a shared understanding and practice that fronts questions of how people are represented in, or are subjects of, academic work; questions of who reads and uses our work as well as those who collaborate and contribute to our work. We articulate this advocacy through particular stances on a number of interrelated concepts, we call principles. Some principles are borrowed from Shaowen Bardzell’s Feminist HCI: Taking Stock and Outlining an Agenda for Design, while others grew out of our experiences with Take Back the Archive.\n\n\n\n[/fusion_text][fusion_imageframe image_id=\"19434\" style_type=\"none\" stylecolor=\"\" hover_type=\"none\" bordersize=\"\" bordercolor=\"\" borderradius=\"\" align=\"center\" lightbox=\"yes\" gallery_id=\"gallery\" lightbox_image=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Principles-Elements.png\" alt=\"Principles &amp; Elements\" link=\"\" linktarget=\"_self\" hide_on_mobile=\"small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_direction=\"left\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_offset=\"\"]http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Principles-Elements-980x612.png[/fusion_imageframe][fusion_separator style_type=\"none\" hide_on_mobile=\"small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility\" class=\"\" id=\"\" sep_color=\"\" top_margin=\"10px\" bottom_margin=\"10px\" border_size=\"\" icon=\"\" icon_circle=\"\" icon_circle_color=\"\" width=\"\" alignment=\"center\" /][fusion_text]These principles include within them components and elements, such metadata, project management, and licenses, to better apply principles throughout a research inquiry. Advocacy is active—an attention-based practice of asking what are we doing to foster diverse voices? What do these practices look like face-to-face? What do they look like in the things we design, build, share?\n\n\n\nElements are ways to make visible the principles within our workflows, interactions, and research products.\n\n\n\nAdvocacy by Design is not proscriptive, not a checklist, rather a way of practicing that invites return and reflection upon the why and how of our work.\n\n\n\nWhen thinking about archives in the Anthropocene, the principles of transparency, stewardship, poly-vocalism, and ethics of care emerge as a way to enact or reflect a justice-or advocacy-based approach to archival practice.\n\n<ul>\n\n \t<li>Transparency, meaning what is collected, by whom, why, and how clearly is that communicated to readers/users?</li>\n\n \t<li>Stewardship: Traditional archives have a mission to preserve materials in perpetuity</li>\n\n \t<li>Preservation and archival ownership are different than stewardship, which stresses the care of materials, and this care should include care for the people represented within those materials</li>\n\n \t<li>Poly-vocalism, which resists a single narrative and seeks to open pathways for many points of view and many points of engagement with sources.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nCarol Gilligan writes, \"The ethics of care starts from the premise that as humans we are inherently relational, responsive beings and the human condition is one of connectedness or interdependence. As an ethic grounded in voice and relationships, in the importance of everyone having a voice, being listened to carefully (in their own right and on their own terms) and heard with respect.\" For Gilligan, a feminist ethic of care is an ethic of resistance to the injustices inherent in patriarchy (meaning the association of care and caring with women rather than with humans, the feminizing of care work, as well as the rendering of care as less important, though linked with, justice).\n\n\n\nRicky Punzalan and Michelle Caswell ask “What happens when we begin to think of record keepers and archivists as caregivers, bound to records creators, subjects, and users through a web of mutual responsibility?” How does this shift our collaborations with communities, scholars, archivists, and record keepers? How does an ethic of care shift how we collect, analyze, and prioritize records?\n\n\n\nEthics of Care provides a way to think through our responses and responsibilities and position the human condition as one of connectedness, one of interdependence, which echo’s Donna Haraway’s call for us to recognize and honor the interconnections among people, plants, animals, and the planet in an effort to create, foster, and defend places of refuge. Haraway’s play with responsibilities and being response able are helpful touchstones for thinking about archives in the Anthropocene.\n\n\n\nI want to share three quick example of principles and elements in an existing project. Documenting the Now does a fantastic job at communicating technical infrastructure and project decisions through a variety of platforms, from newsletters to a Slack Channel to GitHub, all elements of transparency.\n\n\n\nFurther, <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/research/documenting-the-now-supporting-scholarly-use-and-preservation-of-social-media-content/\">Documenting the Now</a> builds tools alongside the community of activists, scholars, researchers, and interested public so users are able to manage their own data and representation. Christina Harlow points to DocNow as a model for library and information professionals in opening our work of selecting, curating, and managing data and tools to the very users who are best positioned to shape and improve these practices.\n\n\n\nCollecting in collaboration with communities is slower, more complicated, yet this practice can support our reflection on biases inherent within traditional collecting policies, particularly who decides what is valuable, worth of collecting and preserving and therefore status, funding, and place within the archive. It also means we must address what collaboration looks like and mean within the library, particularly attention to what power structures are inherent and tacit within collaborations? Ed Summers, co-PI of Doc Now, indicates that collaboration can be a source of tension-but this tension is vital because the project has a responsibility to work with communities to insure people are authentically represented, or not, within the archive.\n\n\n\nIn the second example, for the <a href=\"http://dhtraining.org/hilt/course/depostcolonial-digital-humanities/\">De/Post/Colonial Digital Humanities</a> course at HILT 2015, Roopika Risam and Micha Cardenas collaborated with participants to develop a resource for designing digital humanities research with demonstrated commitments to social justice. 11 participants shared their work publically with an explicit invitation for others to contribute prompts and resources around access, material conditions, methods, ontologies and epistemologies that shape digital humanities. In their words, “The goal here is to make visible the critical and theoretical processes that subtend digital humanities practices.”\n\n\n\nThe site contains prompts, such as “How accessible is the project for people with disabilities?”  “How accessible is the project in low-bandwidth environments?” “Which archives does the project use?” and “Whose voices are absent from these archives?” alongside links to practitioners and resources engaged with the issues around a particular prompt.\n\n\n\nUsers are able to comment at sentence, paragraph, or section level, extending a conversation about practice beyond the local and temporally located working group. The goal here is not to stagnate or stall a project, rather to slow down and reflect upon the ethical choices needed in the creation of digital work. The goal is to break these choices down to manageable, addressable parts. As Amy Wickner observed, Ethical tensions are addressable.  While ethical considerations need to be at the center of our work, they need not prohibit this work from progressing.\n\n\n\nI return to Moya Bailey’s article, #transform(ing)DH Writing and Research, An Autoethnography of Digital Humanities and Feminist Ethics, quote “If my work and aims are not in collaboration with the communities I wish to talk with, then I’m not doing the right work. Transparency is essential for creating the kind of research that is of most use to these communities—the communities that are so graciously letting me and other scholars into their lives.”\n\n\n\nWith community collaborations, can we create and describe collections that show, offer modes of manipulation, and resist a single explanation or narrative? It is incredibly important to make visible the decisions that are made, from selection to description to discovery. These decisions are interpretive and can reinscribe erasure and exclusion, particularly when materials are gathered from those whose own cultural documentational methods are not considered valid or valuable to the institution.\n\n\n\nAn example of documentation as an element of transparency and collaboration is <a href=\"http://projectblacklight.org/\">Project BlackLight</a>, an open source, front-end, discovery interface for Apache Solr. Blacklight is now a part of Project Hydra, a collaboration to help institutions around the world preserve, maintain and give access to their knowledge repositories and assets.\n\n\n\nThe quickstart guide gives clear indication of the dependencies, which is great but the more exciting documentation is the Wiki. It is written in an welcoming tone with clear expectations of skillsets. Yet, if someone is interested but not experienced with Ruby there are links to resources and guides. The intention is not to reduce documentation to meet all skill-levels, but to point people towards clear avenues to best use Blacklight.\n\n\n\nReturning to Bardzell, who asks us to attend to the broadest context of stakeholders. Within the context of information platforms and systems, could we be transparent to our communities about who is building software and in what environment, what skills are expected to best utilize these platforms and systems, and where one could acquire such skills.\n\n\n\nSharing documentation and access to these platforms offer doorways for users to see the most recent version, empowers people to pull the code, change it, contribute back. Can we imagine documentation that is welcoming, simple to read, that communicates how the system or platform works? Why it was decided upon? Who contributed to it? And how users may fork it, change it, contribute back to it? As well as indicate to users the labor involved in creating the system and subsequent documentation?\n\n\n\nReturning to questions posed at the beginning, how do we grapple with the uncomfortable questions of who decides what is significant to carry forward, in whose memory is the past best preserved, how do we determine who counts as  ‘we’ and by which ethical frameworks guide our efforts of preservation and future-shaping?\n\n\n\nThe following three examples point to archival possibilities in the Anthropocene, two point to alternative modes of archival practice, while the third gestures to notions of non-human ‘archival’ practices. I am particularly influenced by Jessica Marie Johnson’s digital maroon communities. It’s a big quote, but I think her comments are particularly useful in the following examples:\n\n\n\nThe digital—doing digital work—has created and facilitated insurgent and maroon knowledge creation within the ivory tower. It’s imperfect and it’s problematic—and we are all imperfect and problematic. But in that sense I think the digital humanities, or doing digital work period, has helped people create maroon—free, black, liberatory, radical—spaces in the academy. I feel like there is a tension between thinking about digital humanities as an academic construct and thinking about what people do with these tools and digital ways of thinking. DH has offered people the means and opportunity to create new communities. And this type of community building should not be overlooked; it has literally saved lives as far as I’m concerned. People—those who have felt alone or maligned or those who have been marginalized or discriminated against or bullied—have used digital tools to survive and live. That’s not academic. If there isn’t a place for this type of work within what we are talking about as digital humanities, then I think we are having a faulty conversation.\n\n\n\nMany of the challenges and opportunities Johnson raises for the digital humanities are paralleled in archival work in a moment intensely unevenly distributed violences and protection or sanctuaries. Marisa Parham’s use of Toni Morrison’s re-memory useful here as well; memory and memory work as not totalizing but always contextualized in time and space.\n\n\n\nThis description of the <a href=\"http://communityfutureslab.tumblr.com/\">Community Futures Lab</a> comes from their facebook page:\n\n<blockquote>“Community Futurisms: Time &amp; Memory in North Philly” is a social practice, collaborative art, and ethnographic research project exploring oral histories, memories, alternative temporalities, and futures within the North Philadelphia neighborhood known as Sharswood/Blumberg. The area is currently undergoing a major redevelopment project after years of deep poverty, educational inequality, and high crime. “Community Futurisms” will document the redevelopment of Sharswood/Blumberg, through an multidisciplinary community art project that explores the intersections of futurism, literature, visual remixing, sound, and activism as art.</blockquote>\n\nCommunity Futures Lab is a gallery, library, workshop space, time capsule, recording booth, and community center. The goal of the Community Futures Lab is to collect, preserve, and share the Sharswood-Blumberg community’s memories and stories for future generations.\n\n\n\nIn spirit with Jarrett Drake’s Abolitionist Archive, meaning community and grassroots archives which work to eradicate structures of violence as they work to imagine and implement more just structures that support equality for all people,  the Community Futures Lab  is working to resist displacement, and explain or contextualize the pasts, but also signal towards and shape futures.\n\n\n\nProminent principles include:\n\n<ul>\n\n \t<li>Poly-vocalism—resists single gentrifying narrative, both of the completeness of such gentrification and the myriad sufferings and joys of neighborhood members; the oral history project in particular works as intervention to a single narrative, but workshops like DIY time-travel returns modes of recording stories to the individuals who make up the community</li>\n\n \t<li>Stewardship—while not scoping timelines for the care and maintenance of oral histories and other fruits of the CFL, there is significant attention to the care and stewardship of the community members and their stories, stewardship of the memories of the neighborhood and the processes of gentrification</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nAs archive in the Anthropocene, Community Futures Lab reminds us to not forget Haraway’s critique of the term—Anthropocene can be too big and too universalizing to capture the local pressures exerted by capitalism; it resists what David Edward’s has named dead priorities, money, capital and profit, as it asserts living priorities—people, animals, the planet at a neighborhood-scale. Community Futures Lab is actively working to advocate real structural change (re: housing assistance and education about tenant rights) as it imagines and strives for new modes of being in the current reality of gentrification and displacement.\n\n\n\nFuture Library Project is an art, forestry, and literary project led by Katie Paterson. A tract of forest is being planted near Oslo, Norway with the intention that in 100 years, a manuscript—until then unread—will be printed using trees from the forest. Each year, a small committee of 6 select and invite an author to contribute a manuscript to be held in trust for 100 years.\n\n\n\nPrinciples and elements\n\n<ul>\n\n \t<li>Significant effort engaged in stewardship within a named timeframe, like the Community Futures Lab there is attention to both care of materials and skills; in this case, the project includes a printing press and periodic training on how to use it.</li>\n\n \t<li>Transparency, clear who is selecting authors, attention to rotating board members every 10 years as to avoid narrowly (rather more narrowly since it is one author per year) speak the current moment to future audiences;</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nThe temporality of the project is compelling in that unlike the Community Futures Lab, the Future Library anticipates a near-future, but one just outside our experience.\n\n\n\nThe final possibility for considering archive in the Anthropocene are what Susan Weisner and others have termed accidental archives.\n\n\n\nArchives of trash or ocean plastics, archives that have no formal process of selection materials, rather our contributions act as an accession strategy gone wrong. Yet, scientists, environmentalists, and others use these vast collections to anticipate future challenges, such as the effects of plastics on filter feeders.\n\n\n\nAccidental archives are in conversation with notions of post-custodial archives—the idea that archivists will no longer physically acquire and maintain records, but that they will collaborate with communities to assist with the management of records which remain in the custody of the individuals or communities of origin. For “archive” of ocean plastics and trash, there is not a single community of origin, rather it is a shared responsibility—though, of course of unevenly distributed contributors and those who bear the costs. Accidental archives of ocean plastics highlight the primary challenge of the Anthropocene, where the protection and preservation of some ecologies and communities come at the cost to other ecologies and communities.\n\n\n\nThe lens of the Anthropocene gives us a way to look at large-scale threats and pressures and to contextualize local responses, to move between the two views attending particularly to practices of making, keeping, and utilizing of records for memory. It gives us a way to consider what our abilities to respond currently are and ways to imagine what our responses could be.\n\n\n\nAs an archivist, I am concerned about how these incredible and powerful archives will be carried forward so they may continue to speak futures into being. The collaboration between liberatory, or as Drake suggests, Abolitionist, archives and critical archivists, such as Caswell, Sangwand, and Punzalan help us connect  Jessica Marie Johnson’s maroon communities of DH, in the anticipation that these archives and archival projects help us better imagine and construct more just infrastructures that resist violence, silencing, and erasure, that protect the materials from which we may speak into being many possible pasts and many possible futures.

    ],
    "wp post content": "The <a title=\"Foreign Literatures in America\" href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/research/fla/\">Foreign Literatures in America</a> (FLA) project’s intellectual goals present a graphic design challenge marked by a delicate balance. We’re creating an archive that will demonstrate how the idea of Americanness has been shaped by actors beyond those traditionally labelled “American”; how do we create a logo and other graphic properties that reflect this focus on Americanness, without also presenting symbols of the United States (the U.S. flag, the shape of our portion of the continent, etc.) as visually—and thus thematically—dominant?\n\n\n\nWe found design inspiration in images such as Edward Brewer’s dark, estranging presentation of the Statue of Liberty on the front of a 1908 <em>Life</em> magazine, book covers like <a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2x4HHwXetWY/TZ5uW5FZ-jI/AAAAAAAAEMo/WPHAmpazAC4/s1600/Mar11j.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Kafka’s <em>Amerika</em></a>, and the iconic photographs of <a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ChjzKzpdNUo/SKSqmYSOrxI/AAAAAAAAAJA/vmWGjo6KsN0/s400/marilynreadingulysses.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Marilyn Monroe reading <em>Ulysses</em></a>. We researched estranged geographies: maps estranging the usual world placing of the United States by moving it from its usual central position or erasing it, showing the U.S. inscribed by bits of foreign textuality (e.g. by a grid of foreign flags or book covers). We thought about the Statue of Liberty in terms of its global history (images of the Statue being built in France or on the boat to the United States) and possible estrangement (perspectives aimed from behind the Statue and away from the U.S., or dividing the wrought-metal grid of the original “flame” into cells filled by flags of foreign nations). We even imagined a counterpart to Robert Buss’s \"<a href=\"http://charlesdickenspage.com/images/dickens_dream_600.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">Dickens Dreaming</a>\" painting, with Uncle Sam or the Statue of Liberty dreaming of key figures from foreign literature (way too complex for a logo!).\n\n\n\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-12857 alignnone\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/fla_landingimage.jpg\" alt=\"FLA\" width=\"610\" height=\"160\" />\n\n\n\nThroughout our discussions of imagery representing our project, we struggled with ways to indicate focus without dominance, influence without appropriation. Imagery like the melting pot or Manifest-Destiny-era political cartoons, although demonstrating both planetarity and an American focus, was shot down because it carried obvious implications of an imperialist America dominating or improving the literatures of other countries. The current FLA image uses a global map with an only partially imagined America, but we’ll probably transition to using images of circulation or communication (to use Peter’s phrase, “capillary exchange”) for our final logo; imagery involving bloodlines, trade routes, or circulation all speak to global routes passing through American culture. The difficulty with such images is to imply circular movement rather than an omnidirectional power emanating from or draining into the United States; a logo with the effect of a two-headed arrow would help us show a pluralized and opened United States, while at the same time demonstrating the cultural influences flowing in.\n\n\n\nA logo is admittedly a small thing, and only one item in a network of web design decisions that will frame how visitors interpret our project. At the same time, it’s the single most visible representative of the goals of our project; we’d be remiss if we didn’t port our close reading skills into our digital humanities design work.

It also has a blossoming industry that includes “text analytics” widely used in national security studies.\n\n\n\nThat type of DH research usually means digitizing massive amounts of texts, constructing databases, organizing information, and representing the patterns into meaningful conclusions. The researchers mine data in texts to make existing texts more accessible, and to discover connections and patterns difficult to decipher without computing power and information design.In the midst of building a databases for two digital humanities project, Dr. Craig Saper realized that the interfaces his team had constructed online had a more profound impact on how one read the texts than the use of the database alone.\n\n\n\nThe online interface changed how one read -- even changed the essence of what one read. The futures of reading using new devices, like e-readers, will have consequences for the definition and practice of what we call reading.\n\n\n\nSaper’s presentation for MITH’s Digital Dialogues will look at four of his major digital humanities projects – two online and two just starting – on read/i/n/g/  as a publishing practice and potential strategic alliances among the campuses on the university of Maryland system.\n\n\n\nThis talk will be held in the MITH Conference Room, in the basement of McKeldin Library.\n\n\n\nCraig Saper (csaper&lt;at&gt;umbc&lt;dot&gt;edu) is on the faculty of the Language, Literacy, &amp; Culture multi-disciplinary doctoral program at UMBC, and has published widely, and in multimodal formats, on the digital humanities.  He is the author of <em>Intimate Bureaucracies</em> (2012), <em>Networked Art</em> (2001) and <em>Artificial Mythologies </em>(1997). He has edited, and written afterwards for, Bob Brown's <em>Words</em> and <em>The Readies</em> (both 2009), and he edited, with C. J. Freeman and W. Garrett-Petts, an anthology on <em>Imaging Place</em> (2009). He has guest edited special issues of <em>Visible Language</em> (1988) and <em>Style</em> (2001), and co-edited, with Ellen Berry, a special issue of <em>Rhizomes</em> on “Drifts” (2007), and, with R. Burt, on “posthumography” (2010). He is also the reviews editor and \"Blog Report\" columnist for <em>Rhizomes</em>. He wrote the introduction to Sharon Kivland's <em>A Disturbance of Memory</em>, II (2008). His curatorial projects include exhibits on \"Assemblings\" (1997), \"Noigandres: Concrete Poetry in Brazil\" (1988), \"TypeBound\" (2008), and <a href=\"http://www.folkvine.org\" target=\"_blank\">folkvine.org</a> (2003-6). He is presently completing a biography of a poet-publisher-inventor-impresario-writer in every imaginable genre, Bob Brown, who invented a reading machine.

    "wp post content": "Digital Humanists from across the globe gathered last week at our annual conference, <a href=\"http://www.dh2012.uni-hamburg.de/\" target=\"_blank\">DH2012</a>, hosted in the lovely city of Hamburg, Germany. While the weather felt tremendously cold to those of us who've spent the last few weeks in the US with 100 plus degree temps, the conference itself could not have had a warmer reception. From keynotes that explored the intersections of cultural studies, internationality, and digitality to the variety of conference presentations and events, DH2012 lived up to its efforts to capture digital culture and the current state of the field. And Hamburg itself was welcoming to a large number of us who spoke no German beyond simple phrases.\n\nContinuing our efforts to capture trends, innovative research agendas, and just plain DH fun for those who can't always attend every event they want, here are a few quick thoughts on the conference.\n\nFrom an U.S. centered-perspective, the week was a celebration of the funding efforts of the <a href=\"http://www.neh.gov/divisions/odh\" target=\"_blank\">Office of Digital Humanities</a> and the tremendous work they have done to increase the disciplinary, methodological, and humanistic questions being funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities. From the work of the Alliance for Networking Visual Culture's <a href=\"http://scalar.usc.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Scalar</a> (still in beta) to Scholar's Labs recently released <a href=\"http://neatline.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Neatline</a> through our own <a title=\"Topic Modeling Workshop\" href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/topicmodeling\" target=\"_blank\">Topic Modeling Workshop</a>, the ODH proved that even small amount of federal funding can have transformative powers in Humanities research. I only wish that NEH administrators and our Congress could have been in the room for these presentations: the question of the value of the NEH and the impact of ODH more specifically was soundly recognized by the international audience and proved that there is a value in humanities within the globally-engaged world.\n\nMore internationally-speaking, the conference was a continuing salvo in the rapid spread of digital humanities, both to individuals but also to entirely new professional and institutional organizations. The Japanese Digital Humanities Organization joined the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations, our national umbrella organization (with our own Neil Fraistat as its incoming Chair of the Steering Committee), while the Germans celebrated the solidification of their own national organization.\n\nFor all of these trumpets and well-deserved fanfare, DH2012 continued its existing efforts to grapple with diversity. While the gender balance visually appears to be improving, the event itself continues to struggle with garnering the attention and attendance of digital humanists in Latin America, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Africa (to name just a few). The Mexican Network of Digital Humanists (<a href=\"http://humanidadesdigitales.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Red de Humanistas Digitales, RedHD</a>) held the <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20120729020753/http://humanidadesdigitales.net:80/index.php/component/content/article/7-noticias/91-encuentro-de-humanistas-digitales\" target=\"_blank\">First Meeting (or Conference) of Digital Humanists</a> at the <a href=\"http://www.bibliotecavasconcelos.gob.mx/\" target=\"_blank\">Vasconcelos Library</a>, Mexico City earlier this year and presented a bit on their efforts but, by and large, the conference was dominated by attendees from the U.S., Canada, and Western Europe. There are digital humanities efforts in other nations. How can we do better to support their attendance at our international event?\n\nRelated to, but divergent from, the issue of national diversity is the issue of diversity in Digital Humanities more generally. Brought to attention in a number of presentations but especially that of Amy Earhart (see the <a href=\"http://lecture2go.uni-hamburg.de/konferenzen/-/k/13976\" target=\"_blank\">video</a>), I was troubled by the definition of what constituted/constitutes diversity and where those methodologies, pedagogies, and theories seemed to have disappeared to. With clear exception of Earhart and a handful of others, it seemed diversity beyond nationality was a gesture in name only (read: I've included women within my data, or women are part of the project, or this project concerns nationality X). There was extraordinarily little attention to diversity as construction, where race, class, ability, sexuality, and on modify, constrain, construct, and influence the data, methodology, pedagogy, theory, and research practices within digital humanities. I am reminded of a friend who, in a discussion of metholodogical developments in my own dissertation work on early 20th century white middle-class male production of Native American masculinity through halftime mascotry/performance, once remarked to me about a thesis I'd written: \"all of the work you've done is great, but you've missed the obvious point: until you address the white, the middle-class, the male, the production, the masculinity, the identity politics, AND the performance aspects that exclude others from those categories and sources/data, you haven't done a responsible analysis.\" Put more simply, a responsible humanistic analysis recognizes divergent data, theory, methodology, pedagogy and practice. As a historian, I'm not permitted to gesture at subaltern theorists, outlying sources, or isolationist research practice just because I am focused on achieving a methodological goal. I must instead confront, rectify, and engage with these things or else leave myself open to critique. Just because we discuss the technical methodologies more blantently and frequently within our gathering and focus on our products, does not mean we should discard our obligations as humanists: to produce sound scholarly inquiries that answer humanities questions.\n\nI don't mean to suggest that there are not shining examples of projects, individuals, and institutions that are confronting these issues...but until exchange between digital humanists addresses not just the digital methodological questions but also the humanistic methodological questions, I fear we will continue to suffer from stymied efforts to address diversity in meaningful ways. I find myself wanting to shout: Where my Cultural Theorists At?\n\nI lay no blame for this on the program committee, nor the professional organization as a whole, but instead suggest that it is our obligation as individual scholars to recruit the attendance and presentation of promising scholars from fields that offer potential to transform digital humanities. In my conference-addled brain, I hope for a digital humanities future where we see the emergence of scholars who can easily merge method, theory, and practice in meaningful ways that truly interrogate our assumptions, dependencies, and conclusions.",

In fact, CollateX has several alignment methods built into libraries that can be utilized. This is outside of what I feel comfortable talking about (I don’t really read Java … yet) but there is no reason we can’t allow users to select methods and see what yields the best results.</li>\n\t<li>Don’t build unnecessary mechanisms (Desmond Schmidt). Well taken. As a non-programmer, I’m not always the best judge of what is difficult or simple to build. The point though was to allow manual error-correction of the alignment by adding or deleting cells in a table row. As for the order of witnesses, my own sense is that it is extremely useful for visually examining groupings of manuscripts.</li>\n\t<li>Apparatus unnecessary (Desmond Schmidt), or unwieldy (Daniel Stoekl, Naftali Cohn). Well, Stoekl, a potential user, suggests that the print-type apparatus is useful. It is a way of compactly summarizing data. My include-everything model is in fact unwieldy, and the suggestion to leave out readings that are identical with the base text would simplify the situation. Just how text families can be generated and then used in the apparatus is a discussion for a later day, but it is definitely a desideratum.</li>\n\t<li>Additional textual detail; handling absence of evidence (Daniel Stoekl, Naftali Cohn). These are important points. For collation, I made the decision to present a simplified text, but obviously this will have to be made more complex. I don’t think additional tagging is necessary in most cases; different processing is. For additions, corrections in second hand, we effectively generate an additional witness, but ignore the readings of that secondary witness except when they differ from the primary witness. For dealing with highly lacunose texts, the method will be: to have a reference text that includes individual addressing for each word in the Mishnah. The tagging in the lacunose text aligns the text and lacunae with the reference text. At a minimum, this allows us to identify “gaps” to be ignored and “gaps” to be processed. A reference text of the Bavot exists, and I am working on extending it further, but we are still working on the pointing mechanism.</li>\n\t<li>Search functionality (Naftali Cohn). Yes, but what? Ironically, I can envision complex searches (a particular abbreviation in texts in Sephardic hands) more easily than simple searches. What should a search for “Rabbi Meir” or “Prohibited” return?</li>\n\t<li>Other matters (Naftali Cohn). My December and January task is to start working on page by page and chapter by chapter view, especially that now my text sample includes extended runs of text. I’d also like to be able to generate apparatus or alignments for a whole chapter.</li>\n</ol>\n<em>Hayim Lapin is Robert H.

    "wp post content": "After a long but pleasant flight, a shorter but even more pleasant train ride, and a scenic bus ride from the train station, I am finally at the University of Wuerzburg at the Interedition conference. It's exciting to be here with so many other professionals from annotation and linking projects.\n\nInteredition was originally set up to get domain experts for text analysis tools together and ask them how to make their tools interoperable. A by-product of this action was a creation of a Java suite called CollateX. However, this is not the only reason for the conference. It is founded on the desire to create common goals and networks between DH programmers.\n\nThis Bootcamp will last from Friday, October 7th to Tuesday, October 11th. It has a lot of the same people who were present from the last Bootcamp in March, which I attended, plus some new faces. To see what happened in the previous Bootcamps, check out the Interedition wiki: <a href=\"http://www.interedition.eu/wiki/index.php/Main_Page\">http://www.interedition.eu/wiki/index.php/Main_Page</a>\n\n<a title=\"Joris Van Zundert\" href=\"http://alfalablog.huygensinstituut.nl/?page_id=122\">Joris Van Zundert</a>, the head organizer for Interedition, had the same train as me, so we were able to have a great discussion on the train about the Interedition conference. Joris feels that so long as we come out of the conference with a clear understanding on how to make the various tools collaborators bring interoperable, the weekend will be successful. We'll see if that goal is met or exceeded.\n\nWhat this Bootcamp has done well so far is provide a lot of examples of interesting projects that involve markup and text. The following is a list of the presentations, where I've tried my best to write down what each person is doing and their University/research affiliation. Honestly, there is so much here that I'm just trying to keep up!\n\n<strong>University of Madrid</strong> - A project is focusing on developing an open collaborative annotator for Google Books. The developers have ambitions to utilize the Hathi Trust into their reader. This opened up a discussion on how to gain access to these large libraries, e.g. working around the Hathi API, dealing with Google Books licenses, etc.\n\n<strong>Gregor Middell (middell.net) - Faust Edition project</strong>: creation of a large metadata and self-transcription tool library. This tool uses the CKEditor to create linkages between authority files in their Library's database and marked up transcriptions of documents.\n\n<strong>Typewrite: Nineteenth-century Scholarship Online</strong> - taking low-quality OCR scans and improving their quality. This is done through an interface that automatically outlines OCR regions gleaned from their TEI-A documents that describe the OCR and displays the output text from the OCR. Users can then edit the output text to correct machine errors, thus making a good crowd-sourcing application for transcription and OCR. Those who complete correcting a transcription receive as their reward a copy of that transcription from the repository. Having users contribute corrections also allows for a live feedback of common errors and bugs from the OCR process.\n\n<strong>TextLab: Melville Electronic Library</strong> - a tool that produces XML markup that displays sequences of editorial decisions within a manuscript. This is done through a user interface that displays the image of the manuscript\n\n<strong>Elaborate - Hyugens Institute - http://www.e-laborate.nl/en/</strong> which is similar to the TILE project I worked on, where annotations are made on text transcriptions. Users have the option to attach metadata and annotations to the text they transcribe. They then publish the data to a XML database, which is then exported to other formats.\n\n<strong>CATMA: University of Hamburg http://www.catma.de </strong>- a large desktop-based application written in Java that allows for easy markup of text using color-coded highlighters. This creates an overlapping hierarchy of annotations within a text. These annotations are stored in memory and can then later be queried against and used in word searches of the marked-up text. This allows for some beautiful graphs and charts of statistical analysis within any text. What's coolest to me about this tool is that it allows for overlapping of annotations within a text and yet keeps the output XML (mostly) TEI-compliant.\n\n<strong>University of Muenster</strong> - building tools to help scholars look through a large paper-based database of witnesses of the New Testament of the Bible. This includes incorporating demographic metadata into text and images. They also set as their goals transcription and indexing of the text. They are currently prototyping using OpenSocial applications to publish images and annotations through pubsub. Honestly, this looks to be the most promising\n\n<a href=\"http://digital-editor.blogspot.com/2010/10/jon.html\"><strong>University of Saint Louis, TPEN project</strong></a> - Developed an interface for paleographical documents that supports collaborative tagging and transcribing of manuscript images. This also shares a lot of the same philosophy in exporting XML and technical features as <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/tile/\" target=\"_blank\">TILE</a>.\n\nWhat has emerged thus far as a common definition of interoperability is the ability to visually set up tools next to one another. It also means creating chains of tools that take over the simple, individual tasks associated with OCR, text mining, transcription, and annotation and make them more accessible and standardized. Whatever I said during my presentation has created a spark and there will definitely be a workshop/group focused on the OAC specs and common pathways forward with using that model for interoperability.\n\nI think that's enough for one blog post  - stay tuned for updates and, eventually, pictures...\n\nGrant",

SNYDER\n\n\n\nIs there a place for virtual reality in the digital humanities toolkit? For all of the early hype surrounding the use virtual reality for teaching and learning and the ubiquity of online options for exploring three-dimensional worlds, the challenges inherent in developing and sustaining large-scale academic reconstruction projects limit their viability and likelihood for success.\n\n\n\nAcademics considering such foolishness must contend with disciplinary skepticism, the need to articulate appropriate research questions to justify the effort required to produce tangible results, and pressure to develop methodologies for annotations and citations that are comparable to print publications. From a project management perspective, three-dimensional research is difficult because it requires a specific start-up environment, ongoing funding beyond that typically available to the humanities researcher, and a clearly defined ultimate use for the eventual product that justifies the expended effort. From a curricular perspective, virtual reality research exists only on the borders of digital humanities as it is currently defined. In order to fully integrate three-dimensional research into the curriculum, administrators need to contend with issues of scalability, the availability of software, a need for clearly defined learning objectives, and a steep learning curve that can negatively impact student projects.\n\n\n\nWorking from the conviction that virtual reality – even given these daunting challenges – does provide significant research opportunities for academics and benefits to student users, this presentation will focus on the reconstruction projects that are the hallmark of three-dimensional research at UCLA. Following a demonstration of the World’s Columbian Exposition project currently under construction, Snyder will discuss her project team’s efforts to leverage existing and new computer modeling work for pedagogical use through a new NEH-funded real-time software interface and content repository intended to provide a mechanism for exploring highly detailed three-dimensional models in educational settings.\n\n\n\nThis talk will be held at the School of Architecture (Building 145), Room 1111. The event will begin at 2:00 p.m., followed by a reception in the Dean's Conference Room.\n\n\n\n<strong>Dr. Lisa M. Snyder</strong> is a senior member of the Urban Simulation Team at UCLA, an associate director of the Experiential Technologies Center, and on staff with the Institute for Digital Research and Education, a division of UCLA’s Office of Information Technology. Her research is focused on the educational use of large-scale interactive computer reconstructions of historic urban environments.\n\n\n\nSnyder is currently working on a real-time reconstruction of the World’s Columbian Exposition held in Chicago in 1893. This work is regularly showcased at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago and appears in the documentary <em>Make No Little Plans: Daniel Burnham and the American City</em>. She is also a principal investigator on an NEH-funded project team that is developing a new interface to facilitate classroom use of interactive computer reconstructions. This run time software was designed to accommodate a range of student-centered activities and teacher-centered presentations within a framework that provides secondary scholars access to the historical evidence, methodologies, and interpretive choices that informed the creation of the virtual world.\n\n\n\nSnyder was the primary modeler on the interactive computer reconstructions of the Temple Mount site that were developed jointly by the Urban Simulation Team and the Israel Antiquities for the Davidson Center in the Jerusalem Archaeological Park. The Herodian version of the model was installed in 2001. The reconstruction was based on excavations conducted under the direction of archaeologist Ronny Reich and regional archaeologist Gideon Avni, and it shows visitors how excavators believe the Temple Mount appeared prior to its destruction by Roman troops in the year 70 C.E. In 2007, an expanded version of the simulation model was unveiled that includes a reconstruction of the early Islamic structures on and around the Temple Mount based on excavations at the site conducted under the direction of Jerusalem district archaeologist Yuval Baruch. Beyond the Davidson Center, this work has been featured in installations at the Gulf Coast Exploreum Science Center, the Royal Ontario Museum, the Science Museum of Minnesota, the Frankfurter Bibelgesellschaft, and the Oriental Institute Museum at the University of Chicago.\n\n\n\nA continuously updated schedule of talks is also available on the Digital Dialogues webpage.\n\n\n\nUnable to attend the events in person?\n\n\n\nArchived podcasts can be found on the MITH website, and you can follow our Digital Dialogues Twitter account <a title=\"Digital Dialogues on Twitter\" href=\"http://twitter.com/digdialog\" target=\"_blank\">@digdialog</a> as well as the Twitter hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=mithdd\" target=\"_blank\">#mithdd</a> to keep up with live tweets from our sessions.\n\n\n\nAll talks free and open to the public.

Anyone with an interest in the book is welcome to attend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>Pattern Recognition</em> has been widely received as Gibson's most significant and prescient work since he coined the term \"cyberspace\" in 1984. \"We have no future because the present is too volatile,\" observes one character. \"We have only risk management. The spinning of a given moment's scenarios. Pattern recognition.\" But how do we tell the difference between pattern and coincidence? Is pattern recognition enabling or constraining? What kind of patterns emerge in a novel about digital art, Web memes, global capital, viral marketing, a postmodern advertising agency, cool hunters, and collectors of antiquarian computing equipment in settings from London to Tokyo to Moscow to post-9/11 New York? Our discussion will be the basis for three additional Digital Dialogues, to be held at intervals throughout the semester, each of which will explore the general theme of \"pattern recognition\"--a heuristic for much of MITH's current research--in varied contexts. We look forward to seeing you at any or all of these.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to the pattern recognition sessions, we have speakers and events planned for Digital Dialogues for just about every Tuesday in the spring semester--always at 12:30. Plan to make Digital Dialogues a part of your intellectual week and watch for the full schedule very soon.",

Since I am an historian, I approach these questions by asking where we have been and how we got here. Digital Humanities 1.0 was the use of information technology and computing to produce forms of scholarship that literally could not be done in the analog age: the encoding of text (TEI), computational linguistics and the creation of humanities databases (Perseus) were the two most prominent examples. DH 2.0 was the era inaugurated by IATH and scholars such as Jerry McGann, Ed Ayers and others in reconceptualizing traditional humanities questions through the intellectual power of technology -- relating text to image, creating complexly interrelated databases, use of large-scale digitization. DH 3.0 is where I hope we are, searching for a new order of technical possibilities that will change modes of thought. DH 3.0 assumes the technology and moves on to give primary consideration to intellectual problems that were inconceivable in either the analog or early digital eras. The challenge is no longer either the usage of technology or the linking of technology to more or less traditional humanities problems, but reconceptualizing the problems. But of course all of this assumes what is not true -- that we put a digital humanities infrastructure into place.\r\r\n\r\r\nSTANLEY KATZ, Lecturer with the rank of Professor in the Woodrow Wilson School of Princeton University, is President Emeritus of the American Council of Learned Societies. He graduated from Harvard University in 1955 with a major in English History and Literature, and his Ph.D. in the same field from Harvard in 1961. He attended Harvard Law School in 1969-70. His recent research focuses upon the relationship of civil society and constitutionalism to democracy, and upon the relationship of the United States to the international human rights regime. Formerly Class of 1921 Bicentennial Professor of the History of American Law and Liberty at Princeton University, Katz is a scholar of American legal and constitutional history, and on philanthropy and non-profit institutions. He is the Editor of the Oliver Wendell Holmes Devise History of the Supreme Court of the United States and of the forthcoming Oxford International Encyclopedia of Legal History (6 vols., February, 2009). The author and editor of numerous books and articles, he has served as President of the Organization of American Historians and the American Society for Legal History and as Vice President of the Research Division of the American Historical Association. He is a member of the Board of Trustees of the Newberry Library, the Copyright Clearance Center and numerous other institutions. He is currently Vice President of the International Society for Cultural Property and a Commissioner of the National Historic Publications and Records Commission. He also currently serves as Chair of the American Council of Learned Societies/Social Science Research Council Working Group on Cuba. Katz is a member of the New Jersey Council for the Humanities, the American Antiquarian Society, the American Philosophical Society; a Fellow of the American Society for Legal History, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the Society of American Historians; a Corresponding Member of the Massachusetts Historical Society and an Academico Correspondiente of the Cuban Academy of Sciences.

As yet, we know little about the operation of copyright in the digital environment, and archives and other cultural heritage institutions are seeking to develop best practices that will make their holdings more widely available while protecting the legitimate interests of rights holders. Jean Dryden will discuss the findings of her doctoral dissertation, which found that Canadian repositories&apos; copyright practices in making their holding available online are more restrictive than copyright law envisages, both in terms of what they select for Internet access, and their attempts to control further uses of their online holdings.\n\n\n\nIn 2008, JEAN DRYDEN joined the faculty of Maryland&apos;s i-School, where she teaches in the archives, records, and information management program. Her dissertation explored the copyright practices of Canadian archival repositories in digitizing their holdings for Internet access.  Her research interests include copyright in the digital environment, information law and policy, archival arrangement and description, and digital preservation, as these issues pertain to access to information.\n\n\n\nComing up @MITH 2/24: William Noel (Walters Art Museum), \"Archimedes in Bits: Ten Years of Work on the Archimedes Palimpsest\"\n\n\n\nView MITH's complete Digital Dialogues schedule here:\n\n\n\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20100615144914/http://www.mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_spring_2009.pdf\n\n\n\nAll talks free and open to the public!\n\n\n\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-8927).",

In addition, recipients will receive $1,000 for travel to conferences where work from the dissertation can be presented.\r\n\r\nNominees will be evaluated on three main criteria:\r\n\r\n1. The potential contribution of the dissertation to the Digital Humanities.\r\n\r\n2. The quality of the student's work.\r\n\r\n3. The likelihood of the student successfully completing the dissertation.\r\n\r\nApplicants will be asked to submit an application form; a 500-1000 word abstract written for a general audience; a statement of work completed to date, work remaining, and expected completion date; a curriculum vitae; and two letters of recommendation, one of which must be from the student's dissertation director.\r\n\r\nStudents who wish to apply for the fellowship should submit a copy of the application form and the required attachments to Neil Fraistat, Director of MITH, McKeldin Library B0131, Campus.\r\n\r\nStudents who have funding that is related to their dissertation research or another substantial fellowship should not apply.\r\n\r\n<strong>Applications for Spring 2007 are due at MITH by noon, Monday, December 4, 2006</strong>. The recipient will be announced in mid-December 2006.\r\n\r\nPlease address any questions to Neil Fraistat, Director of MITH.",

    "wp post content": "A MITH Digital Dialogue\n\nTuesday, March 24, 12:30-1:45\n\nMITH Conference Room, McKeldin Library B0135\n\n\n\n\"Are Robots Real? The Robot as an Object of Study\"\n\nby DESPINA KAKOUDAKI\n\n\n\nThis talk explores the figure of the robot as an object of study, and one that specifically requires an integration of methodologies from both the humanities and the sciences. Traditionally, the figure of the robot has been regarded very differently in these two realms: in the sciences, it is related to the promises of scientific inquiry, and motivates research and innovation in actual technological applications, or the future possibility for such applications. In the humanities, however, the robot is a figure of fiction and science fiction, which, despite its un-reality channels feelings about culture and technology, difference and justice, often in indirect ways. After exploring the implications and fundamental trends of the two modes, the paper proposes that an integrated interdisciplinary methodology would allow us to better understand the attraction and meaning of the robot as a figure, without resorting to the binary opposition between fantasy and reality. Using examples from fiction, popular culture, recent scientific applications and research in robotics, I argue that the two approaches fuel each other: as cultural figures, robots are both real and imaginary, and indeed it is often their imaginary qualities that fuel and inspire actual research.  Despite the claims of roboticists that real robots are immanent, the cultural power and meaning of robots comes from their fictional and literary tradition, indeed from their unreality, their virtuality.\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nDESPINA KAKOUDAKI teaches interdisciplinary courses in literature and film, visual culture, and the history of technology and new media at American University. She completed her doctorate in Comparative Literature at the University of California at Berkeley, and has taught at UC Berkeley and Harvard University, where she was instrumental in the formation of the film studies undergraduate and graduate programs. This talk is part of a larger two-book project on the representation of artificial people, such as robots, cyborgs and androids, in literature, film and philosophy. She has received a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Humanities for her current book project, The Human Machine: A Cultural History of Artificial People, which traces the history and cultural function of constructed people and animated objects from antiquity to the present.\n\n\n\nKakoudaki's interests include cultural studies, silent cinema, science fiction, apocalyptic narratives, and the representation of race and gender in literature and film. She has co-edited a new collection of essays on the work of Pedro AlmodÃ³var (with Brad Epps, forthcoming from the University of Minnesota Press), and published articles on robots and cyborgs, race and melodrama in action and disaster films, body transformation and technology in early film, the political role of the pin-up in World War II, and the representation of the archive in postmodern fiction.\n\n\n\nComing up @MITH 3/31: &quot;Shakespeare&apos;s Quartos: A MITH Research Update&quot;\n\n\n\nView MITH's complete Digital Dialogues schedule here:\n\n\n\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20100615144914/http://www.mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_spring_2009.pdf\n\n\n\nAll talks free and open to the public!\n\n\n\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-8927).",

Michael's dissertation, \"Constitutional Regime Leadership in a World of States,\" involves the use of digital technologies to analyze the public and private writings of Jefferson, Madison, and Hamilton to better establish how their core beliefs about the nature and the causes of war and peace influenced their views on constitutional design.\r\n\r\nWe at MITH very much look forward to working with Nadja and Michael on these two interesting projects and wish to thank Roberta Lavine (Spanish and Portuguese), Angel Nieves (ARCH/CRGE), and last year's Winnemore Dissertation Fellow, Michele Mason (Communication), for Joining us on this year's Winnemore Fellowship Committee.",

They must also support and mediate appropriate access:\nallowing users to make sense of materials and understand their\ncontext, while also preventing inadvertent disclosure of sensitive\ndata.\n\n\"There are already many cases of self-contained packages that bundle\nmany of the tools in order to support digital forensics activities,\"\nsaid <a href=\"http://www.ils.unc.edu/callee/\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Christopher (Cal) Lee</a>, principal investigator of the\nBitCurator project. \"However, they are not likely to be very\napproachable to library/archives professionals in terms of interface\nand documentation. Even more importantly, there are two fundamental\nneeds for collecting institutions that are not addressed by software\ndesigned for the digital forensics industry: incorporation into the\nworkflow of archives/library ingest and collection management\nenvironments, and provision of public access to the data.\"\n\nThe BitCurator project is an effort to build, test and analyze systems\nand software for incorporating digital forensics methods into the\nworkflows of a variety of collecting institutions. <a href=\"//mkirschenbaum.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Matthew\nKirschenbaum</a>, associate director of MITH is the co-principal\ninvestigator of the project. <a href=\"//sils.unc.edu/people/faculty/post-doc-faculty\" target=\"_blank\">Kam Woods</a>, postdoctoral research\nassociate at SILS, serves as the technical lead for the BitCurator\nproject. Two groups of external partners will contribute to this\nprocess: a professional expert panel of individuals who are at various\nlevels of implementing digital forensics tools and methods in their\ncollecting institution contexts, and a development advisory group of\nindividuals who have significant experience with development of\nsoftware.\n\nBitCurator will define and test support for a digital curation\nworkflow that begins at the point of encountering holdings that reside\non removable media-either new acquisitions or materials that are\nwithin a repositories existing holdings-and extends to the point of\ninteraction with an end user.  BitCurator will address both the client\nside tools required at the point of initial data extraction and\nback-end tools for batch processing of disk images, which are likely\nto reside on a remote server.\n\n\"This project speaks to several of the key findings from the earlier\nMellon-funded report on Digital Forensics and Cultural Heritage\nCollections,\" said Kirschenbaum. \"It's especially exciting to see an\niSchool and a digital humanities center collaborating on tools that\nwill benefit not only the archivists processing born-digital\nmaterials, but also the scholars who will be using them.\"\n\nFor more information about the project, please visit the BitCurator\nWeb site at: <a href=\"http://bitcurator.net/\" target=\"_blank\">bitcurator.net</a> and follow <a href=\"//twitter.com/bitcurator\" target=\"_blank\">@bitcurator</a> on Twitter.\n<span style=\"color: #888888\">\n</span>",

    "wp post content": "Call for Participation: Advanced TEI Seminar as MITH\n\nAn advanced seminar in TEI encoding for manuscripts will be offered at MITH January 20-22, 2010. The seminar is sponsored by the Brown University Women Writers Project with generous funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities. It will be led by Julia Flanders and Syd Bauman, the instructors for a very successful introductory seminar on TEI held at MITH in 2008.\n\nThis seminar assumes a basic familiarity with TEI and will be focused on the detailed challenges of encoding manuscript materials, including editorial, transcriptional, and interpretive issues and the methods of representing these in TEI markup.\n\nIntended for people who are already involved in a text encoding project or are in the process of planning one, the seminar will be focused on the detailed challenges of encoding manuscript materials, including editorial, transcriptional, and interpretive issues and the methods of representing these in TEI markup. It will include a mix of presentations, discussion, case studies using participants' projects, hands-on practice, and individual consultation. It will also be strongly project-based: participants will present their projects to the group, discuss specific challenges and encoding strategies, develop encoding specifications and documentation, and create encoded sample documents and templates.\n\nProject teams and collaborative groups are encouraged to apply, although individuals are also welcome. A basic knowledge of the TEI Guidelines and some prior experience with text encoding (e.g. an introductory workshop, job experience, etc.) will be assumed.\n\nTravel funding is available of up to $500 per participant.\n\nThe application deadline is August 10.\n\nFor information on how to apply, and for more detailed information on the seminar program, please visit <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through\">http://www.wwp.brown.edu/encoding/seminars</span>.",

    "wp post content": "Back in October, we introduced the MITH/UM Libraries Born Digital Working Group (BDWG) with a post about<a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/we-descended-processing-the-bill-bly-collection-with-the-umd-born-digital-working-group/\"> processing the Bill Bly Collection</a>.  Since then we’ve firmed up our goals (\"start collecting/working with diverse born digital materials in the libraries\"  being a bit nebulous and… huge) and divided ourselves into sub-groups to conquer them. Goals and groups decided upon, we're going to try to give bi-weekly updates on our work, cross-posted to the MITH and <a href=\"http://hornbakelibrary.wordpress.com/\">Special Collections</a> blogs. We'll be cycling through the groups to ensure every area is covered; those areas are: tools, policies/procedures, metadata, and administration.\n\n<strong>Tools</strong>\nOriginally called \"Technology/BitCurator/hardware/software/tools,\" this subgroup is dedicated to pre-processing work--everything that happens before an acquisition is deposited in the digital repository. The Tools group is led by Jennie Levine Knies and includes Amanda Visconti, Eric Cartier, Matt Kirschenbaum, Porter Olsen and Rachel Donahue.\n\n<strong>Policy/Procedures</strong>\nDedicated to developing the many guidelines necessary to implement new digital workflows in the libraries. The Policy/Procedures group is led by Joanne Archer and includes Caitlin Wells, Daniel Mack, Rachel Donahue, Robin Pike, and Trevor Muñoz.\n\n<strong>Metadata</strong>\nDedicated to data about data. Specifically, this group will look at everything that’s needed to create a properly-described submission information package (SIP). The Metadata Group is led by Joshua Westgard and includes Eric Cartier,Jennie Levine Knies, and Rachel Donahue.\n\n<strong>Administration</strong>\nDedicated to providing the high-level support needed by change agents everywhere. Administration was originally lumped in with Policy/Procedures, but we broke it out to keep things specific and manageable. The Administration group is led by Trevor Muñoz and includes Daniel Mack, Jennie Levine Kniees, Joanne Archer, Matthew Kirschenbaum, and Rachel Donahue.\n\nAs you read our posts in the future, bear in mind that we're essentially starting from scratch. We're unlikely to have anything amazingly groundbreaking to share, but we hope that being transparent about our work might help other organizations undergoing similar changes.",

Transparency is essential for creating the kind of research that is of most use to these communities—the communities that are so graciously letting me and other scholars into their lives.”</blockquote>\n\nWith community collaborations, can we create and describe collections that show, offer modes of manipulation, and resist a single explanation or narrative? It is incredibly important to make visible the decisions that are made, from selection to description to discovery. These decisions are interpretive and can reinscribe erasure and exclusion, particularly when materials are gathered from those whose own cultural documentational methods are not considered valid or valuable to the institution.\n\n\n\nOne example of documentation as an element of transparency and collaboration is <a href=\"https://github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight/\">Project BlackLight</a>, an open source, front-end, discovery interface for Apache Solr. Blacklight is now a part of <a href=\"http://projecthydra.org/\">Project Hydra</a>, a collaboration to help institutions around the world preserve, maintain and give access to their knowledge repositories and assets.\n\n\n\nThe quickstart guide gives clear indication of the dependencies, which is great but the more exciting documentation is the Wiki. It is written in an welcoming tone with clear expectations of skillsets. Yet, if someone is interested but not experienced with Ruby there are links to resources and guides. The intention is not to reduce documentation to meet all skill-levels, but to point people towards clear avenues to best use Blacklight.\n\n\n\nReturning to Bardzell, who asks us to attend to the broadest context of stakeholders. Within the context of library platforms and systems, <strong>could we be transparent to our communities about who is building software and in what environment, what skills are expected to best utilize these platforms and systems, and where one could acquire such skills.</strong>\n\n\n\nSharing documentation and access to library platforms offer doorways for users to see the most recent version, empowers people to pull the code, change it, contribute back. Can we imagine library documentation that is welcoming, simple to read, that communicates how the system or platform works? Why it was decided upon? <strong>Who contributed to it?</strong> And how users may fork it, change it, contribute back to it? As well as indicate to users the labor involved in creating the system and subsequent documentation?\n\n\n\nParticularly within the question of who contributes to the development of library software, but also extending to who makes up library committees, collaborates with students, performs outreach to campus and communities?-these questions are inherently questions of staffing, labor, and library policies.\n\n\n\nIt is time-consuming and difficult to be transparent in why and how our policies come about; it means taking down and reimagining our hiring and retention practices. As April Hathcock wrote in her 2015 article <a href=\"http://www.inthelibrarywiththeleadpipe.org/2015/lis-diversity/\">White Librarianship in Blackface: Diversity Initiatives in LIS</a>:\n\n<blockquote>“We need to make space for our diverse colleagues to thrive within the profession. In short, we need to dismantle whiteness from within LIS. We can best do that in two equally important ways: by modifying our diversity programs to attract truly diverse applicants and by mentoring early career librarians in both playing at and dismantling whiteness in LIS.”</blockquote>\n\nShe continues, “when we recruit for whiteness, we will get whiteness; but when we recruit for diversity, we will truly achieve diversity.” We can, with attention to our hiring and retention practices, make space for more black, brown, trans, and queer bodies to contribute to library software, library committees, and outreach efforts.\n\n\n\nThis making space is difficult—it takes time, money, effort to examine and dismantle existing practices and to imagine then build new, more equitable and just ones.\n\n\n\nMaking space, for me, means returning to the Carol Gilligan’s <a href=\"https://ethicsofcare.org/carol-gilligan/\">Ethic of Care</a>. Gilligan’s argument that the human condition is one of connectedness, one of interdependence echo’s <a href=\"http://environmentalhumanities.org/arch/vol6/6.7.pdf\">Donna Haraway’s call</a> for us to recognize and honor the interconnections among people, plants, animals, and the planet in an effort to create, foster, and defend places of refuge.\n\n\n\nFor Gilligan, a feminist ethic of care is an ethic of resistance to the injustices inherent in patriarchy (<strong>meaning the association of care and caring with women rather than with humans, the feminizing of care work, as well as the rendering of care as less important, though linked with, justice</strong>). The Library is a space where this resistance and radical care work can be, and is currently, practiced.\n\n\n\nInterconnectedness is a major tenant of the Ethic of Care described by Gilligan. Within the library, the processes of what collections we buy, which collaborations we lend time to, are interconnected to issues of funding, user stats, time allocations, and a myriad of other concerns. Much of the negotiations and decisions are obscured from other departments and our patrons. One way to challenge this is to create and share open workflows.\n\n\n\nOpen Workflows, more than open data and open access (<strong>both of which are important</strong>), give scope to protocols, tools, practices, and rationales. Practicing transparency can create deeper understanding of the very real constraints libraries are working within. For example, and I think the statute of limitations has run out now . . . hopefully . . . in one of my former positions, I had a patron upset because a very expensive resource was being canceled. I sat down with this patron, walked them through the committee’s decision process. I did all the things I was not supposed to do- I shared the general the budget, shared the cost of the canceled resource (It costs about x thousand dollars per year, we have about 3 people using it), and then we worked together to identify the specifics of what they needed in order to find that information in a different database.[/fusion_text][fusion_imageframe image_id=\"19317\" style_type=\"none\" stylecolor=\"\" hover_type=\"none\" bordersize=\"\" bordercolor=\"\" borderradius=\"\" align=\"center\" lightbox=\"yes\" gallery_id=\"gallery\" lightbox_image=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/capabilities.png\" alt=\"\" link=\"\" linktarget=\"_self\" hide_on_mobile=\"small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_direction=\"left\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_offset=\"\"]http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/capabilities-980x610.png[/fusion_imageframe][fusion_text]Open Workflows clarify the constraints an institution is working within, can detail who is responsible for making decisions, what information goes into those decisions, helps us say no to projects that are beyond the scope of the work we do (hopefully with pointers to who else on campus or within the community does accommodate that work). Moreover, openness means others can reuse it, expand it, fix it. Openness further gives us a platform to talk about the costs and effort of service.\n\n\n\nIn libraries, care on par with justice, includes educating ourselves and our collaborators ( including students, community members, staff, and faculty) about privacy online. <a href=\"https://libraryfreedomproject.org/\">Library Freedom Project</a> is a partnership among librarians, technologists, attorneys, and privacy advocates which aims to address the problems of surveillance by making real the promise of intellectual freedom in libraries.Their focus is teaching librarians about surveillance threats, privacy rights and responsibilities, and digital tools to stop surveillance, with the hope to create a privacy-centric paradigm shift in libraries and the communities they serve.\n\n\n\nThe Library Freedom Project, responding to increased surveillance online, has a Privacy Toolkit for Librarians, makes clear its funders and funding model, as well as a wide-range of resources for learning and advocating for privacy online.[/fusion_text][fusion_imageframe image_id=\"19318\" style_type=\"none\" stylecolor=\"\" hover_type=\"none\" bordersize=\"\" bordercolor=\"\" borderradius=\"\" align=\"center\" lightbox=\"yes\" gallery_id=\"gallery\" lightbox_image=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/open-workflows.png\" alt=\"Open Workflows\" link=\"\" linktarget=\"_self\" hide_on_mobile=\"small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_direction=\"left\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_offset=\"\"]http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/open-workflows-980x614.png[/fusion_imageframe][fusion_text]\n\nThe mission of The Library Freedom Project is one way to enact of the Ethic of Care. Specifically, we teach others to use digital resources, teach digital literacies, but we do not make clear what data is collected or by whom or for what purposes when people use library services or through general internet use.\n\n\n\nCould we include digital privacy workshops within the rich range of existing <a href=\"http://www.lib.umd.edu/tl/workshops/teaching--learning-workshops\">Teaching &amp; Learning workshops</a> or as a quick-start guide alongside managing data and resources within the excellent Research Commons services? How can we make transparent our own efforts to better understand governmental and corporate data gathering from our vendor services? What collaborators would we need to identify to build relationships across campus? How can we identify our own risks and communicate those out to our colleagues within the library and beyond?\n\n\n\nOne approach to such questions is to center the library as a base for grassroots activism–around digital privacy as well as endangered data. The Library is a vibrant center of intellectual life and is situated at a crossroads of campus. Positioned in this way, grassroots efforts, like those of Endangered Data Week, can activate the broad networks of collaborators spread across campus.\n\n\n\nIn the case of UMD’s <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/research/endangered-data-week/\">Endangered Data Week</a>, representatives from the Library, iSchool, and MITH organized an interdisciplinary panel on the complex topic of endangered data, a hands-on workshop for personal data archiving best practices, as well as hosted a webinar. These events were held in conjunction with international Endangered Data Week which is dedicated to highlighting threats to data security and preservation.\n\n\n\nThe collaboration was one of distributed labor, various members of the organizing team taking a lead on a portion of the weeks events. It relied on email and shared google docs to keep communication flowing. And importantly, this kind of collaboration can serve as a model for other grassroot efforts of interest to the Library and the Library’s communities.\n\n\n\nA final example of Libraries enacting the Ethic of Care is UVa’s <a href=\"https://guides.lib.virginia.edu/music/makingnoise\">Making Noise Series</a> hosting <a href=\"http://racheldevorah.studio/works/overmorrow/\">Overmorrow</a> by Rachel Devorah Wood Rome, which is a sonification of gun violence in the United States. Making Noise hosted both a performance of the sonification and a discussion afterwards. The library became a space to talk about gun violence in the United States, specifically police violence against black bodies, as well as a space to reflect upon whiteness, the pitfalls of empathy in sonifying violence predominantly against black people, the role and responsibilities of white researchers engaged in anti-racist work, specifically when that anti-racist work is about violence and death. These are not easy conversations. Rachel Trapp has written about the evolution of Overmorrow and the work still to be done in order not to reinscribe violence with her work.\n\n\n\nLibraries can be a space to elevate conversations of our interconnectedness. Taking the lead from The Crunk Feminist Collective, the library can create space of support and camaraderie by building community through fellowships, debates, challenges, and support of each other as struggle together.\n\n\n\nAs I mentioned in the beginning, the editors of the journal <a href=\"http://salvage.zone/in-print/order-prevails-in-washingston/\">Salvage</a>, wrote “The infrastructures against social misery have yet to be built.” Applying Gilligan’s ethic of care, engaging with the principles and elements of Advocacy by Design, Libraries, specifically, our library, can begin the speculative work of sketching out and practicing what those infrastructures against social misery look like. Much of this work is not speculative; As Bess Sadler and Chris Bourg assert:\n\n\n\n<strong>The means of production for the archives of humanity are up for grabs, and within our reach is the possibility of new production methods that resist the recreation of existing patterns of exclusion and marginalization.</strong>\n\n\n\nWe can put concerns about people at the center of everything we do, inviting our patrons to be collaborators\n\nWe can work to build a vocabulary of advocacy,\n\nWe can strive to be transparent in our decision making and policies, about what service means\n\nWe can transform our hiring and retention practices\n\nWe can include codes of conduct for our conferences, communication channels, and projects.\n\nWe can use library space to foster grassroots organizing around issues like privacy and endangered data\n\nWe can use library space to talk about our anti-racist and anti-violence commitments, collaborations, and research\n\n\n\nThese are foundations to do the speculative work together, in a critically engaged way, and with an approach that is conscious of the effects of our decisions.[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]",

Digital edition projects that create TEI documents typically publish them on the web by transforming TEI into HTML to be displayed by a browser. Learning how to transform TEI is not difficult, but not very straightforward either, and publishing online often requires costly resources. This workshop will introduce its participants to an alternative workflow that does not require writing complex transformation scripts and relies on free platforms such as GitHub Pages for publishing TEI texts on the web. The workshop will teach: 1) how to write simple TEI encoded texts; 2) how to create a code repository on GitHub to publish TEI; 3) how to style these texts using CSS. We encourage participants of all skill levels: beginners will learn a straightforward way of publishing simple TEI texts, and more experienced TEI users will be introduced to a new publishing approach that takes full advantage of the latest HTML developments. We will introduce CETEIcean, a JavaScript tool for displaying TEI directly in the browser.</span>\n\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><b>Wednesday May 31, 9:00 AM - 11:00 AM\n\n</b></span><b>Peer Reviewing in Sign Languages</b></h4>\n\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Instructors: Patrick Boudreault (Gallaudet University), Ted Supalla (Georgetown University Medical Center)</span></i>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Placed within a wider context of sign language publishing, this workshop addresses how the traditional processes of scholarly peer-review prevent both the submission and review of original video articles in sign languages (SL), which are inherently embodied. Our case study will be the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Deaf Studies Digital Journal </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(DSDJ), which publishes scholarly and creative work in SL. Since its inception, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">DSDJ</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> reviewers have submitted their reviews in writing instead of SL because there is no conventional writing system for them. While there is no platform that would address this barrier efficiently, a digital media based web-app has been specifically developed to carry out the process. Participants will have the opportunity to experience this web-app first-hand, evaluating the outcome of various scenarios, ranging from anonymous response to an open collaborative process. The ultimate objective of the workshop is to foster an in-depth discussion of the reasons for diverging from the traditional approach to peer-review in order to give primacy to embodied “texts.”</span>\n\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><b>Wednesday May 31, 11:00 AM - 1:00 PM\n\n</b></span><b>Working with Web Archives</b></h4>\n\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Instructors: Ed Summers and Purdom Lindblad (MITH)</span></i>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In this workshop participants will be introduced to practices of working with the web as material in their research. The web is popularly imagined as a cloud that is ever present and constantly changing--a medium which resists fixity and the archive. And yet the experience of using the web is the result of a discrete configuration of networks, software and hardware. We can interact with the web using tools and techniques to save and organize its content for our research. Social media, blogs and websites have created a vast proliferation of text that blurs the notion of authority while presenting new opportunities for scholarship. In this workshop participants will get hands on experience using web archiving services like the Internet Archive and Web Recorder to use and create Web Archives. We will also look at practices for screen capture and annotation for annotating the web as part of your research using Hypothes.is. Finally we will examine social media archives as provided by Twitter and Facebook and think about how these can be used in scholarly research.</span>\n\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><b>Wednesday May 31, 2:00 PM - 5:00 PM\n\n</b></span><b>Doing .txtual Scholarship</b></h4>\n\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Instructors: Matthew Kirschenbaum and Porter Olsen (University of Maryland)</span></i>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This 3-hour workshop will introduce participants to what we might provisionally term “.txtual scholarship.” The goal is to furnish some of the knowledge necessary to bring the personal computer (and its associated storage media) into view as a distinct (and distinctly material) venue for textual scholarship. How should digital files be recovered and evaluated alongside of manuscript witnesses? How are we to establish provenance and authority in such cases? What would be the equivalent of a facsimile for a document written on a computer? What does it even mean to practice “textual” scholarship when text itself has now become a verb? After an initial conversation around such questions (based on readings to be circulated beforehand), we will spend time working with hardware and software from MITH’s extensive collection of vintage computers. Matt Kirschenbaum will also discuss some of the considerations in acquiring, maintaining, and utilizing older computers for textual research. We will then turn to one of the most iconic artifacts of personal computing, the floppy disk. Porter Olsen will demonstrate a complete workflow for recovering data from both 5¼- and 3½-inch diskettes, as well as various tools that can then be used to explore that data, or even bring files back to life in a simulacrum of their original environment using emulation. No special background knowledge is required or assumed, but prospective participants should state a rationale for their interest and indicate whether they are planning or pursuing a related project.</span>\n\n<h4><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\"><b>Wednesday May 31, 2:00 P</b><b>M</b><b> - 5:00 PM\n\n</b></span><b>Minimal Editions: come with a text, leave with an accessible digital edition</b></h4>\n\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Instructors: Amanda Visconti (University of Virginia), Alexander Gil (Columbia University)</span></i>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This workshop focuses on \"minimal editions,\" a computational approach to editing that addresses accessibility both in terms of who gets to make adequately customized digital editions and who can access these editions once they're created. Participants will learn how to make a digital edition of their selected texts in a few hours using a Jekyll theme designed for textual editors based on minimal computing principles and focused on legibility, durability, ease and flexibility. The tutorial also serves as an introduction to markdown, the terminal, plain-text editors, versioning, and static site generation. These technologies not only work well for editions, but they can also be the foundation for many other types of documentary-based work and are a friendly on-ramp for scholars curious about getting started with coding. No previous technical expertise is required to participate. The workshop will begin with an overview of minimal computing and minimal editions, proceed to a tutorial where participants are walked through creating their own editions, and end with time for Q&amp;A about further customization or advanced needs for these minimal editions.</span>\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n<b>About TEXTUAL EMBODIMENTS: </b>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This year's STS conference, Textual Embodiments, will engage a range of issues involving the materiality of texts, including their physical, virtual, and performative manifestations as objects that can decay or break down and can potentially be repaired and sustained over time. It also concerns the processes of inclusion and exclusion through which bodies of texts take shape in the form of editions, archives, collections, and exhibition building, as well as the ethical responsibilities faced by textual scholars, archivists, conservationists, media archaeologists, digital resource creators, and cultural heritage professionals engaging in these processes.</span>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/sts2017\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Click here to view the conference website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, which now includes the program schedule and list of speakers (subject to change), a link to register, and information on hotel reservations and other logistics.</span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We are beyond excited to host this fantastic event, and hope to see many of your faces here in College Park in late May!!</span>",

If you’ve had a chance to visit MITH’s current location, then you’ve likely noticed its modern, open, and spacious design. And yet, for all its comforts, for all its natural light streaming in from the windows that comprise its northern wall, I still find myself missing our dark corner of the McKeldin basement from time to time: its cubicles, its cramped breakroom, Matthew Kirschenbaum’s cave-like office with frankensteinian hardware filling every square inch, and especially its oddly shaped conference room, packed to the gills and overflowing into the hallway every Tuesday at 12:30 for Digital Dialogues.\n\n\n\nIn preparation for the move, we delved into those nooks and crannies to inventory the computers and other equipment that had accumulated over the years. MITH is a place that is interested in the materiality of computing—and it shows. Boxes of old media could be found under one cubicle, while a stack of keyboards—whose corresponding computers had long since been recycled—could be found under another. A media cabinet near the entrance contained a variety of game systems from the <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20150709192456/http://pvw.illinois.edu:80/pvw/\">Preserving Virtual Worlds</a> project, and legacy computer systems, now proudly displayed on MITH’s “spline,” jockied for pride of place on the breakroom table. Tucked away here and there in MITH’s McKeldin offices were a host of retired computer hardware—old enough to have been replaced, but still too modern to merit a listing in <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/vintage-computers/\">MITH’s Vintage Computers collection</a>. Among these systems were two large, black IBM server towers, twice the size and weight of your typical PC. As I lugged them onto the cart in preparation for the move, I couldn’t help but wonder what these servers had been used for, when and why had they been retired, and what data might still be recoverable from them?\n\n\n\nA few months ago, I got the chance to find out when I was asked to capture disk images of these servers (a disk image is a sector-by-sector copy of all the data that reside on a storage medium such as a hard disk or CD-ROM). Disk images of these servers would significantly increase access to the data they contained, and also make it possible for MITH to analyze them using the <a href=\"http://www.bitcurator.com\">BitCurator</a> suite of digital forensics tools developed by MITH and <a href=\"http://sils.unc.edu/\">UNC’s School of Information and Library Science</a>. With BitCurator we would be able to, among other things, identify deleted or hidden files, search the disk images for particular or sensitive information, and generate human and machine-readable reports detailing file types, checksums and file sizes. The tools and capabilities provided by BitCurator offered MITH an opportunity to revisit its legacy web servers and retrospectively consider preservation decisions in a way that was not possible before. However, before we could conduct any such analysis, we first had to be able to access the data on the servers and capture that data in disk image form. It is tackling that specific challenge, accessing and imaging the servers’ hard drives, that I want to focus on in this blog post.\n\n\n\nAs Trevor described in his <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/stewarding-digital-humanities-work-on-the-web-at-mith/\" target=\"_blank\">recent post on MITH’s digital preservation practices</a>, servers are one important site where complex institutional decisions about digital curation and preservation are played out. As such, I see two communities that have a vested interest in understanding the particular preservation challenges posed by server hardware. First, the digital humanities community where DH centers routinely host their own web content and will need, inevitably, to consider migration and preservation strategies associated with transitioning web infrastructure. These transitions may come in the form of upgrading to newer, more powerful web servers, or migrating from self-hosted servers to cloud-based virtual servers. In either event, what to do with the retired servers remains a critical question. And second, the digital preservation community who may soon see (if they haven’t already) organizations contributing web, email or file servers as important institutional records to be archived along with the contents of their filing cabinets and laptops. Given the needs of these two communities, I hope this blog post will begin a larger conversation about the how and why of web server preservation.\n\n<h4><b>Khelone and Minerva</b></h4>\n\nThe two systems represented by those heavy, black IBM towers were a development server named “Khelone” and a production server named “Minerva.” These machines were MITH’s web servers from 2006 to 2009. When they were retired, the websites they hosted were migrated to new, more secure servers. MITH staff (primarily Greg Lord and Doug Reside) developed a transition plan where they evaluated each website on the servers for security and stability and then, based on that analysis, decided how each website should be migrated to the new servers. Some sites could be migrated in their entirety, but a number of websites had security vulnerabilities that dictated only a partial migration. (Later in the summer MITH’s Lead Developer Ed Summers will share a little more about the process of migrating dynamic websites.) After the websites had been migrated to the new servers, Khelone and Minerva, which had been hosted in the campus data center, were collected and returned to MITH. The decision to hold on to these servers showed great foresight and is what allowed me to go back six years after they had been retired and delve into MITH’s digital nooks and crannies.\n\n\n\n[fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=\"yes\" overflow=\"visible\"][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=\"1_1\" background_position=\"left top\" background_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" border_color=\"\" border_style=\"solid\" spacing=\"yes\" background_image=\"\" background_repeat=\"no-repeat\" padding=\"\" margin_top=\"0px\" margin_bottom=\"0px\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_direction=\"left\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" center_content=\"no\" min_height=\"none\"][caption id=\"attachment_14138\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"418\"]<img class=\"wp-image-14138 \" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/20150708_104704-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"Khelone &amp; Minerva - MITH's web servers c 2009\" width=\"418\" height=\"314\" /> Khelone &amp; Minerva - MITH's web servers c 2009[/caption]\n\n\n\nImaging and analyzing Khelone and Minerva’s hard drives is a task I eagerly took up because I have been interested in exploring how a digital forensics approach to digital preservation would differ between personal computing hardware (desktop computers, laptops and mobile devices) and server hardware. As I suspected, what I found was that there are both hardware and software differences between the two types of systems, and these differences significantly affect how one might go about preserving a server’s digital contents. In this post I will cover four common features of server hardware that may impede the digital humanities center manager’s or digital archivist’s ability to capture disk images of a server’s hard drives (I will write more about post-imaging BitCurator tools in subsequent posts). Those features are: 1) the use of SCSI hard drives, 2) drive access without login credentials, 3) accessing data on a RAID array, and 4) working with logical volumes. If those terms don’t mean anything to you, fear not! I will do my best to explain each of them and how a digital archivist might need to work with or around them when data held on server hardware.\n\n\n\nThis topic is necessarily technical, but for those less interested in the technical details than the broader challenge of preserving web server infrastructure, I have included TL;DR (Too Long; Didn’t Read) summaries of each section below.\n\n<h4><b>Server hardware vs. PC hardware</b></h4>\n\nWorkflows designed to capture born-digital content on carrier media (hard drives, floppy disk, optical disks, etc.) typically focus on collecting data from personal computing devices. This makes sense both because the majority of carrier media comes from personal computing and also because it fits the familiar framework of collecting the papers of an individual. The presumption in these workflows is that the carrier media can be removed from the computer, connected to a <a href=\"http://forensicswiki.org/wiki/Write_Blockers\">write blocker</a>, and accessed via a <a href=\"http://www.bitcurator.net/building-a-digital-curation-workstation-with-bitcurator-update/\">digital forensics workstation</a>. (See Marty Gengenbach’s paper “<a href=\"http://digitalcurationexchange.org/node/3690\">Mapping Digital Forensics Workflows in Collecting Institutions</a>” for example workflows.) Once connected to the workstation, the digital archivist can capture a disk image , scan the contents of the drive for viruses, search for personally identifiable information, generate metadata reports on the drive’s contents, and ultimately transfer the disk image and associated metadata to a digital repository. The challenge posed by server hardware, however, is that if the hard drives are removed from their original hardware environment, they can become unreadable, or the data they contain may only be accessible as raw bitstreams that cannot be reconstructed into coherent files. (I’m using “servers” as a generic term for different server types such as web, email, file, etc.) These factors necessitate a different approach. Specifically, that when archiving born-digital content on server hardware, the safest (and sometimes only) way to access the server’s hard drives is by accessing them while they are still connected to the server.\n\n\n\nAs a general rule, commercial servers and personal computers use different data bus types (the data bus is the system component that moves data from a disk drive to the CPU for processing). And unfortunately, currently available write blockers and disk enclosures/docking stations do not support the data bus type commonly used in server hardware. Over the years there have been a number of different data bus types. From the late 1980’s to the early 2000’s most desktop systems included hard drives that used a bus type called IDE (Integrated Device Electronics). That bus technology has since given way to Serial ATA (or, SATA), which is found in almost all computers today. However, servers almost always included hard drives that used a SCSI data bus because of SCSI’s higher sustained data throughput. So, while it’s common for a write blocker to have pinout connections for both IDE and SATA (see the WiebeTech ComboDock described in my <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/digital-curation-workstation/\">blog post covering digital forensics hardware</a>), there are none on the market that support any type of SCSI devices (I’d be happily proven wrong if anyone knows of a write blocker that supports SCSI devices). This means that if you want to capture data from a legacy server with SCSI hard drives, instead of removing the drives and connecting them to a digital forensics workstation via a write blocker—as one would do with IDE or SATA hard drives—your best, and maybe only, solution is to leave the drives in the server, boot it up, and capture the data from the running system.\n\n\n\nThere is an alternative approach that might make sense if you anticipate working with SCSI hard drives regularly. Special expansion cards (called “controller cards”) can be purchased that allow SCSI drives to connect to your typical desktop computer. Adding such a card to your digital curation workstation if, as stated above, you anticipate processing data on SCSI hard drives on a regular basis.\n\n\n\n<i>TL;DR #1: Servers almost always use SCSI hard drives, not the more common IDE or SATA drives. Write blockers and disk enclosures/docking stations do not support SCSI drives, so if you want to access the data contained on a server, the best solution is to access them via the server itself.</i>\n\n<h4><b>The LiveCD Approach</b></h4>\n\nHow then to best access the data on hard drives still attached to the server? There are two options: The first is simply to boot up the computer, log in, and either capture a disk image or copy over selected files. The second option is what is called a “liveCD” approach. In this case you put the liveCD (or DVD as the case may be) in the drive and have the server boot up off of that disk. The system will boot into a temporary environment where all of the components of the computer are running <i>except</i> the hard drives. In this temporary environment you can capture disk images of the drives or mount the drives in a read-only state for appraisal and analysis.\n\n\n\nFrom a digital forensics perspective, the first option is problematic, bordering on outright negligent. Booting directly from the server’s hard drives means that you will, unavoidably, write data to the drive. This may be something as seemingly innocuous as writing to the boot logs as the system starts up. But what if one of the things you wanted to find out was the last time the server had been up and running as a server? Booting from the server’s hard drive will overwrite the boot logs and replace the date of the last active use with the present date. Further, capturing a disk image from an actively mounted drive means that any running processes may be writing data to the drive during the imaging process, potentially overwriting log files and deleted files.\n\n\n\nIt may also be impossible to log into the server at all. It is common for servers to employ a “single sign on” technology where the server authenticates a user via an authentication server instead of the local system. This was the case with Khelone and Minerva, making the liveCD approach the only viable course of action.\n\n\n\nBooting from a liveCD is a common digital forensics approach because even though the system is up and running, the hard drives are inaccessible—essentially absent from the system unless the examiner actively mounts them in the temporary environment. There a number of <a href=\"https://www.linux.com/distributions\">Linux based liveCDs</a>, including <a href=\"http://wiki.bitcurator.net/index.php?title=Main_Page\">BitCurator</a>’s, which would have been the ideal liveCD for my needs. Unfortunately, the old MITH servers had CD-ROM, not DVD drives, and the BitCurator liveCD is DVD size at 2.5GB. An additional impediment to using BitCurator is that BitCurator is built on the 64-bit version of Ubuntu Linux, while the Intel Xeon processors in these servers only supported 32-bit operating systems.\n\n\n\nWith BitCurator unavailable I chose to use <a href=\"http://www.ubuntu-mini-remix.org/\">Ubuntu Mini Remix</a>, a version of Ubuntu Linux specifically paired down to fit on a CD. Ubuntu has an official <a href=\"https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD\">minimal liveCD/installation CD</a> but it is a bit <i>too</i> minimal and doesn’t include some necessary features for the disk capture work I needed to do.\n\n\n\n<i>TL;DR #2:</i> <i>Use a “liveCD” to gain access to legacy servers. Be careful to note the type of optical media drive (CD or DVD), if the system can boot from a USB drive, and whether or not the server has support for 64 bit operating systems so you can choose a liveCD that will work.</i>\n\n<h4><b>Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks (RAID)</b></h4>\n\nOnce the server is up and running on the liveCD, you may want to either capture a disk image or mount the hard drives (read only, of course) to appraise their content. On personal computing hardware this is fairly straightforward. However, servers have a need for both fault tolerance and speed, which leads most server manufacturers to pair multiple drives together to create what’s called a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID\">RAID, or Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks</a>. There are a number of different RAID types, but for the most part a RAID does one of three things:\n\n<ol>\n\n\t<li>“Stripe” data between two or more disks for increased read/write times (called RAID 0)</li>\n\n\t<li>“Mirror” data across two or more disks to build redundancy (called RAID 1, see diagram below)</li>\n\n\t<li>Data striping with parity checks to prevent data loss (RAID 2-6)</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n[/fusion_builder_column][fusion_builder_column type=\"1_1\" background_position=\"left top\" background_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" border_color=\"\" border_style=\"solid\" spacing=\"yes\" background_image=\"\" background_repeat=\"no-repeat\" padding=\"\" margin_top=\"0px\" margin_bottom=\"0px\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_direction=\"left\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" center_content=\"no\" min_height=\"none\"][caption id=\"attachment_14119\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"315\"]<img class=\"wp-image-14119 size-full\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/raid1.jpg\" alt=\"Diagram of RAID 1 Array. Photo credit Intel\" width=\"315\" height=\"288\" /> Diagram of RAID 1 Array. Photo credit Intel[/caption]\n\n\n\nRegardless of the RAID type, in all cases a RAID makes multiple disks appear to be a single disk. This complicates the work of the digital archivists significantly because when hard drives are configured in a RAID, they may not be able to stand alone as single disk, particularly in the case of RAID 0 where data is striped between the disks in the array.\n\n\n\nAs with SCSI hard drives, virtually all servers configure their hard drives in a RAID, and the old MITH servers were no exception. It is easy to determine if a server has hard drives configured in a RAID by typing “fdisk -l”, which reads the partition information from each hard drive visible to the operating system. The “fdisk -l” command will print a table that gives details on each drive and partition. Drives that are part of a raid will be labeled “Linux raid autodetect” under the “system” column of the table. What is less apparent is which <i>type</i> of RAID the server is using. To determine the RAID type, you use an application called “mdadm” (Multi Disk Administration), which, once downloaded and installed, revealed that the drives on Khelone and Minerva were configured in a RAID 1 (mirroring). There were four drives on each server, with each drive paired with an identical drive so that if one failed, the other drive would seamlessly kick in and allow the server to continue functioning without any downtime.\n\n\n\nBecause the drives were mirroring rather than striping data, it was possible to essentially ignore the RAID and capture a disk image of the first of the drives that constitute the array and still have a valid, readable disk image. However, this is only the case when dealing with RAID 1 (mirroring). However, if a server employs a RAID type that stripes data, such as RAID 0, then you must recreate the full raid in order to have access to the data. If you image a drive from a RAID 0, you essentially only get half of the data, resulting in so many meaningless ones and zeros.\n\n\n\n<i>TL;DR #3: Servers frequently deploy a redundancy technology called RAID to ensure the seamless rollover from a failed drive to a backup. When creating disk images of server hard drives one must first identify the type of RAID being used and from that information determine whether to capture a disk image of the raw device (the unmounted hard drive), or reassemble the RAID and capture the disk image from the disks running in the RAID.</i>\n\n<h4><b>Logical Volumes</b></h4>\n\nThe fourth and final server technology I’ll discuss in this post is what is called a “logical volume.” For simplicity’s sake, I’ll draw a distinction between a “physical volume” and a “logical volume.” A physical volume would be all the space on a single drive; its size (its <i>volume</i>) is limited by its physical capacity. If I connect a physical drive to my computer and format it, its volume would only ever be what its physical capacity allowed. A logical volume, by comparison, has the capacity to span multiple drives to create a single, umbrella-like volume. The volume’s size can now be expanded by adding additional drives to the logical volume (see the diagram below). In practice this means that, like a RAID array, a logical volume allows the user to to connect multiple hard disks to a system but have the operating system treat them as a single drive. This capability allows the user to add space to the logical volume on an as-needed basis, so server administrators create logical volumes on servers where they anticipate the need to add more drive space in the future.\n\n\n\n[/fusion_builder_column][fusion_builder_column type=\"1_1\" background_position=\"left top\" background_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" border_color=\"\" border_style=\"solid\" spacing=\"yes\" background_image=\"\" background_repeat=\"no-repeat\" padding=\"\" margin_top=\"0px\" margin_bottom=\"0px\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_direction=\"left\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" center_content=\"no\" min_height=\"none\"][caption id=\"attachment_14120\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\"]<img class=\"wp-image-14120 size-full\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/lvg.png\" alt=\"Diagram of a Logical Volume. Image credit The Fedora Project\" width=\"500\" height=\"262\" /> Diagram of a Logical Volume. Image credit The Fedora Project[/caption]\n\n\n\nThe hard drives on Minerva, the production server, were configured in a logical volume as well as a RAID. This meant that in addition to reconstructing the RAID with mdadm, I had to download a tool called lvm (Linux Volume Manager) to mount the logical volume, which I then used to mount and access the contents of the drives. While I generally advocate the use of disk images for preservation, in this case it may make more sense to capture a logical copy of the data (that is, just the data visible to the operating system and not a complete bitstream). The reason for this is that in order to access the data from a disk image, you must once again use lvm to mount the logical volume. This additional step may be difficult for future users. It is, however, possible to mount a logical volume contained on a disk image in BitCurator, which I’ll detail in a subsequent post.\n\n\n\n<i>TL;DR #4: A logical volume is a means of making multiple drives appear to be a single volume. If a server employs a logical volume, digital archivists should take that fact into account when they decide whether to capture a forensic disk image or a logical copy of the data on the drive.</i>\n\n<h4><b>Revisiting Digital MITH</b></h4>\n\nSo why go through this? Why heft these old servers out of the storage closet and examine images of systems long-since retired? For me and for MITH it comes down to understanding our digital spaces much like our physical spaces. We have all had that moment when, for whatever reason, we find ourselves digging through boxes for that thing we think we need, only to find that thing we had forgotten about, but in fact need more than whatever it was we started digging for in the first place. So it was with Khelone and Minerva; what began as something of a test platform for BitCurator tools opened up a window to the past, to <i>digital </i>MITH circa 2009. And like their physical corollary, Khelone and Minerva were full of nooks and crannies. These servers hosted course pages for classes taught by past and present University of Maryland faculty, the personal websites of MITH staff, and versions of all the websites hosted by MITH in 2009, including those that weren’t able to be migrated to the new servers due to the security concerns mentioned above. In short, these servers were a snapshot of MITH in 2009—the technologies they were using, the fellows they were working with, the projects they were undertaking, and more. In this case the whole was truly greater than the sum of its parts (or the sum of its hosted websites). These servers—now accessible to MITH’s current managers as disk images—are a digital space captured in time that tell us as much about MITH as they do about any of the projects the servers hosted.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding web servers in this way has significant implications for digital humanities centers and how they preserve project websites as well as their own institutional history. An atomized approach to preserving project websites decontextualizes them from the center’s oeuvre. Any effort to capture a representative institutional history must demonstrate the interrelated web of projects that define the center’s scholarship. Elements such as overlaps between participants, technologies that were shared or expanded upon between projects, funder relationships, and project partnerships, to name a few, form a network of relationships that is visible when websites are viewed in their original server context. However, this network becomes harder to see the moment a website is divorced from its server. In MITH's case, examination of these disk images showed the planning and care with which staff had migrated individual digital projects. Nonetheless, having this additional, holistic view of previous systems is a welcome new capability. It is perhaps asking too much of a DH center to spend already limited system administration resources creating, say, biannual disk images of their web servers. However, when those inevitable moments of server migration and transition come about, they can be approached as an opportunity to capture a digital iteration of the center and its work, and in so doing, hold on to that context.\n\n\n\nFrom a digital preservation perspective, I believe that we need to adopt a holistic approach to archiving web servers. When we capture a website, we have a website, and if we capture a bunch of website we have… a bunch of websites, which is fine. But a web <i>server</i> is a different species; it is a digital space that at any given moment can tell us as much about an organization as a visit to their physical location. A disk image of an institution’s web server, then, is more than just a place to put websites—it is a snapshot of the organization’s history that is, in its way, still very much alive.[/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]",

The EDUCE project is developing a non-destructive volumetric scanning framework to enable access to such objects without the need to physically open them.  This work is based on earlier achievements in digital restoration that have recently been applied to the Venetus A in order to digitally flatten its pages.  In this presentation I will discuss the overarching theme of digital restoration and will present current progress on the EDUCE project and results from work on the Venetus A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nW.

The theoretical knowledge and practical skills of information science, librarianship, and archival science represent a vital component of the skill set that will be required to succeed in the rapidly transforming landscape of the academy and the wider society.\n\nDigital Humanities Data Curation institutes will serve as opportunities for participants with all levels of expertise—from beginners to the most advanced—to receive guidance in understanding the role of data curation in enriching humanities research projects. By the conclusion of each institute, participants will be adept at formulating solutions for existing challenges and will be able to document their data curation strategies in the form of data curation plans and strategic risk assessments, key elements of innovative digital scholarship.\n\nA core resource for the Institute will be the Digital Humanities Curation Guide (DH Curation: <a title=\"DH Curation\" href=\"http://guide.dhcuration.org\">guide.dhcuration.org</a>) developed at GSLIS. The Guide allows instructors and participants to share scholarly knowledge about literature, tools, projects, and standards relevant to curating humanities data. A forum through which knowledge developed at the institute can be shared with the broader research community, the Guide will allow for the aggregation of resources and responses from across the Institute’s three events. Julia Flanders (WWP) and Dorothea Salo (Faculty Associate in the School of Library and Information Studies at the University of Wisconsin at Madison) will serve as co-instructors alongside Muñoz for the three institute events and will contribute resources to the Guide.\n\nApplications to join this cohort of scholars focused on discipline-specific curation practices and skills will be announced in late fall 2012 with the Institute beginning in Spring 2013.

Since its founding in 1999, MITH has become internationally recognized as one of the leading centers of its kind, distinguished by the cultural diversity so central to its identity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocated in McKeldin Library at the heart of the campus, MITH is the University's primary intellectual hub for scholars and practitioners of digital humanities, new media, and cyberculture, as well as new home of the Electronic Literature Organization, the most prominent international group devoted to the writing, publishing and reading of electronic literature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProjects have typically taken the form of electronic editions, scholarly databases, or high-end teaching materials (examples here: ). MITH is also increasingly supporting research in creative new media. MITH's house research includes projects in text mining, visualization, digital libraries, electronic publishing, and digital preservation. We collaborate actively with allied campus units, including the University Libraries, the College of Information Science, and the Human Computer Interaction Lab. Situated just outside of Washington DC, MITH also offers all of the opportunities that come from the libraries, museums, and cultural institutions of the area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to participating in MITH's house research, the Assistant Director will bear primary responsibility for the conceptualization and development of MITH's Fellows' projects and the supervision of a staff that includes a full-time Web designer, graduate assistants, and interns. We are therefore seeking a data architecture specialist experienced with both relational database and XML data representation. Ability to work at the command-line level with Unix/Linux based applications such as mySql is required, and preference will be given to candidates with scripting and programming expertise. Strong organizational and project management skills are also mandatory, as are excellent communication skills. A humanities background is welcome and desirable. MA, MLS, or Ph.D. preferred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Assistant Director is a full-time staff position at the University, with benefits. Salary commensurate with experience, ranging from $50,000-$63,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo apply, please send a letter of application, CV, and contact information for three references. Best consideration by August 1, 2006. Application materials may be sent electronically to mith@umd.edu or to Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH, McKeldin Library, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742. Consideration of applications to begin immediately. Applications from women and minorities, as well as faculty at HBCU's is encouraged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNeil Fraistat, Director\r\n\r\nMatthew Kirschenbaum, Associate Director",

This first session is a reconvening of our Ferguson constituency, comprising faculty and students who attended one of the two first sessions in October and December at MITH, or who expressed interest separately.\n\nThe discussions that took place at both prior events allowed us to synthesize your input and stated research interests in this topic, which we used to begin planning for several ongoing MITH Digital Humanities Incubator sessions that will occur throughout February 2015 as part of Black History Month, and possibly beyond.  These sessions will constitute MITH's contribution to the University of Maryland teach-ins occurring throughout campus in Spring 2015.\n\nIn this first session on January 27th, MITH will begin by reviewing previous discussions and outcomes and then we will discuss our plans for the following future sessions, inviting further feedback from the group.  We also invite others who might be interested to join us.\n\n<strong>Session II: Hands on demonstration of Tools for Collecting Social Media</strong> (Date TBD)\n<ul>\n\t<li>   Existing Off the Shelf Tools</li>\n\t<li>   Command Line Tools</li>\n\t<li>   DIY Tools</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Session III: Ethics, Rights, Data Management</strong> (Date TBD)\n<ul>\n\t<li>   Storing and Managing Collected Data</li>\n\t<li>   Sharing Data: Approaches and Legal Concerns</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Session IV: Basic Navigation and Analysis of Your Data</strong> (Date TBD)\n<ul>\n\t<li>   Metadata: What is in a Tweet?</li>\n\t<li>   Tools, Methods, Software for Working with JSON data</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Session V: Advanced Analytical Techniques</strong> (Date TBD)\n<ul>\n\t<li>   Network Analysis</li>\n\t<li>   Sentiment Analysis</li>\n\t<li>   Event Detection</li>\n</ul>\nTo RSVP, <a href=\"http://docs.google.com/forms/d/128cTxCPwBUHwqPds0TSfGsDCB3LBMu9TCipP7y9wNr0/viewform\" target=\"_blank\">please complete this form</a>.  If you have any questions, write us at <a href=\"mailto:mith@umd.edu\" target=\"_blank\">mith@umd.edu</a>.\n\n&nbsp;",

This means that we go out and spread out expertise in development of our own scholarly digital tools, the world of Digital Humanities, and our passion to support that world's importance. In the past, I have been an example of this by attending events in the European Union, Canada, and closer to home in the District of Columbia.\n\n<a href=\"http://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/GLAM\"><img class=\"wp-image-12856  aligncenter\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/800px-Glamlogo.jpg\" alt=\"800px-Glamlogo\" width=\"558\" height=\"141\" /></a>The mission of Galleries, Libraries, Museums and Archives CAMP (better known as GLAMCamp) clearly overlaps with the mission of MITH. GLAM is an international initiative to produce case studies and outreach for cultural heritage institutions to open up their data and make it more accessible to the online public. A list of their more recent projects can be found <a href=\"http://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/GLAM/Model_projects\">here</a>. Within the scope of their mission are organizing public outreach events such as attending Wikimania, setting up GLAM conferences, and setting up and hosting GLAMCamps.\n\n\n\nFriday, February 10th through Sunday, February 12th I attended the first DC-based GLAMCamp at the <a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/\">National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)</a> building in Penn Quarter. Behind the solemn doors and security blockades, we hacked, hashed out a GLAM/US Portal for all library and museum researchers, and networked in a space not more than 40 feet from the U.S. Constitution. Asaf Bartov, one of the colleagues from <a href=\"http://www.interedition.eu/\">Interedition</a> and the Small-Grants coordinator for the <a href=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Home\">Wikimedia Foundation</a>, invited me to this event to provide my Javascript interface expertise. What I eventually found at the event was a diverse group of dedicated Wikipedia contributors, educators, and general enthusiasts.\n\n\n\nThe proceedings of the conference were dutifully recorded in a wiki-embedded series of <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20130717202155/http://etherpad.wikimedia.org/GLAMcampDC\" target=\"_blank\">Etherpads</a> and <a href=\"http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/GLAMcamp_DC/Tech\" target=\"_blank\">wikis</a>. It is impressive how much is recorded and transcribed into these items. While a larger group was in the main conference area working on documentation for GLAM researchers to take part in wikis, I was in the “Techie Cave” slogging away with Asaf. Inspired by work done by Australian Digital Library to generate Wiki Citations automatically, we decided to work on a generalized Wiki Citation Engine to be used in any browser. What we ended up with is a rough prototype for generating citations using a Ruby Server and my Javascript: <a href=\"https://github.com/jdickie/GLAMCamp\">https://github.com/jdickie/GLAMCamp</a>. Despite the roughness, the participants were no less enthusiastic about the project when we presented at the closing on Sunday. Alongside our demonstration was a presentation on workflows for Bulk Uploading data into Wikipedia from GLAMs; a draft for a publication to hand out to GLAMs and get them informed and involved in the movement; and a GLAM/US portal wiki page for enticing more participants in the movement. Three days therefore became a very productive time within the confines of NARA.\n\n\n\nWhat can the University of Maryland and MITH benefit from such events as these? First, we broaden our knowledge base and network. The more institutions know about us, the more people we have supporting our mission, and, likewise, the more we are supporting others' missions. Second, MITH is not just a center for research - it is a development office for scholarly tools. Things such as workflow scenarios for Bulk Uploading to Wikimedia Commons and a citation engine for Wiki citations are things that scholars as well as GLAMs are interested to see available. Often it becomes necessary to work outside of the office and with other like minds to achieve this kind of development. Already, we are discussing presenting the proceedings and ideas from GLAM to the McKeldin Library administrators.\n\n\n\nLooking ahead, GLAM promises to be an exciting opportunity for MITH as well as the research world.[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]",

THATCamp has become an annual unconference hosted by GMU, and inspired regional digital humanities unconferences in France, Texas, Michigan, Ohio, and California. Lester will also draw from his experience engaging existing communities of interest through social networking sites to discuss the changing landscape of crowdsourcing and suggest ways that digital humanists can engage the public to answer research questions.\n\nDAVE LESTER, Assistant Director of MITH, has previously been employed by George Mason University’s Center for History &amp; New Media where he coordinated software development outreach for the Omeka Web publishing system used by libraries, museums, and archives. He was responsible for prototyping mobile applications for museums, fostering a collaborative open source community, and co-organizing THATCamp, an annual Digital Humanities “unconference” bringing together practitioners to collaborate and share their work. Prior to Mason, Dave was a Crossroads Fellow at Georgetown University’s Center for New Designs in Learning &amp; Scholarship, and helped redevelop the American Studies Crossroads Project Web site. He is also a HASTAC scholar, and his ongoing research focuses on place-based computing and the engagement of the public in crowdsourcing local history.\n\nComing up @MITH: There are no further talks scheduled until after Spring Break as we anticipate presentations from candidates visiting campus for the College of Arts and Humanities cluster search in Digital Humanities, Media, and Culture.\n\nView MITH’s complete Fall Speakers Schedule here:\n\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20100608231200/http://www.mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_spring_2010.pdf\n\nAll talks free and open to the public!\n\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-8927).",

Musical theatre seems particularly well-suited, though, to the multimedia capabilities of the modern PC.  This presentation will explore the ways in which electronic editions of musicals would not only be of use to musical theatre scholars, but might also help to develop a wider audience for artistically-minded (as opposed to commercially-driven) musicals.  This talk outlines the benefits offered by electronic editions and describes the steps taken by the author to develop an AJAX-based electronic edition of the 1998 musical Parade.\r\n\r\nDOUG RESIDE earned his PhD from the University of Kentucky in 2006. His dissertation was a multimedia musical theatre edition; while at Kentucky he also worked on several other humanities computing projects, including Kevin Kiernan's celebrated Electronic Boethius.

In this post, MITH's summer intern David Durden discusses his work on MITH's audiovisual collection of historic Digital Dialogues events.</em>\n\n\n\nI was brought on as a summer intern at MITH to work on a digital curation project involving <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/digital-dialogues/\">Digital Dialogues</a>, MITH’s signature events program featuring speakers from around the U.S., and occasionally beyond, which has been running for eleven years. The Digital Dialogues events program has documented the development of the digital humanities as well as the ideas and work of several of the pioneers of the field. However, as the digital humanities grew and developed, so did the technology used to record and edit the Digital Dialogues. This digital record must be curated and preserved in order to ensure that the Digital Dialogues events are accessible for many years to come.\n\n\n\nStaying current with changes in digital audio and video recording and editing resulted in a variety of media sources, file types, storage locations, and web-hosting services. MITH currently has a workflow for recent and future Digital Dialogues that ensures proper storage of raw video, systematized file naming-conventions, standards for video editing and the creation of web content, and redundant storage. This plan, in some form, must be retroactively applied to almost a decade of content.\n\n\n\nSince I was dealing with a variety of locations for content, the first task at hand was to consolidate media from all storage locations and resolve discrepancies and duplications. This resulted in aggregating all available content from an editing workstation, an external drive, an AWS server, and a local server. Once all the content was funneled into a singular location, I began the slow and tedious process of comparing files and folders. I was able to separate usable media from everything else and began moving content into a well-organized master directory that will be cloned into redundant storage for preservation. Future workflows will prevent discrepancies by having content be imported, named, organized, and edited on the local workstation and then copied to external storage sources to prevent duplication or accidental changes to archived content.\n\n\n\n[fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=\"yes\" overflow=\"visible\"][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=\"1_1\" background_position=\"left top\" background_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" border_color=\"\" border_style=\"solid\" spacing=\"yes\" background_image=\"\" background_repeat=\"no-repeat\" padding=\"\" margin_top=\"0px\" margin_bottom=\"0px\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_direction=\"left\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" center_content=\"no\" min_height=\"none\"][caption id=\"attachment_17757\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1360\"]<img class=\"wp-image-17757 size-full\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/MITH-DD-Workflow-New-Page.png\" alt=\"An example of the future data flow for Digital Dialogues videos\" width=\"1360\" height=\"852\" /> An example of the future data flow for Digital Dialogues videos[/caption]\n\n\n\nMITH had been successfully saving multiple copies of files across different storage devices, but many of these files reflected out-dated workflows and there were often several versions of the same file. The recording of Digital Dialogues went through several technological evolutions and left behind a messy file structure. Some source files were saved, others are missing. Some final product videos and recordings were duplicated across local storage devices, others exist solely in the Internet Archive and other web-hosting services. MITH’s early Digital Dialogues provide an example of the danger inherent in relying on singular storage locations and web-hosting services to archive digital assets. The file compression used by many services, as well as the possibility of service interruption, make web-hosting a ‘front-end access-only’ form of digital storage. The important thing to emphasize here is that once digital source media is lost, it is usually lost forever, which is why it is always necessary and recommended to have a data management plan ready at the onset of any digital project.\n\n\n\nData storage isn’t the only challenge that the Digital Dialogues collection presents as the collection has moved through different A/V editing workflows and standards. The Digital Dialogues transitioned from audio recording to video recording, as well as from using iMovie to Adobe Premiere to edit video, a transition that has left a considerable number of useless project files lingering about. The differences between the two video editing software suites are considerable and present several challenges to long term functionality. Adobe Premiere and iMovie handle the import of source media very differently. Premiere doesn’t actually import the source media, but instead creates a link to the file using a system path, which results in project files that are only a few hundred kilobytes in size. IMovie, however, stores a copy of the original media as well as a variety of program specific data, which greatly increases the size of the project folder. Additionally, Adobe Premiere allows for backwards compatibility to some degree, whereas iMovie does not, making Premiere a better choice for long term functionality of project files.\n\n\n\nThe links that Adobe Premiere creates to source media are problematic because, if the source media changes location or filename, the links are effectively broken and media must be relocated before any editing can occur. However, as long as the source media is preserved and is identifiable, it is a simple task to point Premiere to the correct location of the source. To ensure MITH’s future access to working project files (which is important if a derivative is lost and needs to be regenerated, or video formatting needs to be updated for a website), I created a well organized and descriptively named directory containing all project files and associated linked media. The current editing and curation plan involves each Digital Dialogue event being stored in a folder containing source media and the edited derivative. Before transferring any source media, an appropriate directory is created to store the files. Files are then transferred from an external storage device or camera to the video editing iMac work-station and stored in the appropriate event folder. The event folders are named using the following convention:\n\n<blockquote><strong>‘YYYYMMDD_SpeakerNameInCamelCase_AdditionalSpeakersSeparatedByUnderscores’</strong>.</blockquote>\n\nEvents are organized by season (e.g., Spring 2016) and stored in a season folder using the following convention:\n\n<blockquote><strong>‘YYYY-Season-Semester’</strong>.</blockquote>\n\nAll events for a season will be edited in a single Adobe Premiere project file that is located within the season folder. This reduces the amount of project files to manage and also streamlines the video editing process.\n\n\n\n[/fusion_builder_column][fusion_builder_column type=\"1_1\" background_position=\"left top\" background_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" border_color=\"\" border_style=\"solid\" spacing=\"yes\" background_image=\"\" background_repeat=\"no-repeat\" padding=\"\" margin_top=\"0px\" margin_bottom=\"0px\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_direction=\"left\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" center_content=\"no\" min_height=\"none\"][caption id=\"attachment_17758\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"980\"]<img class=\"size-large wp-image-17758\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-13-at-11.25.08-AM-980x401.png\" alt=\"Example of a well-organized Digital Dialogue season folder\" width=\"980\" height=\"401\" /> Example of a well-organized Digital Dialogue season folder[/caption]\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Another part of this project consisted of editing previous content to conform to current standards. Due to the variety of files that existed, both formats and duplicates, I decided to prioritize raw footage (or the highest quality derivative that I could discover) for archiving and the creation of new videos. Provided that usable media was accessible, videos currently on the MITH website are being updated to reflect proper MITH logos and branding, as well as title slates with appropriate attributions to speakers, dates and talk titles. There are also many years of Digital Dialogues recorded as audio, which are in the process of being exported to a standardized video format so that the majority of Digital Dialogues will be accessible to the user through one hosting service (Vimeo). At the end of the project, I will have created or recreated around 105 videos, streamlined and documented any changes to MITH’s audiovisual workflows, and ensured proper digital stewardship of an important collection of digital humanities scholarship. My second and final blog post in this series will highlight some of the more interesting content in this collection.</span>\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n&nbsp;[/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]",

This library is written in the <a href=\"http://www.scala-lang.org/\">Scala programming language</a> and currently serves primarily as a lightweight wrapper for <a href=\"http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/\">MALLET</a>. It pulls together bits of functionality and code that we at MITH found ourselves developing for various projects with a topic modeling component, including a graduate course project on the Gothic novel and science fiction, Lisa Rhody's <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/research/review-revise-requery/\">work on ekphrastic poetry</a>, <a href=\"http://www.literaturegeek.com\" target=\"_blank\">Amanda Visconti</a>'s work on <a href=\"http://digitalliterature.net/viewDHQ/\" target=\"_blank\">visualizing Digital Humanities Quarterly</a>, and the  <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/research/fla/\">Foreign Literatures in America</a> project.\n\nOne simple piece of functionality that we've found widely useful is a command-line tool that exports data from a model file generated by MALLET to a spreadsheet that can be opened in Excel or <a href=\"http://www.libreoffice.org/\" target=\"_blank\">LibreOffice</a>. While Excel is in many ways a less sophisticated data analysis platform than tools like R, it is widely used and has a relatively shallow learning curve. For example, this tool has allowed us to train a topic model and hand the results as a spreadsheet to a group of undergraduate students, who can then easily identify the documents in their corpus most strongly associated with a particular topic, or find the documents that are most similar (according to the topic model) to a particular text they are reading.\n\nThe project currently doesn't go out of its way to insulate users from the command line, but it is designed to be easy to install and use. It relies on the <a href=\"http://maven.apache.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Maven build tool</a> to manage dependencies, so you can run MALLET's topic modeling engine (with reasonable defaults) without manually installing MALLET on your machine, for example. If you're on a Mac with OS X, you already have Maven installed, and if you run Windows or Linux the installation process of installing Maven is <a href=\"http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html\" target=\"_blank\">fairly painless and straightforward</a>.\n\nIf you're curious about topic modeling and are willing to roll up your sleeves and open a terminal, we'd encourage you to click the link above and try out this software. This is very much a work in progress, so let us know about features you'd like to see—either in a comment here or by <a href=\"https://github.com/umd-mith/topic-modeling/issues\" target=\"_blank\">creating a new issue</a> in the GitHub repository—and we'll do our best to get them implemented. And watch this space—in the spring we'll be launching a sandbox environment that will allow users to run MALLET and other topic modeling tools without installing any software on their local machine.",

The team then discussed the relative merits of an editor that hides the source (e.g. TEI-ann) or one like Oxygen that allows the user to see what she is doing.  Split mostly down the middle, we decided to divide into two teams.  One would extend the TEI-ann plugin to handle the full TEI-lite schema, the other would build a light-weight XML editor (which would expose the full XML source).\n\nThe teams are now working hard, but could use additional coding help if anyone wants to join us.  You can email us at mith AT umd.edu or join us on IRC at irc.freenode.net in the #teieditor room.",

Instead of having to manually sift through each message, the parser identifies key information, logs it in a dictionary, and can spit it back out when called. At a practical level, using this method has saved me a considerable amount of “processing time,” so to speak. Early on, however, I noticed multiple “Nones” appearing in my results, which indicated that an attempt to access the message headers had failed. I didn’t think much of it at the time, given the size of these collections.<sup>1</sup> Just some static I could ignore in favor of the much more sizable noise. Then I started work on the cisgender network, and I discovered that static was actually noise as well. I just hadn’t been prepared to listen for it.\n\n\n\nFirst, here’s what a raw usenet post from the collection looks like (to maintain anonymity, I’ve removed to the name/email in the “From:” line):\n\n<blockquote>----\n\nFrom -8946248053963491671\n\nX-Google-Language: ENGLISH,ASCII-7-bit\n\nX-Google-Thread: 10857f,b3db99cd0296b805\n\nX-Google-Attributes: gid10857f,public\n\nFrom: Email-Address (Name)\n\nSubject: Re: New Member\n\nDate: 1997/11/17\n\nMessage-ID: &lt;3470d5d4.1323094@news.lineone.net&gt;#1/1\n\nX-Deja-AN: 290289518\n\nReferences: &lt;01bcf387$c1ae6e60$0202010a@hp-customer&gt; &lt;64q94t$aj4@mtinsc03.worldnet.att.net&gt;\n\nOrganization: British Telecom\n\nNewsgroups: alt.support.crossdressing\n\n\n\nHello April----------enjoy the ride!!-------------Joanne x\n\n----</blockquote>\n\nAs you can see, each post includes a header with a variety of associated metadata and then the text of the message itself. The collected Usenet postings, by and large, follow the conventions of email formatting at the time, with From, Subject, Date, and Message ID headers, along with a variety of Usenet specific or non-standard headers added by news clients or servers (designated by the “X-” prefix). Because these collections were scraped from the Google Groups format, every message header begins with “From” and the unique message ID assigned by Google, followed by a set of proprietary, non-standard headers.\n\n\n\nAs part of building my network, I collected the content of all messages indexed as part of the network in a .txt file. Some of these messages, however, began at seemingly random points in the body of a message, even though the original messages in the collection had all of the necessary information, including headers. Yet when I tried to find a cause, there were no immediately apparent similarities in the messages which came up, nor any less “visible” options like invisible characters.\n\n\n\nAs I found (with the excellent help of Ed Summers), these message were the empty “Nones.” As noted earlier, I’ve been relying on the pre-built Python parser to successfully identify the start of each message. The parser determines the start of a message using headers defined by <a href=\"https://www.irt.org/rfc/rfc2822.htm\">RFC (Request for Comments) 2822</a>, or searches for “a single envelope header, also known as the Unix-From header or the From_ header.” In the mailbox format, the envelope header functions as a separator to indicate the start of a new message. In practice, though, the parser flags all new lines that begin with “From ” as the start of a new message and searches for the defined headers. In most instances, however, developers follow the advice outlined in the documentation on the mbox format, <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4155\">RFC 4155</a>: “Many implementations are also known to escape message body lines that begin with the character sequence of \"From \", so as to prevent confusion with overly-liberal parsers that do not search for full separator lines.”\n\n\n\nThe Python parser, it turns out, is an overly liberal parser. Because it was matching any instance of newline + “From ”, it read all sentences beginning with “From ” as the start of a new message—which, of course, lacked any recognizable headers. When outputting the message content to my “collector” file, the “From” line was skipped and each message began on the next line down, resulting the apparent randomness of the message’s beginning.\n\n\n\nSolving this problem, however, was somewhat more complex. I had two options: write a module that adapts the existing parser for my purposes or create a module that made a duplicate of the mailbox edited to prevent inappropriate flagging. Given my current schedule, I opted for the latter approach. However, for both there was a combination of factors made this task particularly thorny.<sup>2</sup>\n\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">A) Because of overly-liberal parser design, the mailbox has (at least initially) to be read line by line.</p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">B) I didn’t want a solution that unnecessarily “cleans” the data by removing the proprietary Google headers. Also, removing the headers a) doesn’t change core problem with the parser and b) necessitates the creation of a replacement envelope header.</p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">C) The Google header being read as the envelope header doesn’t match the RFC standard for mailbox separator lines (IE: From foobar@gmaill.com Wed Jan 25 21:37:37 2017), so existing email-based solutions weren’t immediately helpful.</p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">D) Lastly, whatever I wrote had to be able to differentiate between Google’s proprietary header, whose content was consistent in format (“From ”, sometimes a -, and a series of digits), and sentences beginning with “From ”, which were entirely inconsistent.</p>\n\nMy current solution, while not technically elegant, uses this consistency to its advantage. Because the Google-specific message ID is always numerical, I know the seventh character (index location 6) will always be a number. In contrast, this combination occurs very rarely in the message text itself. Instead, all instances of “From ” that don’t have a digit at index 6 are changed to “xFrom ” in the new file. The module then does a pass of the new file, checking the end of “From ” lines for a digit. Any lines that don’t have a digit are printed in a separate log, so they can be manually checked and edited if necessary.\n\n\n\nAt a later point, I would like to sit down and write a Usenet-specific parser, adapted to account for this issue and Usenet-specific headers. After all, this process is by no means foolproof—as illustrated by the necessity of doing a manual check afterwards. Nevertheless, for me performing the manual check has served as a small, subtle reminder to “listen” to all of the information I received, not just that which seemed to sound “right.”\n\n\n\n[/fusion_text][fusion_separator style_type=\"single solid\" top_margin=\"\" bottom_margin=\"\" sep_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" icon=\"\" icon_circle=\"\" icon_circle_color=\"\" width=\"\" alignment=\"center\" class=\"\" id=\"\"/][fusion_text]<sup>\n\n1</sup>Part of this assumption was also based in the formatting of “spam” messages in the collection. In order to avoid being auto-cancelled (blocked from posting), contemporary mass-mailed Usenet spam often uses non-standard emails or other methods to avoid being flagged by cancel bots. I initially assumed their non-standard formatting was being misread by the parser, but this was not the case.\n\n\n\n<sup>2</sup>Some of these issues are, no doubt, <a href=\"http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000383.shtml#sustainability\">why institutional archives like the Smithsonian use MBOX as a stepping-stone before converting the files to XML</a>.[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]",

I hope that my talk furthers his vision of social justice and equity in some important ways.\"\r\n\r\nLionel Cantu was assistant professor of sociology at the University of California, Santa Cruz at the time of his unexpected death. He was 36. Established in 2003, the Cantu Memorial Colloquium honors one graduate student and faculty member pursuing studies related to his research. His co-edited anthology with Eithne Luibheid, <em>Queer Migrations: Sexuality, U.S. Citizenship, and Border Crossings</em> was posthumously published by the University of Minnesota Press in 2005.\r\n\r\nNieves is also traveling to Uganda, Rwanda, and South Africa in June as part of an ACC/IAC Faculty Fellowship he was awarded.  The program, \"Post-Conflict Reconciliation and Reconstruction in Africa,\" will provide an opportunity to explore and possibly establish additional collaborations with historic sites in Uganda and Rwanda.  He hopes to add two additional sites to his current project under the umbrella of a larger meta site on issues of national reconciliation.",

In the grand tradition of the Old Order Mennonites of the Pennsylvanian and Canadian prairies (well, except for that whole eschewing modern technologies thing), we're hosting a virtual barn-raising and building something as a community for the good of the community. There have been several attempts (at MITH and elsewhere) to build a web-based TEI editor, and some great prototypes have emerged, but none have quite produced a really usable tool.  We hope, in 5 days, to begin a process that will change that. On January 3rd we'll spend the day meeting with whomever is interested to design initial specifications for the tool. On the morning of January 4th, interested coders will divy up the tasks and head back home. We'll all get a good night's sleep, fire up our Skype accounts, and start a remote worksprint on Wednesday-Friday with the goal of a public launch at 4 p.m. Eastern on January 7th.\n\nOk, we know, it's crazy. It's only 2 weeks away. There's no time, and no money available to pay for travel. Besides, so many have tried before and none have succeeded. But what if this time...this time it was different? What if you had a chance at the all-surpassing glory of participating in one of the greatest DH events of the new year. A group from Canada has already signed up. You could be next. Just send us an email at mith AT umd dot edu to sign up. It's gonna be great!",

    "wp post content": "<em>This post was co-authored by members of the Born-Digital Working Group.</em>\n\nIn early September of 2012 the University of Maryland Libraries and the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) joined forces to launch its Born-Digital Working Group. As a vehicle for leveraging some rapidly emerging institutional strengths in processing and maintaining born-digital collections, as well as conducting research around the challenges associated with those activities, the group was a natural way to give those efforts some internal structure and coherence. It also formalized a relationship between a university research library, in particular its Special Collections department, and a working digital humanities center. We are excited for this collaboration, one in which we can each learn from the other, bringing different sets of skills to the table to begin tackling the issues of stewarding born digital materials.\n\nOne area where work has already begin is in processing the papers of Bill Bly, who joins Deena Larsen as an early hypertext and electronic literature pioneer whose manuscript materials and collections of computer hardware and software are housed at MITH. The Bly collection includes a complete run of titles from the innovative hypertext publisher Eastgate Systems (still in their original packaging), as well as his own personal collection of hypertext fiction and ephemera harvested in the wild, and important records associated with community events like the 1999 CyberMountain conference.  For MITH, the collection tantalizes us with questions related to our research agenda in textual scholarship and media archaeology. (Intriguingly, Bly is perhaps best-known for his ongoing fiction series <a href=\"http://www.wedescend.com/\">We Descend</a>, which features an archivist as its protagonist.)\n<img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_17M5s9Kz0S9-56etqSRkOZpBPj_8vslfWOMbJ-egMC7APvCivwLEg-Mpy-4LXVnY7G5_TFv-DDGEJIbCCoB-4Zq9DLnllGzTcEzy8n0o3O-XLl2aV44\" alt=\"\" width=\"407\" height=\"271\" />\n\nOne defining feature of the Bill Bly collection is the eclectic nature of the objects that it contains. In addition to the papers commonly found in a collection, the Bly collection also includes two laptops used by the author while writing We Descend; software manuals that range from the highly-specialized Hypercard hypertext authoring software to basic Mac OS user guides; vintage keyboards and mice; and loose floppy diskettes. Making appraisal decisions are key to archival work. What do we keep? What do we discard? These questions quickly arose in the Bly papers as well. The Born-Digital Working Group had a sustained discussion about what to do with the software manuals included in the Bly collection. Were they an important part of understanding the technological environment in which the author worked, and therefore essential to the collection? Or, because they are mass-produced books of no specific connection to Bly’s work, could they be moved into a reference library with a separation sheet indicating that they were originally contained in the collection? While we haven’t yet come to a definitive answer, it seems clear that similar conversations will become increasingly common in the archival community.\n\n<img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wSMVvtkah5mAUHAp8xlqvv1S1LPVom_vEqJZGNLp9Lh9E_FARrCzW4AzFvnH5mmbTb0kww2Uymb4cGCHZ2iXAn4DBRdxwv5tTjsbiKZbqxNOag8EBd_c\" alt=\"\" width=\"392\" height=\"260\" />\n\nGone are the days when an author’s papers are actually, well, papers. In addition to pens and typewriters, we now use keyboards, mice, even dictation software as the means by which we write. Will no author’s collection be complete without a functioning vintage system running the same version of Dragon Natural Speaking that the author used? Or, will practical constraints compel us to a different solution?\n\nFor Special Collections, the Bill Bly Papers allows staff to test-drive procedures for dealing with material of this type. As we started work on the papers last week our goal was to establish basic intellectual control over the collection, starting with the paper portion and moving to the electronic. We wanted to begin to understand where our accessioning procedures would be impacted by the existence of born digital material. As Special Collections is at the very beginning stages of dealing with born-digital material, working with the Bly papers allows us to begin conceptualizing how procedures and workflows for hybrid collections of papers and electronic materials might be different.\n\nThinking about all the steps involved in processing a hybrid collection can seem overwhelming. Luckily, projects already exist to guide us through this process and we are consulting both OCLC’s report “<a href=\"http://www.oclc.org/content/dam/research/publications/library/2012/2012-06.pdf\">You’ve Got to Walk Before You Can Run: First Steps for Managing Born-Digital Content on Physical Media</a>” and the AIMS <a href=\"http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/aims/whitepaper/\">white paper </a>on born digital collections. Looking at the guidance in these reports in concert with our very first baby steps on this project a number of question have arisen already:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Does the legal agreement with this donor adequately cover digital material? How will we need to modify special collections donor agreements to cover born-digital material?</li>\n\t<li>Our inventory consisted of recording of the number and type of disks. Clearly, this is not truly accessioning these materials. What tools are available that will allows to accession the files on those disks? Will we bother dealing with commercial software programs?</li>\n\t<li>Will we use forensic imaging or simply copy the files?</li>\n\t<li>Is the media important? Should we keep it, take photographs, or simply dispose of the media once the data is captured?</li>\n</ul>\nWhat we have already learned from this project is that we don’t have to know all the answers at this point and that we shouldn’t expect to. The collaboration between these two institutions allows us to experiment, to raise questions, and then seek the answers together. We recognize  a primary goal of this project is to more clearly define our capabilities and begin developing a born digital policy as the project develops. At this stage in the process, the questions truly do seem more important than the answers, which only adds to the value, to what we can learn by collaborating to examine the issues demonstrated within the collection of an early adopter e-literature author such as Bill Bly.",

    "wp post content": "<img class=\" wp-image-12828 alignleft\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/black-gotham-archive.jpg\" alt=\"Black Gotham Book\" width=\"234\" height=\"347\" />Tuesday, May 1, 12:30-1:45pm\n\n6137 McKeldin Library, Special Events\n\nCosponsored by the Departments of African-American Studies, American Studies, and English\n\n\n\n\"From Print to Digital: The Black Gotham Digital Archive\" by <strong>CARLA PETERSON</strong>\n\nCo-presenter: <strong>SETH DENBO</strong>\n\n\n\nI’ve spent my MITH fellowship year working on “The Black Gotham Digital Archive.” My goal is to link an interactive web site, smart phones, and the geographic spaces of Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn to create a deeper understanding of nineteenth-century black New York. The project is an extension of my book, <em>Black Gotham: A Family History of African Americans in Nineteenth-Century New York City </em>(Yale UP, 2011), and is motivated by my search for new media forms that will allow greater flexibility, interactivity, and potential for reaching a broader audience.\n\n\n\nI structured my book around two principal concepts. The first was chronology, in which I took family history as a starting point to construct a broader social and cultural history of New York City’s black elite from about 1805 to 1895. The second was social geography, in which I illustrated the myriad ways in which members of the black elite inhabited Gotham, emphasizing how, in contrast to the all too familiar Harlem model, nineteenth-century black New Yorkers lived throughout the entire city, in different wards and neighborhoods.\n\n\n\nMy digital archive is structured around the same conceptual principles, but it relies on a different form of storytelling, one which inverts the relationship between text and image. In my book, word was the primary vehicle for telling my story and image functioned as supporting illustration; in the digital archive, image is the primary vehicle and word supporting document. Throughout the year, I’ve been working with MITH staff member Seth Denbo to implement this storytelling principle. Using Omeka as a platform, we have created a series of exhibits based on images, maps with clickable icons, narrative and descriptive text with links to ancillary material (manuscript material, newspaper accounts, books, collections, etc). The result is a greater sense of simultaneity (different historical actors doing different things at same time), mobility (movement through the streets of New York), and audience interactivity.\n\n\n\nIn the next phase of my project, I encourage further interactivity in at least two ways. The first is the creation of smart phone walking tours that will enable visitors to my archive to download an app that uses real-time geo-location information to provide them with targeted content from it; they can visit the neighborhoods discussed in the archive, view the locations of places mentioned, see images in context, and read the information provided. The second is to create a feature that will allow viewers to add their own stories to “The Black Gotham Digital Archive” and thus enhance our knowledge base of the social and cultural history of black New Yorkers in the nineteenth century.\n\n\n\nThis presentation will be held in the Special Events Room of McKeldin Library.\n\n\n\n<strong>Carla L. Peterson</strong> is a professor in the <a href=\"http://www.english.umd.edu/\">Department of English</a> at the University of Maryland, and affiliate faculty of the departments of Women’s Studies, American Studies, and African-American Studies.

    "wp post content": "A MITH Digital Dialogue\r\r\nTuesday, April 3, 12:30-1:45\r\r\nMITH Conference Room, McKeldin Library B0135\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Visible Evidence of Invisible Learning\"\r\r\n\r\r\nby RANDY BASS (Georgetown University)\r\r\n\r\r\nFaculty and practitioners who work with digital pedagogies know, at least intuitively, that student learning is significantly transformed in new media environments. As all of higher education wades deeper into the learning paradigm, it is increasingly important to move our understanding of new media learning beyond generalizations about engagement, interaction, and collaboration. The Visible Knowledge Project was a six-year project engaging about 60 faculty from 21 institutions, in order to explore the impact of technology on learning, especially in the humanities. This presentation will give an overview of the broad findings from the project, and look specifically at one strand of that faculty-driven research: Digital stories/narrative. The scholarship of teaching and learning that was produced by the project focuses us in part on the expansion of our conceptions of \"expertise\" in student intellectual development, and the roles that new media pedagogies play in that expansion. An expanded conception of expertise might be critical to recognizing how digital pedagogies often produce forms and symptoms of learning that are elusive--if not invisible--in traditional assessments or frameworks for understanding student development. This presentation will open up some of the questions about what we recognize as learning, and especially the ways that new media pedagogies and literacies invite us to expand our recognition of learning.\r\r\n\r\r\nRANDY BASS is Assistant Provost for Teaching and Learning Initiatives at Georgetown University, and Executive Director of Georgetown's Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship (CNDLS), a campus-wide center supporting faculty work in new learning and research environments. He has been working with a number of pedagogy and technology projects since 1986, including serving as Director and Principal Investigator of the Visible Knowledge Project, a five-year scholarship of teaching and learning project involving 70 faculty on 21 university and college campuses. He is also a Consulting Scholar for the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancment of Teaching, where he served, in 1998-99, as a Pew Scholar and Carnegie Fellow. In 1999, he won the Educause Medal for outstanding achievement in technology and undergraduate education. Bass is Associate Professor of English and a member of the American Studies Committee at Georgetown University. He is the author of Border Texts: Cultural Readings for Contemporary Writers (Houghton Mifflin, 1998), and with Bret Eynon, co-editor of Intentional Media: The Crossroads Conversations on Teaching and Technology in the American Cultural History Classroom (double issue of Works &amp; Days). He is currently, also with Bret Eynon, co-editing a volume of essays and findings from the Visible Knowledge Project, entitled, The Difference that Inquiry Makes.\r\r\n\r\r\nComing up @MITH, April 10: Kate Murray (University Libraries), \"Developing Digital Curation Policies in a Local Context.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nView MITH's complete Spring Speakers Schedule here:\r\r\n\r\r\n<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100615151132/http://www.mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_spring_2007.pdf\">http://www.mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_spring_2007.pdf</a>\r\r\n\r\r\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-8927).",

The deployment is part of a longitudinal study to understand how electronic reading devices are used in an academic setting. One of the goals this semester is also to determine how the introduction of a second device--wirelessly linked to the first--affects the reading experience. In this Digital Dialogues talk, Chen will describe the devices being used by Kraus and her students, their design rationale, and some of the more unique aspects of the study being conducted.  Kraus will preview an upcoming assignment that has students reading a 20th-century avant-garde novel on the\ndual-display e-readers, a novel originally published in unbound sheaves that the reader is encouraged to assemble in any order. The presenters will conclude with some of the more surprising results gathered so far, at the\nhalfway point of this study.\n\nNicholas Chen is a doctoral candidate in the department of Computer Science at the University of Maryland and is affiliated with the Human Computer Interaction Lab (HCIL) at UMD. He is advised by Professor Francois Guimbretiere in the Cornell University Information Science Department. His research is on electronic reading devices, pen-based user interfaces, and interactions for supporting simultaneous use of multiple devices. Chen currently holds the Google Fellowship in Human Computer Interaction.\nPreviously, he performed the first-ever evaluation of a dual-display electronic reading device.\n\nKari Kraus is an assistant professor in the College of Information Studies and the Department of English at the University of Maryland.  Her research and teaching interests focus on new media and the digital humanities, textual scholarship and print culture, digital preservation, and game studies.  Kraus is a local Co-PI on a Library of Congress NDIIPP grant for preserving virtual worlds; a Co-PI on an IMLS Digital Humanities Internship grant; and, with Derek Hansen (iSchool), the Co-Principal Investigator of an NSF grant to study Alternate Reality Games in the service of education and design.\n\nComing up @MITH April 6th: Patrik Svenson (HUMlab, Umea.

The project is a partnership between MITH, The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), Stanford University, and the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). In the first phase (2008-2010) we focused on fairly practical matters: getting videogame data into a form that could be transferred to and stored within a digital repository, packaged with enough descriptive information that a user in the far future <em>might</em> be able to access it meaningfully. You can read the <a href=\"https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/handle/2142/17097\" target=\"_blank\">final report here</a>.\n\n\n\nIn the second phase (PVW2), we're focusing on what exactly accessing a videogame \"meaningfully\" entails. What features need to be preserved (and how faithfully) to maintain an authentic experience of gameplay? Within the cultural heritage community, those features essential to authenticity are called <em>significant properties</em>. The <a href=\"http://www.significantproperties.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">InSPECT project</a> says of significant properties:\n\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Significant properties are those aspects of the digital object which must be preserved over time in order for the digital object to remain accessible and meaningful. An institution with curatorial responsibility for digital objects cannot assert or demonstrate the continued authenticity of those objects over time, or across transformation processes, unless it can identify, measure, and declare the specific properties on which that authenticity depends. Nor can it undertake the preservation actions required to maintain access to those objects, unless it can characterize their current technical representations with sufficient detail.</em></p>\n\nWith some items, these properties are fairly self evident. Structure and content are essential to maintaining an authentic copy of an inter-office memo, but aesthetic details like font style and color (with rare exceptions) probably are not.  Knowing that we will never perfectly replicate my first experience playing Oregon Trail on a classroom Apple ][, looking at the significant properties raises many questions, few of them with anything approaching a definite answer, most of them with different answers depending who you ask.\n\n<ul>\n\n\t<li>How important is the hardware? Is a game fundamentally changed if it was originally played with a paddle, but is emulated using a joystick?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n\n\t<li>If the game was originally intended for a CRT display, is playing on an LCD or Plasma screen authentic?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n\n\t<li>How important is sound fidelity? Early games used sound very minimally, because they were limited to the harsh sounds of an internal PC-speaker. (Try playing the \"PC beep\" sound in your computer's sound options. Now imagine an entire soundtrack of PC beeps).</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n\n\t<li>How important is color fidelity? If the blood spatter in a first person shooter was originally PMS  186, do we lose something fundamental if it's emulated as PMS 185 (<a href=\"http://www.pantone.com/pages/pantone/index.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Pantone Matching System</a>)?</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nHow do we even begin to answer these questions?!  We're using a three step process:\n\n\n\nPlay through a case set of games and take note of features that jump out during and after play.  All project partners did a trial run at this analysis with <em><a href=\"http://www.mobygames.com/game/typing-of-the-dead\" target=\"_blank\">Typing of the Dead</a>.</em> At MITH, we've been tasked to examine titles from the <em><a href=\"http://www.mobygames.com/game-group/harpoon-series\" target=\"_blank\">Harpoon</a></em>, <em><a href=\"http://www.mobygames.com/game-group/oregon-trail-series\" target=\"_blank\">Oregon Trail</a></em>, and <em><a href=\"http://www.mobygames.com/game-group/mario-licensees\" target=\"_blank\">Super Mario Bros.</a></em> franchises. \"Taking note\" ranged from spontaneous expressions caught on video as we played, hand-written notes, and post-play captioning of video screen-capture. The notes were then compiled into a list of potential features, which we analyzed both narratively:\n\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">\"<em>TotD has intratextonic dynamics. While target phrases (the sequences typed to fire at an enemy) follow a pattern, they may change based on the difficulty setting, special items found with the game, or a random algorithm choosing from a set list of options. The first-person perspective is personal. Because the game is on rails with a linear storyline, game action is determinant and predictable, with only limited modification based on difficulty setting, special items, and in-game actions such as rescuing a non-combatant NPC.  Standard enemy NPCs move in the same patterns and will have standard phrase lengths and error forgiveness based on difficulty setting and game level. Boss characters are slightly less predictable in that they may be less tolerant of errors, errors might have consequences beyond missing a shot, and battle sequences are longer with some variety to the type and timing of attacks directed at the player. The on rails nature of the game also makes it transient; the player character will continue to move through the game level and be attacked by NPCs regardless of her input into the game.  Access is controlled and conditional, with the player required to complete levels linearly, within a certain amount of time/with a certain amount of life points before accessing new content, both playable and not.</em>\" (Following the pattern set out by Lars Konzack in his <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Konzack_GameCriticism_2002.pdf\">2002 CDGC conference paper</a>).</p>\n\nAnd ontologically:[/fusion_text][fusion_imageframe lightbox=\"yes\" lightbox_image=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/TotDOntology.png\" style_type=\"none\" hover_type=\"none\" bordercolor=\"\" bordersize=\"0px\" borderradius=\"0\" stylecolor=\"\" align=\"center\" link=\"\" linktarget=\"_self\" animation_type=\"0\" animation_direction=\"down\" animation_speed=\"0.1\" animation_offset=\"\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" class=\"\" id=\"\"] <img alt=\"TotDOntology\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/TotDOntology-980x277.png\" />[/fusion_imageframe][fusion_separator style_type=\"none\" top_margin=\"10\" bottom_margin=\"10\" sep_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" icon=\"\" icon_circle=\"\" icon_circle_color=\"\" width=\"\" alignment=\"center\" class=\"\" id=\"\"/][fusion_text]The ontology used above combined Alexander Galloway's work in \"Game Action, Four Moments\" (a chapter in a book he edited titled <em>Gaming: Essays on Algorithmic Culture</em>) and an in-house list of mechanics developed based on our own experiences playing games. Later attempts also incorporated the work done by the <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20130823171057/http://www.gameontology.com:80/index.php/Main_Page\" target=\"_blank\">Game Ontology Project</a>.\n\n\n\nKnowing our bias as both players and researchers, the second step has been to interview the actual developers of the games as possible.  The developers, however, have their own biases: Both Larry Bond, original creator of <em>Harpoon</em> and Don Rawsitch of <em>Oregon Trail</em> firmly believe that the algorithms and data lying underneath their games are the <em>only</em> features with any significance. While it's true that in the future a game could be recreated by overlaying a new interface over the back-end data and algorithms, it's doubtful that many of the original game players would call such a recreation \"authentic.\"\n\n\n\nThis is where the third phase of our research will take over.  We will be running a series of double-blind experiments in which subjects will play both an original and emulated version of games in our case set, using the original controller. Subjects will be encouraged to verbalize any differences they note and will be given an exit interview to be developed from our experiences and interviews in the initial stages of the project.\n\n\n\nTaken together, we hope the data we gather will help us to generate a best practices guide—or at least starting point—for cultural heritage professionals who may be faced with preserving highly interactive digital objects unlike any other digital or physical artifact in their collections.[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]",

One fortunate result is that more DH work has been opened up to scholarly critique by a considerably broader humanities audience. However, much of this work — often the most innovative —­ cannot be fully evaluated through the traditional critical lenses of the humanities.\n\n\n\nThis talk argues that the DH community neither has established a sufficient rubric for critiquing its work, nor has been critical enough of its own projects. It argues, too, that DH work does require special consideration that is not part of typical humanities criticism, and without it, calls its own value into question. So what constitutes a scholarly DH project? How many critical rubrics might be needed to accommodate the variety of valuable projects? Can the diversifying DH community ever agree on these? This talk grapples with a critical theory for the digital humanities with hopes of fostering a much longer conversation about how humanities scholars can appreciate and fruitfully critique the variety of digital work that is reshaping the humanities.\n\n\n\nDr. Gibb's talk will be held in the MITH Conference Room, in the basement of McKeldin Library.\n\n\n\nFred Gibbs is an assistant professor of history at George Mason University and Director of Digital Scholarship at the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media. His research interests lie at the intersection of natural philosophy and medicine in the late medieval and early modern periods. His current research explores medical literature on poison c.1200-1600, especially how physicians debated its ontological existence and its role in disease. At RR-CHNM, he develops and executes both large and small digital humanities projects sponsored by a variety of funding agencies, including the NEH, NSF, Sloan, and Mellon Foundations. Most of these grapple with the theoretical and practical challenges of using large datasets for historical research.

Topic models, which automatically discover the themes which permeate a corpus, are a popular tool for discovering what's being discussed. However, topic models aren't perfect; errors hamper adoption of the model, performance in downstream computational tasks, and human understanding of the data. However, humans can easily diagnose and fix these errors. We present a statistically sound model to incorporate hints and suggestions from humans to iteratively refine topic models to better model large datasets.\n\n\n\nWe also examine how topic models can be used to understand topic control in debates and discussions. We demonstrate a technique that can identify when speakers are \"controlling\" the topic of a conversation, which can identify events such as when participants in a debate don't answer a question, when pundits steer a conversation toward talking points, or when a moderator exerts her influence on a discourse.\n\n\n\nThis talk will be held in the MITH Conference Room, in the basement of McKeldin Library.\n\n\n\nJordan Boyd-Graber is an assistant professor in Maryland's iSchool and UMIACS, and a member of the Cloud Computing Center and the Computational Linguistics and Information Processing (CLIP) Lab. His research applies statistical models to natural language problems in ways that interact with humans, learn from humans, or help researchers understand humans. Jordan is an expert in the application of topic models, completely automatic tools that can discover structure and meaning in large, multilingual datasets. He is a contributor to the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), a popular tool used in natural language education research. Jordan received his PhD from Princeton University in 2010, advised by Dave Blei, and has bachelors degrees in history and computer science from the California Institute of Technology. He received a best student paper honorable mention at NIPS 2009 and a Computing Innovation Fellowship (declined).

Mislaid and then forgotten from 1818 to 1976, this notebook that Percy Bysshe Shelley entrusted to Byron’s friend Scrope Davies was famously discovered in a trunk in the vaults of Barclay Bank at 1, Pall Mall East in London. It is currently held on loan at the British Library. The notebook contains two previously unknown sonnets by Shelley (\"Upon the wandering winds” and “To Laughter”) and alternative versions of “Hymn to Intellectual Beauty” and “Mont Blanc” (Scene—Pont Pellisier in the vale of Servox). Digital images of these poems with full transcriptions can be accessed independently or in the order of the notebook as a whole, and <a href=\"http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/contents/bl_loan_ms_70_08/\">may be found here</a>.\n\n\n\nSecond, we are very pleased to announce the award of a grant from Queen Mary University of London for digitizing the manuscripts of William Godwin’s two greatest works, <em>An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice</em> and <em>Caleb Williams</em>, held at the Victoria and Albert Museum<em>.</em> Overseen by renowned Godwin scholar Pamela Clemit, the project is a collaboration among QMUL, the V&amp;A, and the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH). We expect to make these manuscripts available on the Shelley-Godwin Archive by the end of September 2017. <a href=\"http://www.qmul.ac.uk/media/news/items/hss/194107.html\">More details about this project can be found here</a>.",

    "wp post content": "<p style=\"text-align: left\">Why do residents in the Italian neighborhood of Philadelphia pronounce words like “home” and “hoagie” in a Scottish dialect? Questions such as these have long drawn the curiosity of linguistics and language scholars. Up until now, audio recordings served as the primary source material for those studying accent and dialect history. Now, thanks to <a href=\"http://tdps.umd.edu/faculty/Leigh-Wilson-Smiley\" target=\"_blank\">Leigh Wilson Smiley</a>, Head of the MFA in Performance in the School of Theatre, Dance, and Performance Studies at the University of Maryland, and MITH Resident Fellow, her launch of the <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/vada/\" target=\"_blank\">Visual Accent and Dialect Archive</a> (VADA) allows viewers to closely monitor facial movements of speakers while listening to English spoken in a variety of accents and dialects.</p>\nVADA is a crowd-sourced YouTube video archive of English-language accents and dialects gathered from around the globe, providing visual information on language sound pronunciation for the theater community. Users are able to browse dialects from a selection of recorded interviews from “dialect donors”, who read a designated passage in English, or speak in their own words, in a variety of accents and dialects.\n\n<img class=\"alignleft\" title=\"vada_launch_logo\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/vada_launch_logo.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"54\" />\n\n<img class=\"alignleft\" title=\"VADA_Launch\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/vada_launch.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"198\" />\n\nThese videos are useful, Leigh explains, when working with an actor who uses their own facial muscles differently, and is learning an accent for a role. Observing the facial movement while hearing the words aloud assists the acquisition process. Leigh hopes VADA will serve as the central video source of people speaking English in different dialects for teachers and linguists, as well as for dialect and voice coaches working in professional theater.\n\nThe Archive is currently in Phase 1 and <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/vada/?q=node/238\" target=\"_blank\">welcomes</a> user-contributed videos of English-language accents and dialects from around the globe that have been uploaded to YouTube and use the project’s tag. The project currently contains videos from several geographic regions within Asia, Europe, North America and South/Central America, and seeks to add content from the continents of Africa and Oceania. Contributors may create up to three different video recordings, each of which demonstrates a different aspect of one’s accent or dialect. Linguists and language scholars are also invited to join the team as a contributor, by adding linguistic information to the video content.\n\nThe Italian neighborhood dialect in Philadelphia is Scottish because the shipbuilders who originally landed there were Scotsmen. The Italians adopted certain words in the Scottish dialect, thus creating the multi-dialectic fabric of the city as it stands today. The videos on VADA tell similar stories: listeners learn of a family’s dialectic history from Cary, Illinois, and the typical lifestyle in San Miguel, El Salvador. Dive into VADA, and discover not only dialects from far East to West, but also hear anecdotes of linguistic history that illuminate the estimated 6,700 languages and 39,000 dialects across the globe today.",

Understanding what the videogame industry itself is doing with the concept art, tools, and other records they create is an important step to ensure that these increasingly important artifacts are preserved for future generations. In this talk Donahue will discuss findings from her preliminary survey of videogame industry (and player community) preservation and records management practices.\n\n\n\nRACHEL DONAHUE is a doctoral student at the University of Maryland's iSchool, researching the preservation of complex, interactive digital objects. She received a BA in English and Illustration from Juniata College in 2004, and an MLS with a specialization in archival science from UMD in 2009. Rachel is a Research Assistant at the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities, currently supporting the Preserving Virtual Worlds and Computer Forensics and Born-Digital Content in Cultural Heritage Collections projects. Additionally, she supports the research and communications activities of the National Archives and Records Administration's Center for Advanced Systems and Technology.\n\n\n\nComing up @MITH 9/29, Zita Nunes (English and Comparative Literature), \"The Harlem Renaissance in Second Life\"\n\n\n\nNote: there will be no talk next week so as to avoid conflict with the university town hall.\n\n\n\nView MITH's complete Fall Speakers Schedule here:\n\n\n\n<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100608230933/http://www.mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_fall_2009.pdf\">http://www.mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_fall_2009.pdf</a>\n\n\n\nAll talks free and open to the public!\n\n\n\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-8927).",

    "wp post content": "Since my last post, I have been working on a grant application. This has afforded the opportunity of some stock taking. I’ve also had some very helpful conversations with scholars in the field: Juan Garcés and Matt Munson in Hebrew Biblical Studies, Tim Finney in New Testament and Desmond Schmidt in textual computing and classics.\n\n\n\n1. <em>Collation</em>. Based on very simple normalization and tokenization and a few samples, CollateX will remain error prone, unless the algorithm changes significantly. Examples: (1) In a Mishnah section with repeated words, slight differences in spelling resulted in pushing a whole clause off to the second match. (2) In another passage, CollateX failed to diagnose a missing clause in the text and aligned non matching tokens. My estimate is that currently the error rate is above 10% (for one passage it was about 15%). Better normalization will improve this result. This raises the question of whether the normalization (or, which may amount to the same thing, having CollateX ignore certain characters in comparison) can be carried out automatically, and what this would look like, or whether, as Desmond Schmidt assures me, the whole enterprise is wrongheaded.\n\n\n\n2. <em>Statistical measures,</em> now done by hand, but ideally automated. I have now invested in a license for SPSS. This, and my old friend Excel have allowed me to run some preliminary analyses. First: run collations on every Mishnah section in my sample chapter using a few representative witnesses. Transfer the output to Excel; manually fix the alignment (remember, high error rate). Then start flagging variations. I have opted for a method that is akin to what Schmidt and Tim Finney have used: effectively to create a master document with all possible readings, and use a binary encoding (1, 0) for each witness for whether the reading appears in a given witness. Use SPSS to generate a distance matrix, multi-dimensional scaling (MDS), and clustering. I have also experimented with sites providing a graphic interface to Bioinformatic software (FastME and Phylip) to produce phylogenetic trees.\n\n\n\nThe results were interesting enough that I wanted to see the results with more careful identification of variance (I’m doing these by hand, after all) and more witnesses. I used the sections with the fullest representation among witnesses (Chapter 2, Mishnah 1-2), choosing a total of 10 witnesses. The results I got were consistent with the larger text sample and fewer witnesses, but neither represented the accepted wisdom on the relationship between manuscripts. I therefore divided the cases between no-variation, substantive (different word, different gender, change in grammatical form), and orthographic (initial waw, matres lectiones, spacing between preposition and word). As an example, the Greek word <em>emporia</em> generated no fewer than six variant spellings, but all represented a recognizable version of the word.\n\n\n\nNow, there were some interesting results: the manuscripts thought to be of the “Palestinian type” clustered closely on substantive differences, considerably less so (and differently) on orthographic differences.\n\n\n\n[fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=\"yes\" overflow=\"visible\"][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=\"1_1\" background_position=\"left top\" background_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" border_color=\"\" border_style=\"solid\" spacing=\"yes\" background_image=\"\" background_repeat=\"no-repeat\" padding=\"\" margin_top=\"0px\" margin_bottom=\"0px\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_direction=\"left\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" center_content=\"no\" min_height=\"none\"][caption id=\"attachment_11146\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"375\"]<a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/OutputSubst1.jpg\" rel=\"ilightbox[gallery1]\"><img class=\"wp-image-11146\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/OutputSubst1.jpg\" alt=\"MDS for Substantive Differences, 10 Witnesses\" width=\"375\" height=\"300\" /></a> MDS for Substantive Differences, 10 Witnesses[/caption]&nbsp;\n\n\n\n[/fusion_builder_column][fusion_builder_column type=\"1_1\" background_position=\"left top\" background_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" border_color=\"\" border_style=\"solid\" spacing=\"yes\" background_image=\"\" background_repeat=\"no-repeat\" padding=\"\" margin_top=\"0px\" margin_bottom=\"0px\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_direction=\"left\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" center_content=\"no\" min_height=\"none\"][caption id=\"attachment_11148\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"375\"]<a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/OutputOrth13.jpg\" rel=\"ilightbox[gallery1]\"><img class=\"wp-image-11148\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/OutputOrth13.jpg\" alt=\"MDS for Orthographic Differences, 10 Witnesses\" width=\"375\" height=\"300\" /></a> MDS for Orthographic Differences, 10 Witnesses[/caption]&nbsp;\n\n\n\n[/fusion_builder_column][fusion_builder_column type=\"1_1\" background_position=\"left top\" background_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" border_color=\"\" border_style=\"solid\" spacing=\"yes\" background_image=\"\" background_repeat=\"no-repeat\" padding=\"\" margin_top=\"0px\" margin_bottom=\"0px\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_direction=\"left\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" center_content=\"no\" min_height=\"none\"][caption id=\"attachment_11149\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"232\"]<a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SusbtDistanceforPhylogRootedTree.jpg\" rel=\"ilightbox[gallery1]\"><img class=\"wp-image-11149\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SusbtDistanceforPhylogRootedTree.jpg\" alt=\"Rooted Tree (Phylip) for Substantive Differences, 10 Witnesses\" width=\"232\" height=\"300\" /></a> Rooted Tree (Phylip) for Substantive Differences, 10 Witnesses[/caption]The lesson: Orthographic and substantive variations do not coincide, probably due to scribal decision-making (and inconsistency). Substantive differences  seem to be better for groupings of text families. (This may be easier to identify automatically as well: normalizing orthography to improve collation erases orthographic difference (by definition), while retaining non-orthographic difference). But lingusitic and orthographic differences are of research significance too.  We may need a way for the user to flag readings to be compared.\n\n\n\n<em>Hayim Lapin is Robert H.

Harris</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Re: Appointment of Professor Neil Fraistat as Director of MITH</strong>\r\n\r\nJune 7, 2006\r\n\r\nI am happy to announce the appointment of Professor Neil Fraistat as Director of the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) beginning July 1, 2006. Neil is a Professor in the Department of English specializing in the Romantic era, textual scholarship, and digital studies. A recipient of the Distinguished Scholar Award from the Keats-Shelley Association and the Fredson Bowers Memorial Prize from the Society for Textual Scholarship, Neil is well known internationally for his scholarly editions of Percy Bysshe Shelley's poetry and for his work as co-founder and co-general editor of Romantic Circles , an award-winning scholarly website, now celebrating its tenth anniversary, that is published by the University of Maryland and devoted to the study of Romantic-period literature and culture.\r\n\r\nBeyond his work on Romantic Circles, Neil has been an active and highly visible presence in the field of Digital Humanities, creating electronic resources, publishing on such topics as electronic editing, MOOs, and computer gaming; giving talks and running numerous sessions at major conferences; and sitting on the advisory board of several major electronic projects and journals, including Literary and Linguistic Computing, the premier journal in the field. He has just begun a second five-year term on the Executive Council of the Association for Computers and the Humanities, the field's key professional organization. Neil has also served on an impressively large number of committees at every level within the university. He has been associated with the Dean's Task Force on New Technologies and the Humanities (1993), with ARHU's Committee on New Technologies, 1994-1996, and 2002-2004 (as Chair), and with MITH as both Chair of its Internal Advisory Board (1999-2005) and as Acting Director this past year.\r\n\r\nSince its founding in 1999 through a major Challenge Grant from the NEH and under the directorship of Martha Nell Smith, MITH has become one of the most dynamic and exciting units on campus, as well as one of the most renowned institutes of its kind in the world. I fully share the Search Committee's confidence in Neil's ability to build successfully upon MITH's great strengths in leading it to a yet higher level of excellence. The coming year provides an auspicious start: MITH will become the new headquarters of the Electronic Literature Organization, the premier professional organization for scholars and authors of born digital literature; it will add as Resident Fellows Merle Collins and Angel David Nieves, both working on fascinating multimedia archives involving African culture and history; and it will have as its new Networked Fellow the acclaimed hypertext fiction writer and conceptual artist, Shelley Jackson, who will be working on <em>Skin: A Mortal Work of Art</em>.\r\n\r\nMy thanks to the Search Committee ably chaired by Juan Uriagereka and composed of Ralph Bauer, Catherine Zabriskie, Ellen Borkowski, Allen Stairs, Roberta Lavine and Patricia Cossard.",

    "wp post content": "A MITH Digital Dialogue\n\nTuesday, April 7, 12:30-1:45\n\nMITH Conference Room, McKeldin Library B0135\n\n\n\n &quot;How to Play XML: Markup Technologies as Nomic Game&quot;\n\nby WENDELL PIEZ\n\n\n\nWhat is a \"game\"? A definition is famously difficult. Wittgenstein, for example, after having described language as a game in his Philosophical Investigations, goes on to problematize the question of what a game is, using the word (\"Spiel\" in German) as a vivid example of the contingency and provisional nature of the supposedly clear concepts communicated by language. Game Theory, a branch of mathematics, solves this question by avoiding it, providing its own definition of \"game,\" which only partially fits many or most games as we know them. And talking about games becomes really interesting when we reflect, as is inescapable since Peter Suber coined the term \"nomic game\" in 1982, that part of the action of many games, and indeed the essence of some, is in the process, play or competition of providing the game itself with its rules and hence its definition. Originally developed in reference to legislative systems as an illustration of \"a game of self-amendment,\" Suber's rule set for the game \"Nomic\" quickly took on a life of its own and spawned a thought industry related to economics, sociology and anthropology, life sciences, psychology and politics.\n\n\n\nMarkup technologies such as HTML, XML and everything that go with them, from schemas to processing languages to public specifications and standards, have many game-like aspects. As in many games, much of the activity of markup technologies is devoted to rules enforcement; it also, in nomic fashion, extends to breaking received rules and making new ones. An engagement with markup technologies, or with any media production or software application design that relies on them, demands tactics and strategy, presenting us with problems and tradeoffs enmeshed in complexities both on and off the board, and challenging us to decide not only how we play, but what game we wish to be playing. Not only that, but the deeper we go, the more nomic it gets. As we ponder what we are doing with markup technologies and how they are changing what else we do -- as scholars, teachers, publishers and creative producers -- it is well if we reflect on who is making the rules, how, for whose benefit, and whether, to what extent and how we might aspire to be doing this ourselves.\n\n\n\nWENDELL PIEZ was educated at the American School in Japan, Yale College (BA Classics, 1984) and Rutgers University (PhD English, 1991). Since 1994 he has worked with markup technologies, beginning with TEI and EAD SGML at the Center for Electronic Text in the Humanities at Rutgers and Princeton, and continuing with many varieties of document- and publishing-oriented XML since 1997. Since 1998 he has worked as a consultant at Mulberry Technologies, Inc., a leading developer of XML-based publishing solutions known for its work with (among many others) the Library of Congress and NLM/NCBI, the publishers of the Pubmed Central repository at the National Institutes of Health. He has taught numerous courses on XML, XSLT and related technologies to audiences in the public, private and academic sectors, and presented papers at industry and academic conferences on both practical and theoretical topics related to markup languages and their application. A member of the Association for Computers and the Humanities, since 2007 he has served as General Editor of Digital Humanities Quarterly.\n\n\n\nComing up @MITH 4/14: Andrew Stauffer (University of Virginia), \"From Electronic Editions to Digital Scholarship: Using What We've Made\"\n\n\n\nView MITH's complete Digital Dialogues schedule here:\n\n\n\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20100615144914/http://www.mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_spring_2009.pdf\n\n\n\nAll talks free and open to the public!\n\n\n\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-8927).",

EMA originates from the idea that music notation, like text, can be “addressed” in new ways in a digital environment, allowing scholars to identify and name structures of various kinds. However, how can one virtually “circle” a section of music notation? and how can a machine interpret this “circling” to retrieve music notation? To research these questions, we are teaming up with the <a title=\"Du Chemin: Lost Voices Project Web Site\" href=\"http://duchemin.haverford.edu/\">Du Chemin: Lost Voices</a> project, which is reconstructing songs from 16th c. France.\n\nWe will work on analytical music annotations already produced by students and scholars as part of the Du Chemin project and re-model them as Linked Open Data nanopublications. In the sciences, nanopublication is providing the research community with ways of managing attribution and documenting quality of even small contributions. The nanopublication model facilitates accurate citation and promotes massively collaborative scholarship. We seek to extend these benefits to humanities scholarship. To support and publish nanopublications of music annotations we will develop a prototype application able to interpret a search query and return a meaningful selection of music notation encoded according to the <a title=\"Music Encoding Initiative Web Site\" href=\"http://music-encoding.org/home\">Music Encoding Initiative</a> format.\n\nThe University of Maryland’s <a title=\"Center for the History of the New America\" href=\"http://www.newamerica.umd.edu/\">Center for the History of the New America</a> (CHNA) has partnered with MITH to develop the <a title=\"Transforming The Afro-Caribbean World\" href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/research/transforming-the-afro-caribbean-world/\">Transforming the Afro-Caribbean World (TAW)</a> project. Co-led by Julie Greene (Department of History and co-Director, CHNA) and MITH Assistant Director <a title=\"Jennifer Guiliano\" href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/people/person/jennifer-guiliano/\">Jennifer Guiliano</a>, TAW was awarded $28,961 to bring together scholars of the Panama Canal, Afro-Caribbean history, and experts in the digital humanities, data modeling, and visualization for a two-day planning workshop that will discuss a large-scale effort to explore Afro-Caribbean labor, migration, and the Panama Canal.\n\nThe U.S. project to construct the Panama Canal exerted a huge impact on the Americas, generating a tidal flow of migration from dozens of nations to the Panama Canal Zone in the early 20th century—and then beyond it to sites across the hemisphere, permanently altering the geography, economy, politics, and cultures of the Western Hemisphere. The TAW workshop has several aims: 1) digitization of a subset of the proposed records to evaluate potential costs and preservation issues; 2) exploration of structured data tools to reveal new insights about these records; 3) the creation of annotated bibliographies for use by teachers and the public as they begin to explore the centennial anniversary of the opening of the canal; and 4) identification of other archives and repositories to be included in a larger project. Ultimately this start-up grant will produce a work plan and report outlining a potential large-scale collaboration to map and explore the movement of Afro-Caribbean laborers between 1903 and 1920.\n\nFor more information please contact Raffaele Viglianti (EMA project) or Jennifer Guiliano (TAW project).",

Peterson will travel to the New York Society Library on May 2nd to claim her award and celebrate the other two winners.\n\nPart detective tale, part social and cultural narrative, <em>Black Gotham</em> is Carla Peterson’s riveting account of her quest to reconstruct the lives of her nineteenth-century ancestors. As she shares their stories and those of their friends, neighbors, and business associates, she brings to the forefront the rarely acknowledged achievements of nineteenth-century African Americans and a vital yet forgotten part of American history and culture.\n\n“The New York Society Library’s New York City Book Awards, established in 1996, honor books of literary quality or historical importance that, in the opinion of the selection committee, evoke the spirit or enhance appreciation of New York City. It is not necessary that the city be the major subject of the book, but it must play an essential, invigorating role beyond that of the setting.” The New York Society Library, the oldest in the city, was founded in 1754 by the New York Society.

Faculty recipients of the Vambery fellowship are selected on the basis of demonstrated work in European and American comparative literary studies in print, in film, or in other newly discovered technological forms. Gaycken is an Associate Professor in the English Department and a core faculty member of the Comparative Literature Program and the Film Program. He teaches courses on silent-era cinema history, the history of popular science, and the links between scientific and experimental cinema. He has published on the discovery of the ophthalmoscope, the flourishing of the popular science film in France at the turn of the 1910s, the figure of the supercriminal in Louis Feuillade's serial films, and the surrealist fascination with popular scientific images. His book </span><a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/devices-of-curiosity-9780199860685?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Devices of Curiosity: Early Cinema and Popular Science</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, appeared with Oxford University Press in the spring of 2015.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">During his fellowship year, Oliver will work on his project, ���‘The Living Book of Knowledge’: Visions of the Moving-Image Encyclopedia,” which traces the history of attempts to create an encyclopedic archive of recorded movement, from the late nineteenth century to the present. Related to the attempts to create these repositories is the matter of their consistent failure, since there has never been a robustly functional moving-image equivalent to the print encyclopedia. An overarching question will be whether the digital age promises a realization of the long-held dream of a moving-image encyclopedia, especially since the allure of an all-encompassing collection of knowledge is as powerful as ever thanks to networked computing systems underlying contemporary attempts to create a storehouse of total knowledge, as in Google’s pledge to archive “all human knowledge” via its recently unveiled “Knowledge Vault.”</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As a complement to his research, Oliver will consult with MITH staff to develop design documentation about and technical requirements for how aspects of prior encyclopedic film projects could live again via digital tools or platforms. In particular, this research will focus on the Encyclopedia Cinematographica collections of both film and textual components at the Internet Archive and the Human Studies Film Archive, as well as currently extant projects with a similar ambition, in particular the Encyclopedia of Life.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Please join us in welcoming Oliver to our team!</span>",

At the center of this nexus of users is the book itself, a virtual artifact that differs from its physical counterpart by being comprised of bits, not atoms; of textures, animated scripts, and geometric primitives rather than paper, ink, cloth, and thread. In this talk I will examine the infrastructure that supports this in-world bibliographic culture: specifically, the technologies used to create and read SL books; the social networks designed to promote and popularize them; the information services to collect, access, curate, and catalogue them; and the legal and economic systems developed to commodify them.  I will look at how the Second Life platform conditions our ideas of \"bookness\" by presenting us with interfaces for reading that borrow incongruously from print and manuscript traditions, first-person shooter games, and even military aviation. And I will suggest that the mixed economy of Real Life and Second Life makes it necessary to understand these immersive books as compound objects that exist within a system of relationships that include both in-world and out-world content, thereby complicating efforts to study, link, document, and preserve them. The talk will also include a demonstration of books I have made in SL and discuss future projects.\r\n\r\nKARI KRAUS's research and teaching interests focus on new media and the digital humanities, textual scholarship and print culture, digital preservation, and intellectual property.

    "wp post content": "My friend Sarah Wasserman, who is finishing up a brilliant dissertation on the idea and instances of ephemerality in 20th century American literature, recently sent me a couple of online columns written by Stanley Fish a few months back on the subject on the subject of blogs and the digital humanities.\n\nEphemerality has something to do with why Sarah sent these columns to me, but let me keep the precise reason on hold for a moment so that I can get on the table the three basic claims Fish makes about the digital humanities. These have made me reflect on my experiences this past year with the Foreign Literatures in America project, as well as my more general introduction to the ideas and culture of the digital humanities that have come through the consistently and remarkably stimulating intellectual environment, personnel, and speakers I’ve encountered at MITH.\n\nThe first argument that Fish makes is that, entwined with its own sense of excitement, there is a “religious” quality to the digital humanities—one that digital practitioners themselves might be reluctant to admit, but that manifests itself in a consistent self-descriptive discourse of revelation: one in which solitary authors and critics, finite texts, and definitive and authoritative understandings are radically displaced by digital horizons of the intellectually infinite and indefinite as well as the socially collective and cooperative.\n\nFish likes Milton, and so it is in the Miltonian image of the “all in all” that Fish describes this “theological” digital self-conception that “promises to liberate us from the confines of the linear, temporal medium in the context of which knowledge is discrete, partial and situated... and deliver us into a spatial universe where knowledge is everywhere available in a full and immediate presence to which everyone has access as a node or relay in the meaning-producing system.”\n\nI like Emerson, and so, when Fish describes a digital vision in which “[fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=\"yes\" overflow=\"visible\"][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=\"1_1\" background_position=\"left top\" background_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" border_color=\"\" border_style=\"solid\" spacing=\"yes\" background_image=\"\" background_repeat=\"no-repeat\" padding=\"\" margin_top=\"0px\" margin_bottom=\"0px\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_direction=\"left\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" center_content=\"no\" min_height=\"none\"][m]eaning [is] everywhere and nowhere, produced not by anyone but by everyone in concert, meaning not waiting for us at the end of a linear chain of authored thought in the form of a sentence or an essay or a book, but immediately and multiply present in a cornucopia of ever-expanding significances,” I know I’ve heard this revelation of infinitely concentric circles, boundless concert and union, and infinite, borderless correspondences before.\n\nAnd I think Fish is right to suggest that this theological (and very American, if you ask me, as an Americanist) narrativity does tend to inform digital humanist self-presentation to some degree that is worth thinking about.\n\nFor Fish, this “expansive” inclination in the digital humanities runs the risk of denying the finite, linear, and mortal conditions through which, much of the time at least, individuals actually think and certain forms of knowledge can only become generated. Here I think Fish has a valid point: digital humanists seem to me frequently more comfortable operating in iconoclastic mode, i.e., liberating humanists from prior dogmas such as traditional conceptions of the library, traditional models, valuations, and understandings of textuality, and the traditional divorce between humanistic and scientific/empiricist methods (all subjects I’ve heard several talks on this year, and good ones), than they are at convincingly explaining what can and should be done with the New Freedom.\n\nAs with Emerson, there is a kind of voracious ambiguity by which the digital humanities sometimes rhetorically position themselves—through alternatively abstract/visionary and narrowly technical vocabularies—to swallow up a world whose actual conditions of happiness, insight, and self-control may in important respects be contingent, cumulative, and time-bound, subject to disciplining restraints and material limitations not referable to, or at least in need of checked relation with, digital totality.\n\nYet I must confess to some ultimate sympathy with this religious vision: first, because I have been genuinely surprised in my brief time at MITH at how easy it has been to let go of certain formerly sacred ideas (like the traditional library: not books, but the monolithic model of the library as physically browsable warehouse), which, if not exactly a religious conversion on my part, is nevertheless the rejection of a kind of orthodoxy that I have tended to take as seriously as any other; second, because I am not surprised by but am very impressed with the transformative possibilities of productive knowledge that lie at the intersection of humanistic and scientific/empiricist method and also collaborative interchange between parties of different expertise (more on which in a moment); and third, because the digital humanities’ revolution and revelation, like all things in the Gutenberg continuum, is here to stay—the right question to ask is how to administer it in the interests of insight and justice.\n\nThis leads to Fish’s second point about the digital humanities: that it is predicated not simply on theological revolution but a sense of political revolution as well—one that seems to intertwine an insurgent and open-ended sense of who and what is and should be a part of academia with a more broadly democratic commitment to knowledge dissemination, empowerment, production, and discussion generally. In this conception of the digital humanities, Fish presents its practitioners styling themselves in genealogical descent from the 1960’s/70’s cyber- and counter-culture, and, though not inherently pegged to any particular politics in itself, the digital humanities implicitly find themselves embracing a “left agenda” that “self-identifies with civil liberties, the elimination of boundaries, a strong First Amendment, the weakening or end of copyright and Facebook/YouTube revolutions that have swept across the Arab world.”\n\nThere is too much to bite off on here that is really not germane to this blog, so let me simply advance two quick thoughts. First, though I’ve become convinced of the genuinely revolutionary possibilities (not all aspects of which, I should clarify, I am thrilled with: I am not convinced that digitality has produced a culture of better readers—though I’m not exactly convinced of the reverse either) the digital world offers to transform not only the substance but also the methods of education, it is not really clear to me that the “left agenda” described above really is predicated on political “revolution” so much as a ratification of current and dominant America/Western/neoliberal conventionalities and momentum; these values are the extension of democratic capitalism, not really—as a matter of inherent structure—affording any critical nor certainly any revolutionary counter-balance or upheaval of those processes.\n\nThis leads to a second point: that the challenge for projects like FLA, and as actually practiced in important progressive digital initiatives like the Digital Public Library of America and Carla Peterson’s Black Gotham archive and the national digital education initiatives advanced by the National Humanities Center, is not simply to assume but to think carefully about the kind of transformations the digital world can effect, and with what liabilities too. For FLA, whose archives are beginning to assume substantial proportions: I am both heartened but also concerned about who and what will benefit most from the tools it offers to analyze political manipulations of non-American-authored novels in the U.S. over time and in different political contexts.\n\nFish’s third point is his most important point, and the only one, based on my experiences at MITH, that I fundamentally differ with him on. Here, Fish essentially argues that the methods of the digital humanities are fundamentally distinct from, and not capable of supplanting or even meaningfully, in any originating way, contributing to, the kind of insights that derive from traditional humanities, as epitomized by learned, cumulative, nuanced practices of close reading.\n\nFor Fish, the big dividing line between the traditional humanities and the digital humanities is that whereas the former presuppose an interpreter/reader who originates a hypothesis, which only then becomes tested and explained and elaborated through a process of engaged reading and pattern demonstration, the digital humanities reverse this process:\n\n“First you run the numbers, and then you see if they prompt an interpretive hypothesis. The method, if it can be called that, is dictated by the capability of the tool. You have at your disposal an incredible computing power that can bring to analytical attention patterns of sameness and difference undetectable by the eye of the human reader. Because the patterns are undetectable, you don’t know in advance what they are and you cannot begin your computer-aided search (called text-mining) in a motivated — that is, interpretively directed — way. You don’t know what you’re looking for or why you’re looking for it. How then do you proceed?”\n\nBut of course you can begin pattern searches in “motivated ways.” One of the tasks we’re engaged in at FLA is trying to train computers to read big piles of data—concerning the American reception of non-American authors: we’re trying to figure out what the politics of international literary reception in the US is—based on the precedent of annotation questions we humans have asked of a smaller set of data, which the computer can project forward. Six of us, for instance, have asked of 100 American magazine articles that reference Dostoevsky and Tolstoy in the early 1900’s questions like: who is/are the principal literary author(s) discussed in this article; is a generally positive, generally negative, indeterminate, or no opinion expressed of that author; is gender an issue explicitly raised in the article; is race; is socioeconomic class; is radical politics; is America or the West invoked as a point of similarity; or contrast?\n\nNow Fish would be amusedly impatient with these questions because he knows how difficult, loaded, and ambiguous all of the key terms involved are.\n\nBut we know this too, and we spent a series of months refining our questionnaire and  developing individualized conventions for answering our questions based on specifically applying the questions to small subsets of data, week by week refining our conventions in light of problems and cruxes arising from application of those questions to data ultimately representative of a larger sample, all the while actually really proceeding on the model of legal analysis—whereby you have a legal rule or principle or statutory provision and you make your decisions case by case developing a body of hopefully consistent precedent.\n\nThe proof is in the pudding here: with our annotation questionnaire, applied blindly by two or three different team members, we have now achieved remarkable consistency across nearly all of the 17 questions we’ve sought to apply and use to annotate the data, for replication (hopefully) by a machine when patterns are extended by it to larger stockpiles of texts to analyze.\n\nWe came armed with plenty of “motivating” hypotheses—that’s why we picked the questions we did in the first place—but we’re pursuing them in tandem with the machine: first, by annotating our data in a systematic fashion whose patterns (invisible to us, and/or more extensive across great big fields of data than we can read) we hope the machine will be able to read; and second, by then being able to scrutinize keyword and collocation patterns based on the categories of annotation the machine will sort things into.\n\nFish I believe would respond—and the traditional humanist in me would agree with him—: but don’t you then actually have to go back and read (closely) yourself whatever articles sorted in whatever categories featuring whatever keywords—to understand the true meaning of those words and that article? But the answer is that the computer can help identify patterns to explore in relation to one’s hypotheses about meaning that one didn’t know existed in the first place.\n\nThe same thing is actually true of the kind of topics modeling procedures where—unsupervised by any “annotating” training or human intervention—tools like MALLET or WEKA identify clusters of words, themselves presumably organized in terms of “subject” or “topic,” in, say, a field of data that presents itself over time. I see no problem with actually letting the computer generate “topic” word strings in and of itself (though it’s more complicated than this: a human being is always playing a role in establishing the number of topics) and then trying to come up with hypotheses based on that as to what the word strings mean, how they fit together and why, But even more than this, new topic modeling procedures allow “motivated” human beings to intervene after the initial topic model generation, either to filter out or to emphasize specific words a human “expert” thinks is either very relevant or noise, so as then to generate more refined and revealing topic models.\n\nAgain, the process is a kind of dance (though I hate the sentimentality of that word) between human and machine, between technological specialist and humanist, between a substantive expert armed with hypotheses and also open to questions and puzzles and an inhumanly large field of data to which such experts have to make themselves answerable if they want to ask questions relevant to that domain in the first place. (This last point is important: if, as a humanist, you are making claims about a big field of historical textuality, and you can’t legitimate your larger claims in confirming relation to what distant reading models suggest, then maybe you are wrong—indeed, I think the burden is then on you to explain how you are actually right.)\n\nAll of which returns me to my friend Sarah, a gifted literary critic and philosopher of the ephemeral, who sent me Fish’s columns in the first place. She did this because she knows that I have deep sympathies with the note on which Fish begins his first article described above: grumbling (masterfully!) about blogs, which for him is a kind of synecdoche for the digital humanities as a whole, on the grounds of their self-consciously ephemeral character!\n\nFish has this ability to get one to argue with oneself; MITH does too. I’m very fortunate to have come into contact with them both.\n\n<em>Peter Lancelot Mallios is a MITH Faculty Fellow.

Arguing that agency is a key concept to designing play systems, Flanagan explores games, values, and the conceptual concerns inherent in the rule systems that constitute contemporary play, especially focusing on the implications of the 'gamification' of everyday life.\n\nMARY FLANAGAN is an innovator focused on how people create and use technology. Her groundbreaking explorations across the arts, humanities, and sciences represent a novel use of methods and tools that bind research with introspective cultural production. As an artist, her work ranges from game-inspired systems to computer viruses, embodied interfaces to interactive texts; these works are exhibited internationally. As a scholar interested in how human values are in play across technologies and systems, Flanagan has written more than 20 critical essays and chapters on games, empathy, gender and digital representation, art and technology, and responsible design. Her three books in English include the recent <em>Critical Play</em> (2009) with MIT Press. Flanagan founded the Tiltfactor game research laboratory in 2003, where researchers study and make social games, urban games, and software in a rigorous theory/practice environment. She is the Sherman Fairchild Distinguished Professor in Digital Humanities at Dartmouth College. <a href=\"http://www.maryflanagan.com/\">http://www.maryflanagan.com</a>; <a href=\"http://tiltfactor.org/\">http://www.tiltfactor.org</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA continuously updated schedule of talks is also available on the <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/podcast/\">Digital Dialogues webpage</a>.\n\nUnable to attend the events in person?

    "wp post content": "I am defending my dissertation this semester. When I have successfully completed this task, I will be required by the University of Maryland to submit a copy of it to be held in perpetuity by the university's library system. In fact, just about anyone who has written a Ph.D. dissertation, a Master's thesis, or even an undergraduate honors thesis at an institution of higher learning in the last century and a half has been required to do the same. And, in addition to these terminal projects, university libraries are overflowing with items such as course syllabi, exam booklets, seminar papers, and class notes. For example, you can walk into <a href=\"http://www.library.virginia.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Alderman Library at the University of Virginia</a> and read the doctoral dissertation of Woodrow Wilson. You can walk into Widener Library at Harvard and read undergraduate essays written in the 1890's by Boston journalist (and Conrad reviewer) Edwin Francis Edgett. If you're interested, you can read the <a href=\"http://www.thesesalive.ac.uk/ta_exemplary_theses.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">complete text of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's 1885 medical school dissertation</a> from the University of Edinburgh right now from the comfort of your living room couch. Like Wilson, Edgett, and Doyle, I could become famous enough during my lifetime that a person one hundred years from now will read my dissertation in order to divine from its pages the nascent genius of my later ideas. However, if I don't make it to the realm of the extreme noteworthy, will anybody be interested in reading my dissertation in 2112? Will some future librarian at the University of Maryland quietly hit the delete button and send all my years of effort into the electronic ether?\n\nOne of the projects we have underway at Foreign Literatures in America (FLA) is to save these kinds of academic documents from obscurity (and possibly oblivion.) While most go unread for decades, old dissertations and theses on literary topics present a unique opportunity for scholars – and scholarly projects such as FLA – interested in the reception history of literary texts. First, looking at such material expands the pool of critical responses quite considerably. Published items such as professional essays, scholarly monographs, book reviews, and newspaper articles are all great sources of information about literary history and each category caters to a slightly different audience. However, as we have begun to compile bibliographic metadata on the reception history of Joseph Conrad at FLA, it quickly became clear that many of the articles, books, reviews of Conrad's work over the course of his long career were actually written by a small handful of interested writers. By contrast, our initial effort to locate dissertations and theses written on Conrad in the years between 1900 and 1960, turned up two hundred and eight different projects either entirely or significantly focused on Conrad. A little digging is likely to turn up more. Even if we can locate copies of only a portion of these manuscripts, we will be able to get a broader view of Conrad's place within the academy and use the bibliographies and citations contained in these documents to map how ideas about Conrad spread and circulated over time and across space.\n\nAlso, since these documents were written for or by students they provide a glimpse into the early days of Conrad Studies in American classrooms. For example, <em>Heart of Darkness</em> is now the most common gateway text, appearing on most syllabi of introductory English courses. But was this always the case? Have other Conrad texts gone through periods of prominence and obscurity on college campuses? How quickly do ideas trickle down from professional scholarship on Conrad to student-generated writing?\n\nFinally, the relatively large size of the data set available from student papers makes possible comparative scholarship between different subsets of the student population. For example, almost half of the available academic projects on Conrad were written by female students. This alone is a somewhat surprising fact given Conrad's reputation as a \"masculine\" author. Will we see differences in focus, emphasis, or approach towards Conrad's work based on gender? If present, will these differences change over time?\n\nWe are excited that FLA will provide a full-text, searchable repository for the often excellent and unfortunately obscure scholarship on foreign authors done by generations of American students. Personally, I will be pleased if in 2112 a future user of the FLA database runs an algorithm in which my dissertation provides a data point. Oh, immortality.\n\n<em>Rebecca Borden is a Ph.D. candidate in English at the University of Maryland.  Her dissertation is titled \"Making Meaning Together: Information, Propaganda, and Rumor in British Fiction of the First World War.\" She is also the Executive Editor for Modern British Literature at FLA.</em>",

    "wp post content": "First Annual Nebraska Digital Workshop\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCenter for Digital Research in the Humanities (CDRH) University of Nebraska-Lincoln September 22-23, 2006\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Center for Digital Research in the Humanities (CDRH) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln will host the first annual Nebraska Digital Workshop on September 22-23, 2006 and seeks proposals for digital presentations by pre-tenure faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and advanced graduate students working in digital humanities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWorkshop Goals\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe goal of the Workshop is to enable the best early-career scholars in the field of digital humanities, including but not limited to, English, History, and Modern Languages, to present their work in a forum where it can be critically evaluated, improved, and showcased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the auspices of the CDRH research faculty and staff-a group that includes CDHR Co-Directors Kenneth M. Price and Katherine L. Walter, Brett Barney, Andrew Jewell, Brian Pytlik Zillig, Douglas Seefeldt, William G. Thomas, III, and Judellen Thornton-J=E4ringe-the Nebraska Digital Workshop will offer opportunities to discuss the potential of humanities computing, present examples of successful projects created at the CDRH, offer a new tools workshop, share strategies for developing administrative and institutional support for digital humanities scholarship at the applicants' home institutions, and share external funding and grant-writing tips. The Workshop ultimately endeavors to foster a network of digital scholars who will come together across disciplinary boundaries at the workshop, and who in the future will advance humanities computing and help define the state of digital scholarship. For information on the Center for Digital Research in the Humanities and faculty/staff biographies, see http://cdrh.unl.edu.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Workshop will supplement its roster by bringing two nationally recognized senior scholars in digital humanities to Lincoln to participate and work with the scholars whose work is selected for presentation. This year, the Workshop coincides with the Department of History's third annual Pauley Symposium on the topic \"History in the Digital Age,\" a gathering of top digital historians that will include: Abdul Alkalimat, University of Toledo; Edward L. Ayers, University of Virginia; Peter Bol, Harvard University; Alan Liu, University of California, Santa Barbara; John Lutz, University of Victoria; Patrick Manning, Northeastern University; Mary Beth Norton, Cornell University; Jan Reiff, University of California, Los Angeles; Roy Rosenzweig, George Mason University and Robert Schwartz, Mt. Holyoke College. Two of these digital humanists will participate in the Workshop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTravel, Lodging and Honoraria\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe CDRH will pay for travel and lodging expenses and scholars will receive an honorarium for presenting their work at the Nebraska Digital Workshop. Workshop participants will also be invited to all of the Pauley Symposium \"History in the Digital Age\" events.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSelection Criteria\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApplicants are encouraged to submit a three-page narrative abstract for an approximately 30-minute presentation of their digital project along with files of, or links to, any digital elements, electronic text, analytical tools, or multimedia visualizations already created. Applicants who are earlier in the production phase of their digital project may also submit descriptive text that explains their plans for such digital materials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSelection criteria include: the significance of the project in primary disciplinary field, elements of technical innovation, theoretical and methodological sophistication, and creativity of approach to the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Apply\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApplicants are asked to send a proposed workshop abstract, curriculum vitae, and a representative sample of digital work via a URL or disk to William G. Thomas, III, Chair, Nebraska Digital Workshop Committee, via email attachment at wgt@unl.edu or via surface mail at 615 Oldfather Hall, UNL, Lincoln NE 68588-0327.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDeadline\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe deadline for applications is May 1, 2006.",

Most such work focuses on explicitly expressed opinions, e.g. automatically labeling movie reviews as favorable or unfavorable. In this talk, we will focus on a less studied problem: the computational analysis of implicit sentiment, or spin, in text. We identify underlying semantic properties of statements that predict perceptions of sentiment, and we show how observable syntactic reflexes of those properties can be used, fully automatically, to accurately label a text as expressing a positive or negative attitude toward its topic, even in the absence of overtly opinionated language.\r\r\n\r\r\nDr. STEPHAN GREENE is a recent Ph.D. graduate of the UMD Department of Linguistics, and works at ATG, a leading provider of Web marketing and e-commerce software.\r\r\n\r\r\nDr. PHILIP RESNIK is an associate professor at UMD with joint appointments in the Department of Linguistics and the Institute for Advanced Computer Studies.\r\r\n\r\r\nComing up @MITH: November 27, LINDA FRUEH (The Internet Archive), \"The Internet Archive and the Digital Humanities.\" [Jonathan Auerbach's talk, originally scheduled for that day, has been postponed until next semester.]\r\r\n\r\r\nView MITH's complete Fall Speakers Schedule here:\r\r\n\r\r\n<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100615144449/http://www.mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_fall_2007.pdf\">http://www.mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_fall_2007.pdf</a>\r\r\n\r\r\nAll talks free and open to the public!\r\r\n\r\r\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-8927).",

In this presentation, Jeremy Boggs will discuss project management approaches and design/development process for digital humanities. The talk will cover initial planning for a project, working with various personnel, creating time frames and milestones, establishing an in-house design and development process, and connecting with users once a project is public.\n\n\n\nJEREMY BOGGS is the Creative Lead at the Center for History and New Media, where he leads the web design and development team and is the project manager for Omeka. He is also a PhD student in the Department of History and Art History at George Mason University. His dissertation focuses on the history of cascading style sheets as a design language for the Web. His research interests include the history of technology, history of design, and US cultural history. You can learn more about Jeremy at his website, ClioWeb (clioweb.org).\n\n\n\nComing up @MITH 2/17: Jean Dryden (iSchool), \"Copyright in the Real World\"\n\n\n\nView MITH's complete Digital Dialogues schedule here:\n\n\n\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20100615144914/http://www.mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_spring_2009.pdf\n\n\n\nAll talks free and open to the public!\n\n\n\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-8927).",

We may know a lot about the dancer (Shakespeare's works) from the waist up, but digital analysis allows us to identify interesting moves taking place below the waist.\n\n\n\nThis talk will be held in 2115 Tawes Hall.\n\n\n\nMichael Witmore became Director of the Folger Shakespeare Library on July 1, 2011. He was formerly Professor of English at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and he has served as Associate Professor of English and Assistant Professor of English at Carnegie Mellon University.\n\n\n\nThe recipient of numerous fellowships, he has held an Andrew Mellon Postdoctoral Fellowship at the University of California, Los Angeles, a research fellowship and a curatorial residency fellowship at the Folger, and a predoctoral fellowship at the Max-Planck-Institut für Wissenschaftsgeschichte in Berlin. Dr. Witmore earned an A.B. in English at Vassar College, and an M.A. and Ph.D. in rhetoric at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\n\n\nAmong his more recent projects, he launched the Working Group for Digital Inquiry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and organized the Pittsburgh Consortium for Medieval and Renaissance Studies. His publications include numerous articles, website resources, and book chapters, and he has published five books: <em>Landscapes of the Passing Strange: Reflections from Shakespeare</em>, with Rosamond Purcell (2010), <em>Shakespearean Metaphysics</em> (2009), <em>Pretty Creatures; Children and Fiction in the English Renaissance</em> (2007), <em>Childhood and Children's Books in Early Modern Europe</em>, 1550-1800 (2006), and <em>Culture of Accidents: Unexpected Knowledges in Early Modern England</em> (2001). In addition, he has given scores of presentations and been invited to serve on numerous academic panels. He currently has several books in progress, including a study of early modern wisdom literature and a book on the nature of digital inquiry in the humanities. He will co-curate an exhibition for the Folger in the fall of 2012 tentatively titled \"<em>Very Like a Whale</em>.\"\n\n\n\nA continuously updated schedule of talks is also available on the Digital Dialogues webpage.\n\n\n\nUnable to attend the events in person?\n\n\n\nArchived podcasts can be found on the MITH website, and you can follow our Digital Dialogues Twitter account @digdialog as well as the Twitter hashtag #mithdd to keep up with live tweets from our sessions.\n\n\n\nAll talks free and open to the public. Attendees are welcome to bring their own lunches.",

    "wp post content": "The Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) is proud to announce the launch of the prototype of Music Theatre Online (MTO), a freely accessible web-based archive of musical and music theatre. Funded by a Digital Humanities Startup grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, MTO provides a model for online scholarly archives of the exceptionally multimodal art form of music theatre.   “Under the inspired leadership of Doug Reside,” comments MITH Director Neil Fraistat, “MTO promises to revolutionize the study of musical theatre, and adds to an increasing number of MITH projects involving the performing arts.”\n\nThe MTO prototype makes available, with the generous permission of creators James Gardiner and Nick Blaemire, audio and video files, photographs, and seventeen TEI encoded drafts of the 2008 Broadway musical, Glory Days charting the development of the show from early sketches through regional productions to opening night.  For several versions of the show, the lyrics have been linked to audio transcriptions of related performances, allowing a reader to closely study both text and music simultaneously.\n\nGlory Days is the first in what we hope will be a continuing series of musicals added to the collection in the coming years.  Upcoming titles under development include the 1866 melodrama The Black Crook and the 1920 Jerome Kern musical, Sally.  The prototype is available at <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/mto\">http://mith.umd.edu/mto</a>.",

Much of the change is in styling and branding, but there are new texts added, some new views, and a new naming convention.\n\n<em><strong>New</strong></em><strong> <em>texts.</em></strong> Gradually, I am replacing the sample files with just <em>Bava Metsi’a</em> Ch. 2 with transcriptions covering all of tractate Neziqin (the Bavot). Currently, this applies to the Maimonides autograph, Paris BNF Héb. 328-329, and the Naples <em>editio princeps</em> (with the marginalia from the copy in the National Library of Israel.) Work is ongoing on other witnesses. Some new Genizah fragments have been added, and, in the next release, I hope to be able to show some samples of virtually joined manuscripts that can be broken out into the individual fragments.\n\n<em><strong>New views</strong><strong>.</strong></em> Users can now browse through documents page by page or column by column, and they can see witnesses chunked by chapter in a compact view.\n\n<em><strong>New naming convention.</strong></em> Sigla for the manuscripts will now be based on the recent <em>Thesaurus of Talmudic Manuscripts</em>. Print editions will be based on serial numbers in similar format. We are experimenting with a convention for sigla that is slightly more informative, so that it will be possible to tell that a given witness includes the Mishnah alone, or a commentary in Hebrew or Arabic, and perhaps other data such as region and date of hand. (This last will require expert typing of the manuscripts.)\n\n<em>Hayim Lapin is Robert H. Smith Professor of Jewish Studies and Professor in the Department of History at the University of Maryland.

The first is a working meeting for invited participants, which will take place on Thursday, October 18, 2018, on the University of Maryland campus in College Park, MD, as a pre-conference event for AADHum’s <a href=\"https://aadhum.umd.edu/conference/\"><i>Intentionally Digital, Intentionally Black</i></a> conference. The second, the idea for which we have gratefully borrowed from the <a href=\"https://collectionsasdata.github.io/\">Collections as Data</a> team, is open to all.\n\n\n\nWe invite the broader community to engage with us online. <b>Please consider sharing a brief statement to help us shape our face-to-face meeting.</b> This is a great way to get your concerns, questions, and provocations on the table as well as to share your background.

We are particularly interested, through this meeting and through follow on activities, in topics such as broadening the constituencies for black digital collections, ownership and agency in shared collections, as well as beginning and sustaining collaborations.\n\n\n\nWe will include these position statements in our public reporting on the meeting (with the permission of contributors).\n\n\n\n&nbsp;",

    "wp post content": "This has been a wild month for the BitCurator project here at MITH. First of all, as the grant funded portion of the BitCurator project has drawn to a close, we have established a member-based consortium to be the ongoing home of the BitCurator environment. The BitCurator Consortium (BCC) will be a member-led organization to pick up where the grant funded portion of BitCurator left off. In my conversations with BitCurator users I like to emphasize this point: the BitCurator project has not ended just because the grant period is over. Far from it! The outreach, training, and other community engagement efforts of the BitCurator team over the last year have established an active and growing user base who are committed to the ongoing development of the BitCurator environment. What’s more, both UNC School of Information and Library Science (SILS) and MITH are charter members of the BitCurator Consortium and will continue to be actively engaged in the project. You can learn more about the consortium and see a list of member organizations who have already joined the BCC <a href=\"http://www.bitcurator.net/bitcurator-consortium/\">here on the BitCurator Consortium</a> page of the BitCurator website.\n\nIn addition to the establishment of the BCC, we were proud to announce <a href=\"http://www.umdrightnow.umd.edu/news/umd-releases-digital-forensic-software-libraries\">the release of BitCurator 1.0</a> last week. This is a major milestone for us and represents the culmination of three years of dedicated development work. The BitCurator 1.0 release includes a major update to the BitCurator Disk Image Access tool--a tool that allows users to view the full content of a disk image, including hidden and deleted files, and export those files to a directory. Other recent updates include a revised safe mounting tool that allows users to mount disks in read only mode, the inclusion of the Library of Congress’s Bagger tool, and an updated version of bulk_extractor. To learn more and to download the latest version of BitCurator, please visit our wiki at <a href=\"http://wiki.bitcurator.net/index.php?title=Main_Page\">wiki.bitcurator.net</a>.\n\nAs the BitCurator Community Lead over the past year, it has been my pleasure to get to know the members of this community and learn about the challenges they face as they begin processing their born-digital collections. It has been rewarding to see the adoption of the BitCurator environment as an important part of addressing those issues and to see the BitCurator community take a leadership role in this area. I look forward to seeing both the BitCurator environment and the BitCurator community grow and develop as we take this next and necessary step in the maturation of the BitCurator project.",

Unfortunately, as paper is a static media, this web often gets trapped in the physical world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo address these limitations, we propose PapierCraft, a gesture-based interface that allows users to manipulate digital documents directly using their printouts as proxies. Using a digital pen, users can annotate a printout or draw command gestures to indicate operations such as copying a document area, pasting an area previously copied, or creating a link. Upon pen synchronization, our infrastructure executes these commands and presents the result in a customized viewer. In this talk I will describe the design and implementation of the PapierCraft command system, and report on early user feedback.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Acting Director, MITH (mith@umd.edu, 5-5896).",

    "wp post content": "Out of the blue, an archivist gets a call from the husband of a famous scientist who has recently passed away. He wants to donate materials to the archives that can help people to understand and learn about her research. The archivist visits their home and is handed a cardboard box. Inside are not sheets of paper but a stack of floppy disks, CDs, Zip disks and a hard drive. What’s the archivist to do?\n\nResearchers at the <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/\">Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH)</a> at the University of Maryland, and the <a href=\"http://sils.unc.edu\">School of Information and Library Science (SILS)</a> at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill are investigating methods and developing tools for these sorts of situations.\n\nA new white paper titled, <a href=\"http://www.bitcurator.net/docs/bitstreams-to-heritage.pdf\">“From Bitstreams to Heritage: Putting Digital Forensics into Practice in Collecting Institutions”</a> examines the application of digital forensics methods to materials in collecting institutions – particularly libraries, archives and museums. It is a product of the BitCurator project and is written by <strong>Drs. Christopher A. Lee</strong>, Frances Carroll McColl Term Professor and research associate, <strong>Kam Woods </strong>of SILS; <strong>Matthew Kirschenbaum</strong>, associate director of MITH; and SILS doctoral student <strong>Alexandra Chassanoff</strong>.\n\n”The landscape has changed quite dramatically in the past few years,” said Lee. “The white paper reflects a great deal of energy and progress around the work of extracting, securing and describing information that’s been stored on computer disks and drives.”\n\nThe BitCurator project, funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, is “an effort to build, test and analyze systems and software for incorporating digital forensics methods into the workflows of a variety of collecting institutions.” Procedures and tools for acquiring and validating data from physical media are well established in the field of digital forensics. There is a rich and growing body of open source tools that can be used to process, manage and disseminate forensically acquired data. While the primary target for many of these tools and methods is the law enforcement community, there is great potential for connecting these two streams of activity in order to support the work of collecting institutions.\n\nBitCurator is developing and disseminating a dedicated open-source software environment that can be used to apply digital forensics methods to collections. The software and associated guidance documents are freely available from the project’s wiki: <a href=\"http://wiki.bitcurator.net\">wiki.bitcurator.net</a>\n\nAccording to the white paper, “Forensic methods identify, capture and retain various forms of contextual information, which can be vital for users making meaningful use of digital materials.” It explains those processes, along with many associated challenges and opportunities\n\n\"BitCurator now moves into a critical next phase, with a full-time dedicated Community Lead based at MITH whose mandate is outreach to collecting institutions,” said Kirschenbaum. “We look forward to working with a wide variety of archives, special collections, museums and other constituencies to create a robust user community around our platform.\"\n\nThe white paper is now available here: <a title=\"BitCurator White Paper\" href=\"http://www.bitcurator.net/docs/bitstreams-to-heritage.pdf\">Bitstreams to Heritage</a>",

    "wp post content": "Call me Ahab: I’m the leader of the merry band of pirates about to set sail on the <a title=\"Foreign Literatures in America\" href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/research/fla/\" target=\"_blank\">Foreign Literatures in America</a> (FLA) project. If there’s one thing I like most about this project, it’s the white whaleness of it all: none of us is sure exactly where we are headed, but we are all equipped with charts and tools, sextants and harpoons, hints and intuitions, hypotheses, methodologies, and curiosities, furled into the service of a collective determination to sail as far away from conventional understandings of “American literature” as possible, seeking new horizons of its terms in the most distant and elusive spaces—whose “foreign” composition becomes ultimately understood as a global constituent of U.S. literature and culture itself.\n\nI expect enemies to this project—I certainly hope for some!: it would be no fun without them—but I must confess (un-Ahab-like as this sentiment may be: I fear I am growing soft) that new horizons of friendship and collaboration, far beyond what I have ever personally experienced in the humanities beyond the special teacher-student relationship, are the most exciting aspect of this project thus far. Let me explain—though do please keep this “nice” stuff between us. I have a reputation to maintain, and the whales are always listening.\n\nAt some basic level, FLA is predicated on the generative assumption and insight—one I argue for at length in my book <a href=\"http://www.sup.org/book.cgi?id=12129\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Our Conrad: Constituting American Modernity</em></a> (2010), and one I am further elaborating in a new book project on the history of foreign authored literature in the U.S., entitled <em>On Foreign Grounds: Reimagining American Literature</em>—that we make a mistake in traditionally defining “American literature” in terms of literary works written by national citizens of the U.S. In fact historically speaking, some of the most influential literature in the United States—as a matter of literary significance, material circulation, and social, cultural and political force—has been written by non-American authors from across the globe, as well as non-American immigrants living within the U.S. This is not a matter of “American” literature being parsable in both national and hemispheric terms, nor is it a matter of “America” being an explicit subject in planetary literature, or a place a foreign author once visited and wrote about. It’s a matter of the terrain of U.S. literature and culture—what the literature of the U.S. itself has been—being constituted just as much by \"foreign” authored as “native” authored texts. This interweave between the two plays a vital role in the construction and contestation of the nation – space and – state of the fluctuating territorial expanse of the U.S. and its relation to the rest of the planet.\n\n“Foreign Literatures in America” is not a project of reinforcing the distinction between “foreign” and “American”: it is a project of evoking so as to neutralize this very distinction. The “foreign” here becomes indigenous to, integral of, recovered as a material constituent of the U.S. itself—not filtered out through some abstract conception of “American” literature; it is restored as part of the terrain and earth of what literature has been in the U.S.\n\nThough I had expected enemies to this project—it rifles its fingers through many controversial elements of both Americanist and world literature discourse, humanistic versus scientific inquiry, distant versus close reading, without confining itself to any  opposition—I’ve noticed as we’ve moved forward, truly remarkable networks of collaboration, productivity, genuine friendship and intellectual generosity that are the defining note of our “voyage” thus far. Through the collective effort of a crack team of undergraduates in the <a href=\"http://www.gemstone.umd.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">University of Maryland Gemstone Honors Program</a>, and different teams of remarkable doctoral students and faculty scholars at and outside the University of Maryland, FLA has begun to generate not only archives but <strong>questions</strong> that I don’t think any of us had foreseen at the outset. The friends we keep making, and depend on very much for collaborative scholarship, are absolutely integral to our project.\n\nThis raises the second element of FLA. Everything I’ve just said about dialogue and cooperation also applies to the interactive work and conversations that have been happening between us “humanists” and the digital humanities and computational experts who are—so very generously—working with us at the <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH)</a>. The methodology of parsing both the strategic database archives we are assembling and the “big data” that is already out there, through topic modeling and sentiment analysis tools, have generated re-orientations of thinking about the reading of human culture. The bridging of American and world literary coordinates and the bridging of the humanistic and quantitative strategies come together in this project—which also allows for abrasion between these neat dyads too. But both <strong>what</strong> we understand as American literature and <strong>how</strong> we understand and interpret this new American literature becomes dramatically changed, or at least opened, by this project, as a matter of its defining mission and aspirations.\n\nIf this sounds a bit contradictory and uncertain, well, so it is, so it is. Our plan is to immerse in the destructive element, and let the deep, deep sea keep us up.\n\n<em>Peter Lancelot Mallios is a MITH Faculty Fellow. He directs the Foreign Literatures in America Project and is a professor in English at the University of Maryland.</em>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;",

    "wp post content": "As is generally the case with things intellectual, progress on my digital archive has been quite slow.\n\nI have several \"handlers\" (as I call them) at MITH and they are all terrific. Kirsten Keister is responsible for the design of this website which I think is truly elegant—and she did it in record time. Emma Millon is going to teach me how to post my blog entries in a couple of hours so hopefully I will be posting this one myself! Seth Denbo is my number one handler and we have had great conversations about content. He set up a detailed timetable for me a couple of weeks ago, made up of four stages and thirteen items to get through. The problem is I've only gotten through one item even though it's already November 17! The main sticking point seems to be in getting permissions for the images and manuscript material I want to use. Here's hoping that that gets sorted out soon!\n\nSo this waiting period has given me a lot of time to brood. It's in my nature to be a worry wart, and in particular to revisit decisions I've already made and can't go back on. Except that in my mind I can. So I repeatedly fret over whether I should have written an article on X topic rather than Y, whether I should have opened my chapter with this vignette rather than that one, whether I should have placed my qualifying phrase at the beginning or end of the sentence. For me, the possibilities are endless. So it is with my decision to go digital. Should I have applied for a MITH fellowship? Do I really want to create a digital archive? What am I losing in do so? What am I gaining?  In other words, what's the virtue of virtuality?\n\nI have to confess that right now I worry most about what I think the virtual world of digital media <em>cannot</em> give me. After the publication of <em>Black Gotham</em> this past February I went on book tour throughout the spring and, after a summer hiatus, started up again in September. Of course, I've loved talking about my book and teaching my audiences about New York's pre-Harlem world. But the best part has been making new friends. I'll meet somebody at one event, only to see them show up a few weeks later someplace else. This leads to many \"Oh my goshes, it's you again,\" hugs, chatter, and laughter.\n\nSometimes these meetings occur by happenstance. I was introduced to Celesti Colds Fechter at a talk I gave at the New School. She's writing a biography of a black woman, Amanda Foster, who worked for Washington Irving in his home, became close to him, and is buried near him in the Sleepy Hollow cemetery. I then bumped into Celesti at the ASLH annual meeting where I was giving a paper on black New Yorkers during the Civil War. At other times these encounters are deliberate. Jaime Estrada, a senior at Smith College, heard me talk at the Harlem Book Fair in July and made a point of coming to my presentation at the Museum of African American History in Boston this fall. In one of these truly small world moments, that event allowed me to reconnect with a former Radcliffe classmate, Chandra Harrington who is the current head of MAAH.\n\nSome folks come bearing gifts. At the New School Michelle Materre gave me a CD of a film, <em>That's My Face</em>, by Thomas Allen Harris, who I had met some weeks earlier at his own event showcasing his new project, <a href=\"http://ddfr.tv/\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Diaspora TV Family Reunion</a>. After we appeared on a panel together at the Congressional Black Caucus Convention, Booker T. Mattison gave me a copy of his latest novel Snitch, which I'm half way through and really enjoying. Others offer dinner. Michael Henry Adams, author of <em>Harlem: Lost and Found</em> and blogger for the <em>Huffington Post</em>, came to my talk at Columbia University and then came to listen to me again at the Schomburg, sweeping me off to dinner afterwards with his friend Tom Wirth. Jasmin Williams has given me friendship. She photographed me when I spoke from the pulpit at St. Philip's Church last February and then did a lengthy interview with me that was published in the Amsterdam News a couple of months later. Now you can find the two of us having drinks in any one of Harlem's numerous watering holes. Finally, book talks have led to more invitations. After I spoke at the Reginald Lewis Museum, Donna Hollie emailed me to ask me to speak at the Baltimore chapter of the Afro-American Historical and Genealogical Society.\n\nAll of these encounters have reminded me of Benedict Anderson's contention in <em>Imagined Communities</em> that in the \"primordial village\" people were able to relate to one another based on the fact that they all lived right next to each other, saw and talked to one another all the time. But, Anderson argued, once a social group becomes larger than the primordial village, its members need to find other ways of maintaining this sense of common belonging. In his words, \"all communities larger than primordial villages of face-to face contact (and perhaps even these) are imagined. Communities are to be distinguished, not by their falsity/ genuineness, but by the style in which they are imagined.\" According to Anderson, in the early modern period they did so by inventing the new technology of print, and imagining one another through the newspaper and the novel. Now, it seems, that new media has become old and we have taken to imagining community through the new digital media.\n\nThat's what's got me so worried. Will my <em>Black Gotham Digital Archive</em> replace the wonderful face-to-face contacts I've had throughout my book tour? Is there a way in which I can think of these two different forms of media not in terms of an either/or proposition but a both/and? Can I find a way to mesh the two together? Can I encounter people through my digital archive and then meet in person to exchange ideas, gifts, and maybe even get together for dinner? I certainly hope so!\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">___________</p>\n<em>editor's note</em>: Carla L. Peterson is professor of English at the University of Maryland.

If you'd like to be placed on a waiting list, please email <a href=\"mailto:mith@umd.edu\">mith@umd.edu</a>. </i>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Understanding the contents of institutional and digital collections and their connections to other related material can be daunting. Increasingly researchers, institutions and a broader public can work together, using crowdsourcing and linked open to meaningfully enrich and connect collections. </span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This panel and workshop, planned in conjunction with the <a href=\"https://radiopreservation.org/\">2017 Radio Preservation Task Force Conference</a>, will focus on innovative workflows for crowdsourcing linked data to build a web of data that can bridge collective heritage. Both researchers interested in learning to access more information about radio collections and collection managers will benefit from this cross-disciplinary event. </span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Panelists will discuss their work and research in crowdsourcing or linked open data for radio collections. Subsequently, a two-hour workshop will introduce the core principles behind the data structure and framework for Wikidata, and demonstrate how it can be used to connect archival radio collections to a broader web-based community of knowledge.</span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Moderator: </span><a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/people/person/stephanie-sapienza/\"><b>Stephanie Sapienza</b></a> (​Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities)\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Panelists:</span>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/sadads\"><b>Alex Stinson</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> (Wikimedia Foundation) will highlight how Wikidata is being used by diverse cultural heritage organizations around the world, including by the Archive of the Finnish Public Radio organization (Yle), the Social Network of Archival Collections (SNAC), and by other heritage organizations as diverse as the Metropolitan Museum and university libraries working to make their collections better connected with the world of linked open data through Wikidata.  </span>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/CaseyEDavis1\"><b>Casey Davis Kaufman</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kcariani\"><b>Karen Cariani</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> (WGBH Boston/American Archive for Public Broadcasting) will showcase the their IMLS-funded crowdsourcing project FIX IT, an online game that allows members of the public to help AAPB professional archivists improve the searchability and accessibility of more than 40,000 hours of digitized, historic public media content.</span>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/HoytEric\"><b>Eric Hoyt</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> (University of Wisconsin-Madison) will reflect on his work developing the Media History Digital Library’s search platform, Lantern, and data mining application, Arclight. He will also discuss methods that users can use to translate their data into new queries and interpret and share the results.</span>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/digitaleffie\"><b>Effie Kapsalis</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> (Smithsonian Institution Archives): will share the Smithsonian Institution Archives’ (SIA) methods for enriching and sharing their collections through crowdsourcing, with a particular focus on the institutional challenges of implementing such projects. Since 2005, SIA experimented with publishing minimum metadata about little-known women in the history of science, and recruiting constituents on various platforms (blogs, institutional websites, Flickr Commons, Wikipedia, Smithsonian Transcription Center) to fill in the ‘unknowns.’ These experiments have led to rich collections records on the Smithsonian’s websites, complete Wikipedia articles, and improved digital resources on female scientists for the public. Today SIA is leading a pan-Smithsonian pilot to make a large contribution to Wikidata. </span>\n\n<h3><strong>Workshop </strong></h3>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the workshop, we will provide a basic introduction to Wikidata and then use Wikidata to develop more robust context for an archival radio collection. We will connect Wikidata with authority records pulled from descriptive metadata about the National Association of Educational Broadcasters (NAEB) collection at the University of Maryland/American Archive of Public Broadcasting. We will use that linked data to demonstrate visualizations and other potential applications of Wikidata for research, including unearthing other authority records and digital web resources about people, places, and other entities, showing network relationships between various metadata items, and asking questions to better understand the context of the collection.</span>\n\n<h3>About Wikidata</h3>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A sister project of Wikipedia, Wikidata is a human and machine readable platform that allows for crowdsourcing to enrich metadata and access linked open data content from free and open vocabularies and data projects, such as the Getty vocabularies, the Social Network of Archival Content (SNAC), and others. Wikidata maintains many of the dynamics of the widely popular encyclopedia: it's free and open, editorial decisions are made by the community participating in the project, and the content is multilingual, supporting hundreds of languages. </span>",

We resolved that our present, proposed, and future activities are  interdependent and complementary and should be oriented towards working together to overcome barriers, and to create a shared environment where technology services can interoperate and be sustained, thus enabling new forms of research in the Humanities.\n\nIn order to achieve these goals we agreed to form the Coalition of Humanities and Arts Infrastructures and Networks -- CHAIN. CHAIN will act as a forum for areas of shared interest to its participants, including:\n<ul>\n\t<li>advocacy for an improved  digital research infrastructure for the Humanities;</li>\n\t<li>development of sustainable business models;</li>\n\t<li>promotion of technical interoperability of resources, tools and services;</li>\n\t<li>promotion of good practice and relevant technical standards;</li>\n\t<li>development of a shared service infrastructure;</li>\n\t<li>coordinating approaches to legal and ethical issues;</li>\n\t<li>interactions with other relevant computing infrastructure initiatives;</li>\n\t<li>widening the geographical scope of our coalition.</li>\n</ul>\nCHAIN will promote an open culture where experiences, including successes and failures, can be shared and discussed, in order to support and promote the use of digital technologies in research in the Humanities.\n<ul>\n\t<li>Sheila Anderson, King's College, London (DARIAH)</li>\n\t<li>Andreas Aschenbrenner, State and University Library GÃ¶ttingen (TextGrid, DARIAH)</li>\n\t<li>David Greenbaum, University of California, Berkeley (Project Bamboo)</li>\n\t<li>Seth Denbo, King's  College, London (DARIAH)</li>\n\t<li>Neil Fraistat, University of Maryland (centerNet)</li>\n\t<li>Chad Kainz, University of Chicago (Project Bamboo)</li>\n\t<li>Steven Krauwer, Utrecht University (CLARIN)</li>\n\t<li>Lorna Hughes, King's  College, London (ADHO, NoC)</li>\n\t<li>Tobias Blanke, King's College, London (DARIAH)</li>\n\t<li>Torsten Reimer, King's  College, London (arts-humanities.net)</li>\n\t<li>David Robey, University of Oxford (NoC)</li>\n\t<li>Harold Short, King's  College, London  (ADHO)</li>\n\t<li>Katherine Walter, University of Nebraska-Lincoln (centerNet)</li>\n\t<li>Peter Wittenburg, Max-Planck-Gesellschaft (CLARIN)</li>\n\t<li>Martin Wynne, University of Oxford (CLARIN, DARIAH)</li>\n</ul>",

The fellowship has directly supported me this semester as I wrote the draft of my second dissertation chapter, which I sent to my advisor in May upon completion. It was a privilege to have the opportunity to present my research to an audience of scholars at MITH in April and to receive immediate feedback on the project (the video can be accessed <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/331467926\"><span class=\"s1\">here</span></a>). In the days following this talk, I was able to participate in a public discussion at MITH with Robert Sonderman, a retired Regional Curator for the National Park Service (NPS) who specializes in document and object storage for the NPS, moderated by Ricardo Punzalan and Mary Alexander (co-directors of the Museum Scholarship and Material Culture Program at the University of Maryland iSchool). Discussing my own research in both of these venues served as an opportunity for me to receive invaluable feedback on my own project, and also to contribute to a constructive dialogue. In this blog post, I will take the opportunity to discuss further what the Winnemore fellowship afforded my research, and I will attempt to use this post demystify the dissertation research and chapter writing process for dissertating PhD candidates by providing some productive suggestions that helped me to write this chapter, and that I hope will help future dissertating PhD students.</p>\n\n<p class=\"p1\">No one tells you how to write a dissertation, nor can they. Rather, it is a process of continual writing, feedback, and <i>of course</i> subsequent revision. Writing this chapter was an opportunity for me to integrate the lessons I learned from committee members’ remarks on my previous chapter. My project, which sits at the convergence of digital studies, critical information science, and cultural studies, engages with a wide scope—knowing what I wanted to argue at the beginning of the chapter was essential. Chapter writing takes twists and turns—in my previous chapter, when a fascinating informational trail led my attention, I quickly followed it. Yet, a chapter needs clear structure, and a cohesive core argument. A clear (roughly) 50-page chapter must tell a story in a transparent manner—in writing this chapter, controlling those urges to tunnel too far down any single rabbit hole was vital (as fascinating as each of those holes may be…) When writing this current chapter, I began with a regimented outline and schedule (much more so than in my first chapter)—this proved to be essential in my own writing process, which helped me adhere to a single argument. Becoming more self-aware of my own writing process—knowing what habits work, what my own limitations are, and what I can improve on immediately—helped me to make this my most productive dissertation-writing semester, by far. This structure materialized in the formation of my chapter: I divided my chapter into four clear sections from the outset. While I did change some supporting evidence for each of the four sections, I was sure to keep the overall argumentative approach of the chapter intact, which has helped me to write a coherent argument across a 50-page chapter, as opposed to the conference paper length (6-10 pages) or seminar paper length (20-25 pages) graduate students in my field typically prepare for. Writing four connected conference papers proved to be the better model for writing this chapter, advice imparted to me by a committee member. Without falling <i>too</i> deep into the specifics of my chapter, picking four major keywords to ground each section was one technique I adopted to structure my writing. In my case, the entire chapter focuses on programmable storage media, which I read as <i>digital containers</i>. The sections that connect this chapter revolved around four keywords that speak to the concept of ‘containment’—<i>vectors</i>, <i>planes</i>, <i>systems</i>, and <i>circulation</i>. (There was some controlled shift in these terms over the semester, though the ideas behind them remained intact). Each of these terms focused on selected examples of containment, which follow their own trajectory—from physical objects like <i>punched cards</i> and <i>NAND flash memory</i> to virtualized instantiations like <i>Docker containers</i> and containerization within larger <i>cloud compute services</i>. Having regular access to MITH developers like Ed Summers, who I was able to discuss technical concepts with and receive feedback from, substantially helped to deepen my analyses and accelerate the writing process.</p>\n\n<p class=\"p1\">In graduate school, <i>time</i> feels like an indulgence—at the dissertation phase, time to visit sites in the field, take notes, conduct interviews, read recent publications, and parse through this mountain of information is impractical without the temporal-freedom to do so. In my five years in my PhD program (and the preceding two years I spent in my MA program), this has been the sole semester I have been funded to support my research (in opposition to compensation for teaching or for working as a faculty research assistant, or RA), which I have been able to use to direct my full attention to my scholarship, an experience that I will remain endlessly grateful for. I decided that with this rare open chunk of time to devote fully to my dissertation, the best use of this time would be to maximize my attention on facilities at the center of my research, many of which are nearby and within the greater Washington, DC area. Moreover, it is the kind of deep dive into research that is near impossible to balance with typical teaching obligations of two courses per semester. Site visits, interviews, and archival research are among the most time intensive aspects of dissertation research, but I knew they would also be the most fruitful for me. So, I arranged site visits at the Library of Congress (Washington, DC), the Library of Congress offsite storage facility (Ft. Meade, MD), the Severn Library offsite storage facility here at the University of Maryland (College Park, MD), the Smithsonian Museum Support Center (Suitland, MD), an Amazon fulfillment center (Richmond, VA), and the Library of Congress National Audiovisual Conservation Center (NAVCC in Culpeper, VA). Moreover, I also conducted phone/skype discussions and recorded interviews remotely with scholars or representatives from the University of Pittsburgh, ReCAP (a major library consortium), and the NAVCC. Over the summer I have plans still to visit sites including ReCAP, the National Archives, and a second Amazon fulfillment center (another location, which is built around a different logistical system). Outside of these major discussions, I had conversations or email exchanges with many other individuals willing to make the time to speak with me about their work. As for almost all scholars and students, regular conference attendance is essential, and my experience at the Society for Cinema and Media Studies (SCMS) conference this spring further informed my chapter and served as an outlet to discuss my project in both formal and informal conversations. Scheduling as many of my essential visits as early as I could (at the beginning of the fellowship) was necessary, since finding a time that worked for everyone was often more logistically difficult than expected. Knowing that the work I did this semester would have been in a word, <i>impossible</i>, with a full-time graduate teaching schedule at the University of Maryland has made me value the research that has come out of this semester. The research has shaped the entirety of this chapter and it has provided me with a rich trove or research material I will continue to mine in the future. To manage my <i>time</i>, the resource the fellowship afforded me this semester, scheduling long-term (week by week for the semester) and short term (daily &amp; weekly writing goals and reading deadlines), while consistently sticking to these strict, self-imposed deadlines served as a crucial mechanism of self-accountability.</p>\n\n<p class=\"p1\">Much of my own work attempts to speak to the hidden roles of <i>containers</i> as information storage objects and their placement within larger infrastructures—the containerization of information surrounds us, bundling together documents in boxes and binding together bits and bytes whirring on hard drives. In this same vein, I hope that this post helps to demystify the process of dissertation chapter writing. In the past four months I have written a full dissertation chapter (the second of four chapters)—writing this chapter and reflecting upon my experience has helped me come to a great many realizations about my own writing style, how to overcome perceived writing limitations, and putting these understandings into practice. My hope is that these humble suggestions will help out another dissertating PhD candidate and provide them with some support during a time that is often a rich time of learning from others, but when writing can feel very solitary. Yet, this is a position that most scholars have previously gone through, which deepened their understanding of their research projects, and helped formed the intellectual foundation of future job applications, book projects, and meaningful careers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"p1\">Many excellent resources exist, among those let me suggest Joan Bolker’s <i>Writing Your Dissertation in Fifteen Minutes a Day</i> as a helpful, practical aid that is worth checking out from your local library. I would also like to thank everyone who made this possible: Trevor Muñoz, Purdom Lindblad, Ed Summers, Stephanie Sapienza, Raffaele Viglianti, Grace Babukiika, and Ricky Punzalan for their wonderful support at MITH and the iSchool. I would like to thank my entire committee for their support of my project for this fellowship, and I would like to thank the many librarians, archivists, faculty, and private industry workers who were willing to take the time out of their day to discuss my project and their professional insights to it.</p>\n\n[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][fusion_builder_column type=\"1_1\" layout=\"1_1\" background_position=\"left top\" background_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" border_color=\"\" border_style=\"solid\" border_position=\"all\" spacing=\"yes\" background_image=\"\" background_repeat=\"no-repeat\" padding_top=\"\" padding_right=\"\" padding_bottom=\"\" padding_left=\"\" margin_top=\"0px\" margin_bottom=\"0px\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_direction=\"left\" hide_on_mobile=\"small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility\" center_content=\"no\" last=\"no\" min_height=\"\" hover_type=\"none\" link=\"\"][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]",

Understanding what the videogame industry itself is doing with the concept art, tools, and other records they create is an important step to ensure that these increasingly important artifacts are preserved for future generations. In this talk, Rachel Donahue, doctoral student at the iSchool, will discuss her findings from a preliminary survey of videogame industry (and player community) preservation and records management practices.\n\nRACHEL DONAHUE is a doctoral student at the University of Maryland's iSchool, researching the preservation of complex, interactive digital objects.  She received a BA in English and Illustration from Juniata College in 2004, and an MLS with a specialization in archival science from UMD in 2009. Rachel is a Research Assistant at the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities, currently supporting the Preserving Virtual Worlds and Computer Forensics and Born-Digital Content in Cultural Heritage Collections projects. Additionally, she supports the research and communications activities of the National Archives and Records Administration's Center for Advanced Systems and Technology.\n\nComing up @MITH 9/29: Zita Nunes (English &amp; Comparative Literature), &quot;The Harlem Renaissance in Second Life&quot;\n\nView MITH's complete Digital Dialogues schedule here:\n\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20100608230933/http://www.mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_fall_2009.pdf\n\nAll talks free and open to the public!\n\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-8927).",

Until recently, this has not been a\n\ndifficult question, but the creation of massive databases of digitized\n\ndocuments has begun to enable researchers to explore new\n\npossibilities. Text can be seen not just as words to be read but as\n\ndata to be measured. In this dialog, Mimno will present some examples of\n\nthe use of computational methods to analyze 100 years of journal\n\narticles from JStor. Mimno will then consider how to extend this case\n\nstudy to general practice. How can we empower scholars to formulate\n\nhypotheses and test them experimentally, all while maintaining\n\nappropriate caution and skepticism?\n\n\n\nThe talk will be held in the MITH Seminar Room, in the basement of McKeldin Library.\n\n\n\n<a href=\"http://www.cs.umass.edu/~mimno/\" target=\"_blank\">David Mimno</a> is a postdoctoral researcher in the Computer Science\n\ndepartment at Princeton University. His research is on data mining in\n\ntext collections, with a focus on computational approaches to the\n\nHumanities. As a graduate student at the University of Massachusetts,\n\nAmherst he wrote the topic modeling package in the <a href=\"http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">MALLET machine\n\nlearning toolkit</a>. Prior to graduate school, he was Head Programmer at\n\nthe <a href=\"http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/\" target=\"_blank\">Perseus Project</a> at Tufts University, where he designed and\n\nimplemented the current Perseus web interface (Hopper 4.0). David's\n\nwork is supported by a Digital Humanities Research grant from Google\n\nand a Computing Innovation fellowship from the National Science Foundation (NSF).\n\n\n\nComing up @MITH 10/04: Robert K.

    "wp post content": "Thanks to a group of wonderful instructors and an energetic, passionate cohort of students from around the world, the first iteration of our intensive digital humanities training institute was a great success when it was held in January 2013. We were inspired by the model pioneered at the Digital Humanities Summer Institute (DHSI) and we were responding to an unmet need we perceived for additional training opportunities—in new locations, with different but complementary courses and emphasis. Our first year was a true experiment.\n\nGiven the positive response from the community, we’re pleased to announce the continuation of our training event for a second year. We’re making a few changes as we develop but the core of what made the first institute great will remain: a slate of engaging courses taught by some of the best scholars and teachers in the digital humanities, plentiful opportunities to meet and network with colleagues, and access to all the cultural resources of the Washington, D.C., area.\n\nOne of the most obvious changes will be our name. The Digital Humanities Winter Institute is now Humanities Intensive Learning and Teaching (HILT).\n\nThis change in name accompanies a change in the timing of the event. The next iteration of HILT will be held at <strong>August 4-8, 2014</strong>, on the campus of the University of Maryland in College Park. We decided to change the dates based on feedback for our community of instructors and students. Summer will allow us to offer accommodation in campus housing and thus to lower the total cost of attendance. This was particularly important because we are committed to making excellent digital humanities instruction available to graduate students, alternative academics, cultural heritage professionals and anyone with limited travel or professional development funding. Helping bolster diversity in the digital humanities is an important goal of HILT. Look for more announcements about steps we are taking to address diversity.\n\nThe other element of our new identity as HILT is a sharpening of focus on providing excellent learning opportunities. We’re committed to keeping the size of courses to 20 students maximum and we’ll plan to offer only about 10 courses each year. The quality of our instructors and courses is something we’re keeping constant. We have another great roster and more courses are still being added. Full course descriptions will be made available later this summer. Confirmed instructors are:\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Adrianne Wadewitz</strong>, Wikipedia for Humanists and Cultural Heritage Professionals</li>\n\t<li><strong>Anastasia Salter</strong>, Teaching Through Games</li>\n\t<li><strong>Elijah Meeks</strong>, Network Analysis and Visualization</li>\n\t<li><strong>Jeremy Boggs</strong> and <strong>Jeri Wieringa</strong>, Introduction to Web Development, Design, and Principles: HTML5, CSS, and Javascript for beginners</li>\n\t<li><strong>Kam Woods</strong> and <strong>Porter Olsen</strong>, Born-Digital Forensics</li>\n\t<li><strong>Matt Jockers</strong>, Large Scale Text Analysis with R</li>\n\t<li><strong>Simon Appleford</strong> and <strong>Jennifer Guiliano</strong>, Project Development</li>\n\t<li><strong>Wayne Graham</strong> and <strong>Brandon Walsh</strong>, Humanities Programming with Ruby on Rails</li>\n</ul>\nWe’re very excited about continuing this training event. The community is truly what made the first institute a success so please mark your calendars and plan to join us:\n\n<strong>HILT</strong>\nHumanities Intensive Learning + Teaching\nAugust 4-8, 2014\n<a title=\"HILT\" href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/training\" target=\"_blank\">http://mith.umd.edu/training</a>\n@HILT_MITH\n\nApplications will open on <strong>October 1, 2013</strong>.\nWe look forward to seeing you there,\n\nJennifer Guiliano and Trevor Muñoz\n<em>Co-Directors, HILT</em>",

This one-year project has also produced an interactive interface and toolset for the detailed study of the quartos, with full-functionality applied to all\n\nthirty-two copies of one play, Hamlet, held at participating institutions.  Contributing content to this multi-institutional project are the Bodleian Library of the University of Oxford, the British Library, the University of Edinburgh Library, the Folger Shakespeare Library, the Huntington Library, and the National Library\n\nof Scotland. Textual encoding is provided by staff of the Oxford Digital Library of the University of Oxford. Programming and prototype design is undertaken by staff of the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities of the University of Maryland.  Now, three months from the conclusion of the grant, the production team will demonstrate the current state of the interface and seek advice and feedback to\n\nguide the completion of their work.\n\n\n\n----\n\nDOUG RESIDE is the Assistant Director of the Maryland Institute of Technology in the Humanities (MITH) and a Visiting Assistant Professor of Theater at the University of Maryland in College Park.  Doug holds undergraduate degrees in Computer Science and English and earned his PhD in English at the University of Kentucky where he worked on several digital humanities projects, including Kevin Kiernan's celebrated Electronic Boethius.  Doug's primary research interest is musical theater and the way in which digital technology can be used both to create and to preserve the art form.

Deena is an author and new media visionary who has been active in the creative electronic writing community nearly since its inception in the 1980s. In addition to being a writer and thinker, Deena has also been a collector and an amateur archivist (or, as we say of amateurs, a hoarder). Collecting and hoarding, it turns out, are very important activities, since too few of our cultural institutions and repositories are yet engaged with acquiring and saving the rich and various creative legacy we have inherited from the first generation of personal computing. The arrival of Deena's collection at MITH furnishes us with invaluable source material which will further both our in-house research in digital curation and preservation, as well as function as a primary resource for researchers interested in early hypertext and electronic literature.\r\r\n\r\r\nThis talk will introduce the collection to the MITH community, and discuss future research agendas. We intend a wide-ranging conversation, from the practicalities and ethics of preservation to the implications of born-digital material for textual and editorial theory.\r\r\n\r\r\nMATTHEW KIRSCHENBAUM is Associate Professor of English and Associate Director of MITH, as well as a Vice President of the Electronic Literature Organization. He has been lecturing widely this semester on \"The Remaking of Reading,\" a version of which just appeared in the Chronicle of Higher Education. His book, Mechanisms: New Media and the Forensic Imagination will be published in January by the MIT Press.\r\r\n\r\r\nJOHN MURRAY is currently pursuing a self-designed undergraduate major in digital narratives at the University of Maryland, having studied Digital Art and creative writing for two years at Towson University before transferring to College Park and studying computer science for a year. He is most interested in the authorial process, interactions and relationships between characters and readers and authors and the possibilities of digital fiction and narratives.\r\r\n\r\r\nComing up @MITH: This is the last Digital Dialogue of the semester. We'll have another full schedule next semester: speakers already confirmed include musician and poet ONI BUCHANAN, KEN PRICE (Nebraska), BERNIE FRISCHER (Virginia), and Maryland'S MARILEE LINDEMANN and JONATHAN AUERBACH.\r\r\n\r\r\nView MITH's complete Fall Speakers Schedule here:\r\r\n\r\r\n<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100615144449/http://www.mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_fall_2007.pdf\">http://www.mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_fall_2007.pdf</a>\r\r\n\r\r\nAll talks free and open to the public!\r\r\n\r\r\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-8927).",

Advocates champion the democratic nature of the collaboration. Critics decry the lack of provenance and thus trustworthiness of the information gathered in this way. Clearly, though, the technology and techniques can support both democratic collaboration and the collaboration of experts. Such technology and techniques offer an opportunity to advance the application of computing to teaching and research beyond the margins.\r\r\n\r\r\nDaniel Pitti is Associate Director of the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities (IATH) at the University of Virginia. Before coming to IATH in 1997, Pitti was Librarian for Advanced Technologies Projects at the University of California at Berkeley Library. Since 1993, Pitti has been the chief technical architect of Encoded Archival Description (EAD), an international standard for encoding library and archival finding based on XML. Pitti has a BA in religious studies from UC Davis, MA and C.Phil. in history of religions from UCLA, and an MLIS from UC Berkeley.\r\r\n\r\r\nComing up @MITH Oct. 17: SUSAN SCHREIBMAN (University Libraries), \"Beautiful Untrue Things: The Digital Dilemma.\" View the complete Fall 2006 schedule for Digital Dialogues here:<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100608224354/http://www.mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_fall_2006.pdf\"> http://www.mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_fall_2006.pdf</a>Free and open to the public.\r\r\n\r\r\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-5896).",

Dame is completing his dissertation, “Talk Amongst Yourselves: Community Formation in Transgender Counterpublic Discourse Online,” which explores the affective and structural meanings assigned to “community” in English-language transgender discourse online.\n\n\n\nDuring the fellowship, Dame will work on the second chapter of his dissertation, which focuses on the ideological meaning of “cisgender” and its role in shaping community sentiment in Usenet discourse. As part of this project, he will develop and launch an archive of posts from several major transgender-related newsgroups, held in the <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/usenethistorical\">Internet Archives’ Usenet Historical Collection</a>.\n\n\n\nUsing Critical and Multi-Modal Discourse Analysis, Dame analyzes how users past and present construct “transgender community” in discourse, and the impact of platform-specific affordances on these discussions. Each chapter draws on a different site, including <a href=\"https://www.digitaltransgenderarchive.net/catalog?f%5Bgenre_ssim%5D%5B%5D=Periodicals\">1990s movement publications</a>, archival data from Usenet newsgroups, ethnographic interviews with transgender-identified individuals, informational websites, <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15295036.2015.1130846?journalCode=rcsm20\">and Tumblr</a>. Throughout these different sites, he argues community’s use as a guiding heuristic, and the accompanying emphasis on the term’s positive affective associations, obscures key differences, disconnects, and inequalities amongst discourse participants.\n\n\n\nDame’s work tackles core Digital Humanities questions on the roles organizational architecture, metadata, and standardization play in guiding the flow and direction of discourse. His work and writings on the Transgender Usenet Archive also offers new methodological insights into working with early Usenet discourse in archival form. <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/people/person/avery-dame/\">You can read more about Avery on his MITH staff page here</a>.",

I don't have any trips planned except for Thanksgiving. I don't have  any activities outside work that take up a large amount of time. Nothing  is standing in my way.\n\n<img class=\"alignright\" title=\"hinkelstone_flickr\" src=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20111121183648/http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/hinkelstone_flickr-225x168.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"168\" />For those not familiar with <a href=\"http://www.nanowrimo.org/\" target=\"_blank\">NaNoWriMo</a>, head to the website and take a look. I want to explore why NaNoWriMo works and what it could mean for digital humanities.\n\nWhen  teaching creative writing, I have two weeks titled \"Editing without  writing\" and \"Writing without editing\" that cover sophistication and  voice.\n\nThis  is based on the idea that we have two competing forces that together  produce what we do: idea production and idea rejection. What isn't  produced can't be rejected. What isn't rejected is done. We can't write  what we don't come up with, but neither do we write what we reject. If  we're staring at a blank piece of paper, it's often because we are  rejecting what our mind is producing instead of accepting it.\n\nEditing  helps us survive. If we did everything we thought about and didn't  reject anything, we'd act as if we were drunk. That's why we do stupid  things when we're drunk. Alcohol turns off the editor.\n\nThis model is useful and matches well with my own experience. For more background that seems to support this model, read <em>Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking</em>. For now, let's assume that we need to turn off the editor if we want to let production flow.\n\nCrisis  does this. Judgment takes time. If we don't have time to think, then  we don't have time to judge. Baseball gives the batter a half-second or  less with the ball in the air. Since it takes almost half that time to  realize the ball's on its way, there's no time to think through options.  The batter's production side is tuned to create choices that don't need  winnowing.\n\nThis  is where we could do a post about neural networks and feedback loops.  Memorizing vocabulary doesn't train the production side of the brain.  Guided trial and error are best. Experts have been through about ten  thousand hours of this trial and error. After reading about neural  networks over twenty years ago, I gave up trying to memorize as a way of  internalizing. I just let my brain do the learning while I gave it  opportunities to correct itself.\n\nSophistication  is tightening prose, selecting better words, or removing clichés. Voice  is the result of our production. Voice comes through practice as we  teach our subconscious what is or isn't appropriate. It will never rise  to the level of sophistication. That's what editing is for. Voice is  what we have before we edit. Sophistication can come from a checklist of  things to look for because it rejects what has been written. If the  most frequent mistakes are avoided, the text might be publishable. This  is why we practice so much: to develop our voice so that after we've  rejected everything, there's still good stuff left over.\n\nNaNoWriMo  is all about writing stuff that we can reject later. Throwing us into a  crisis by making us write forces us to turn off our judgment and  commit to what comes to mind. The result is fifty thousand words of pure  voice. We don't have time to edit if we're going to write sixteen  hundred words a day.\n\nA  problem I see in DH is the tendency to edit too much before anything  can get done. People don't want to make mistakes. They may not know how  to program, feel in control of the computer, or know HTML and CSS.  Instead of trying something and learning from failure, they don't do  anything at all. They have the equivalent of writer's block.\n\nNo  one has to be a professional to participate in NaNoWriMo. No one should  have to be an accomplished programmer to get started in DH. They just  need the crisis that forces them to turn off their judgment and start  typing.\n\nWe  need a NaNoWriMo-like event for digital humanities. Take a month and  write a web-based project. It doesn't have to work well. You won't want  to read my novel at the end of November, but I can take time after  November to edit what I've written. Once a month has passed and the  project is starting to take its first shaky steps, the polishing can  begin.\n\nHow  much should be done in a month? We don't want this to be easy. The  whole point is to have no time to edit while writing. NaNoWriMo chose  fifty thousand words because it's an arbitrary number that is long  enough not to be a novella while still being reasonable. The DH  equivalent should be more than a tool, but not as large as the  blockbuster projects out there.\n\nIf  we assume about fifteen words per sentence on average, then we have  3,333 sentences in our NaNoWriMo novel. That's a little over a hundred  sentences a day.\n\nWe  can think of these as lines of code. As a professional programmer, I  can do a hundred lines of edited code a day if I know what I'm aiming  for, so expecting about three thousand lines of unpolished code in a  month isn't too far out there to be impossible. Having to write this  code on your own time may be enough to induce crisis, similar to what is  happening to me with my NaNoWriMo novel.\n\nWhat  about rules? Considering NaNoWriMo, no code should be written before  the event begins. Instead, things like planning, platform selection,  learning APIs, and sketching the look and feel can be done in  preparation. Use a framework that lets you focus on the things that are  important to your project, just as a novel writer selects a genre and  all of its expectations so they can focus on the important parts of the  story.\n\nYour  three thousand lines of code won't be publishable. You shouldn't test  or debug during the month of writing. That's editing and polishing.  Getting the code down forces you to think through all of the parts of  your project and how they might interact. In fact, you may want to start  over from scratch after the month. You'll have a much better picture of  what's going into your project.\n\nAnyone interested in trying this?",

    "wp post content": "I had originally planned to use this post  to log my adventures in desoldering the CPU from the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), but, alas, the campus couriers are holding the all-important <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desoldering#Desoldering_pump\">solder sucker</a> hostage.  Instead, I'll talk a little bit about the work we've done with the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES), which involves significantly less molten metal.\n\n\n\nOne goal of the <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/research/pvwii/\">Preserving Virtual Worlds 2</a> (PVW2) project is to provide videogame curators with information and tools to make their job easier.  One small but important step in any digital preservation workflow is auditing the files--making sure that the bitstream you have in your repository is the same as the bitstream on the original media (or, down the line, making sure that the bitstream in the repository is the same as the bitstream you originally ingested). This is sometimes referred to as an integrity check, and with files stored and accessed on ordinary media is a relatively trivial matter of calculating a <a href=\"http://www.iasa-web.org/tc04/integrity-and-checksums\">checksum</a> at ingest and  checking that the same number is still derived when the same algorithm is applied to the bitstream at regular intervals.  When data is being migrated into a new format, it is also wise to make sure nothing is lost when accessing the file in  the new format, which is why you'll find color strips in the toolkit of digitization QCers.\n\n\n\nWhen we migrate SNES games to a media neutral format, we're taking code that was originally burned into a read-only chip (ROM) and creating a digital file. We then access that digital file using a software emulator instead of proprietary hardware designed to do nothing but read those cartridges. This raises two questions:\n\n<ul>\n\n<ul>\n\n<ol type=\"1\">\n\n\t<li>How do we know that the file we save matches the file originally burned on the ROM?</li>\n\n\t<li>How do we know that the emulator is correctly interpreting the ROM?</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n</ul>\n\n</ul>\n\nTo answer these questions, we're using a nifty device called the <a href=\"http://www.retrode.org/about/\">Retrode2</a>.  The Retrode allows you to play SNES cartridges with original SNES controllers through an emulator on your computer. As a side effect, it also allows you to extract ROM files and savegames (SRAM) and to write new files to the SRAM. The following workflow is based on the assumption that\n\n<ul>\n\n<ul>\n\n<ol type=\"1\">\n\n\t<li>A ROM file which will read an original savegame  from an SNES cartridge is likely an accurate representation of the game.</li>\n\n\t<li>An emulator which produces a savegame which can be loaded by the game on the original cartridge likely presents an accurate representation of gameplay.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n</ul>\n\n</ul>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<h3>Setting up the Retrode2</h3>\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-blog-medium wp-image-9682\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/PVW2Retrode_boxcontents-320x202.jpg\" alt=\"Retrode2 device, miniUSB cord, instruction booklet\" width=\"320\" height=\"202\" />\n\n\n\nThe Retrode box contains the Retrode unit, a Mini-USB cable, and a simple sheet of instructions. SNES cartridges are inserted in the rear slot, facing backwards. Controllers are plugged into the side ports.\n\n\n\nBefore using the Retrode, it is necessary to flash the firmware (the firmware it ships with is known to have some errors with SNES controllers). The latest firmware, along with some basic instruction, are available <a href=\"http://www.retrode.org/documentation/firmware/\">here</a>. If you’re using Windows and have difficulty with FLIP, try running it as Administrator.\n\n\n\nOnce you’ve successfully updated the firmware and reset the device, open up the Retrode in a file manager. Note the datestamp--files on the Retrode will a<strong>lways</strong> display this datestamp, even if you have updated them (when the device has been reset after any file changes).\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-9684\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/retrode-explorer.png\" alt=\"File-listing for the Retrode2\" width=\"650\" height=\"170\" /></p>\n\nOpen the file <a href=\"http://www.retrode.org/documentation/the-retrode-cfg-file/\">RETRODE.CFG</a> in a text editor. Your filenames may include a number after the game title. If you’d like to disable this, change the value on <strong>line 15</strong> for <span style=\"font-family: Courier,monospace;\">[fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=\"yes\" overflow=\"visible\"][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=\"1_1\" background_position=\"left top\" background_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" border_color=\"\" border_style=\"solid\" spacing=\"yes\" background_image=\"\" background_repeat=\"no-repeat\" padding=\"\" margin_top=\"0px\" margin_bottom=\"0px\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_direction=\"left\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" center_content=\"no\" min_height=\"none\"][filenameChksum]</span> from <strong>1</strong> to <strong>0</strong>. In order to write savegames to the cartridge, it is also necessary to change the value for <span style=\"font-family: Courier,monospace;\">[sramReadonly]</span> on <strong>line 17</strong> from <strong>1</strong> to <strong>0</strong>. <em>Only</em> change this value if and when you are writing a savegame to the cartridge. Leaving it on provides some small security against accidentally corrupting your save file. Save. If for some reason saving the config file fails, refer to procedures for writing an SRAM (save) file  to the cartidge.\n\n<ol>\n\n\t<li>; Retrode .17g - Config</li>\n\n\t<li>; Remove any line to revert setting to factory default</li>\n\n\t<li>[HIDMode] 1 ; 0: Off; 1: 4Joy+Mouse; 2: 2Joy; 3: KB; 4: iCade</li>\n\n\t<li>; Hex codes for KB mode (in this order):</li>\n\n\t<li>; SNES gamepad: B Y SEL STA ^ v &lt; &gt; A X L R</li>\n\n\t<li>; In NES mode: A B SEL STA ^ v &lt; &gt; x x x x</li>\n\n\t<li>; SEGA gamepad: B A MOD STA ^ v &lt; &gt; C Y X Z</li>\n\n\t<li>; See usb.org/developers/devclass_docs/Hut1_11.pdf (pp.53ff)</li>\n\n\t<li>[kbL] 06 1b 28 2c 52 51 50 4f 09 07 04 16</li>\n\n\t<li>[kbR] 10 11 05 19 33 37 36 38 0e 0d 0a 0b</li>\n\n\t<li>[nesMode] 0 ; 1: NES gamepads; 0: SNES</li>\n\n\t<li>[filenameChksum] 0 ; checksum in filename? 0,1</li>\n\n\t<li>[detectionDelay] 5 ; how long to wait after cart insertion/removal</li>\n\n\t<li>[sramReadonly] 0 ; write protect SRAM?</li>\n\n\t<li>[segaSram16bit] 0 ; use 16bit words for SRAM?</li>\n\n\t<li>[sramExt] srm</li>\n\n\t<li>[snesRomExt] sfc</li>\n\n\t<li>[segaRomExt] bin</li>\n\n\t<li>; Override autodetect:</li>\n\n\t<li>[forceSystem] auto</li>\n\n\t<li>[forceSize] 0</li>\n\n\t<li>[forceMapper] 0</li>\n\n\t<li>; Optional plug-ins:</li>\n\n\t<li>[atariRomExt] a26</li>\n\n\t<li>[tg16RomExt] huc</li>\n\n\t<li>[vbRomExt] vbr</li>\n\n\t<li>[n64RomExt] n64</li>\n\n\t<li>[gbRomExt] gb</li>\n\n\t<li>[gbaRomExt] gba</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nHere it is, set up and running Super Mario Kart:\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-9683\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/mariokart-splash-707x980.jpg\" alt=\"Mario Kart running on an emulator through the Retrode2\" width=\"324\" height=\"450\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Setting up an Emulator</h3>\n\nSNES9x is an emulator available for all major platforms. To run it, simply extract the contents of the zipfile to a directory of your choice.\n\n\n\nThe SNES game pad must be setup as the input device within the emulator. To do this, select <strong>Input-&gt;Input Configuration</strong> in the top menu or press <strong>Alt+F7</strong>. Click your mouse in the “Up” textbox, and then press the corresponding buttons on the SNES controller until all buttons have (J0) or (J1) values. Ignore the  buttons after the R-button.\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-9681 size-full\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/snes9x-input.png\" alt=\"SNES9x's Input Configuration Screen\" width=\"514\" height=\"493\" /></p>\n\n<strong>Select File-&gt;Load Game</strong> or type <strong>Ctrl+O</strong> and navigate to the Retrode directory. Open the <strong>*.sfc</strong> file; opening the <strong>*.srm</strong> (save) file will just cause the emulator to hang. When you play the game, it should reflect any data currently stored in the cartridge’s SRAM. The *.sfc file can be copied to SNES9x’s <strong> Roms</strong> directory for later play without the Retrode.\n\n<h3>Extracting and Injecting Battery Saves</h3>\n\nTo extract a save file, simply copy the *.srm file to a local directory (for instance, SNES9x’s Saves directory).\n\n\n\nEnsure that <span style=\"font-family: Courier,monospace; font-size: 10pt;\">[sramReadonly]</span> on <strong>line 17</strong> is set to <strong>0</strong> in RETRODE.CFG. If you get “Access denied.” or a similar error message when attempting to inject a save, this value is set to 1.\n\n\n\nSome command-line work is necessary to inject a new savefile onto the SRAM. In Windows, type “<strong>cmd</strong>” in the Start Menu, right click the program that shows up, and select “Run as Administrator.” On other platforms, use the Terminal. Note the location of the NEW save file as well as the drive letter/location of the Retrode. The new save file must have the same name as the file you are replacing. Case is important. In this example we will be placing a new save file onto a Super Mario Kart cartridge. At the command line (in Windows), type:\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-family: Courier, monospace; font-size: 10pt;\">type C:PathtoNewSaveGame.srm &gt; D:SaveGame.srm</span>\n\n\n\nso, for Super Mario Kart\n\n<p style=\"background: cccccc; font-family: Courier,monospace; font-size: 10pt;\">type  Z:DocumentsMITHPVWSNESsnes9xSavesSuperMarioKart.srm &gt; D:SuperMarioKart.srm</p>\n\n on Mac/Linux you can either use\n\n<p style=\"background: cccccc; font-family: Courier,monospace; font-size: 10pt;\">cat /path/to/New/SaveGame.srm &gt; /path/to/SaveGame.srm</p>\n\nor\n\n<p style=\"background: cccccc; font-family: Courier,monospace; font-size: 10pt;\">dd if=/path/to/New/SaveGame.srm of=/path/to/SaveGame.srm</p>\n\n When you look at the Retrode in a file manager, the srm file should now reflect today’s date. After the Retrode has been reset, <em>even if you were successful</em>, the datestamp will revert to the standard 1990 date. To see if the transfer was successful, clear out any files in SNES9x’s Save directory (it has a tendency to privilege local save files) and open the *.sfc file from the Retrode. The game data should now reflect the new savegame rather than whatever was originally on the cartridge. The easiest way to check this in Super Mario Kart is to look at Time Trials.\n\n\n\nIf for some reason you get a CHKSUM error and SNES9x hangs, fear not! Playing the game with an original SNES console should fix the problem. This is most likely to happen if you use the OS’s GUI copy command rather than writing over the file at the command line.\n\n\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_9686\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"501\"]<img class=\"wp-image-9686 size-full\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/MK-battsave.png\" alt=\"Mario Kart Time Trial Data (Original Save)\" width=\"501\" height=\"428\" /> The save data originally on the cartridge.[/caption]\n\n\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_9685\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"504\"]<img class=\"wp-image-9685 size-full\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/MK-newbattsave.png\" alt=\"Mario Kart Time Trial Data (New Save)\" width=\"504\" height=\"424\" /> The new save data.[/caption]\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe drawback to this workflow is that it only works with SNES cartridges that support saving. It also depends on the battery which powers those saves being live, though it is easy to replace that battery with a little technical know-how. It does, however, give us a way to audit a fair subset of SNES games and it's a lot of fun![/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]",

I’ve recently come to appreciate even more Peter Mallios’ previous blog posts comparing the FLA project to a sea voyage, both in terms of the excitement it holds for potential discovery and in terms of the daily routine of rote, occasionally monotonous, activities that it takes to sail a ship…or build an online archive. It’s been a long few weeks at the scanning machine! Of course, there have been small but extremely rewarding discoveries along the way, and, as it did for Joseph Conrad, our time “at sea” has provided space for reflection. In this blog post, I’d like to share how the Modern British sub-team of the FLA project has remapped its goals and focus, as well as some of the questions and ideas that have come up on our journey.\n\nTo briefly fill-in anyone just joining the conversation, the FLA is a project that seeks to understand the significance of literature written by foreign authors in the United States. (For a more extensive description, you can check out the project information page<a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/research/fla\"> here</a>.) The Modern British archive is a sub-project focused on the reception of modern British authors. Joseph Conrad, who was born in Poland and eventually became a British citizen, is our first focus-writer. We began our work this past fall by organizing an enormous amount of print archival materials on the reception of Conrad that has been gathered by Peter Mallios and his students over the past several years. These materials covered the length of Conrad’s career and beyond, from contemporary reviews of Conrad’s first novel, Almayer’s Folly (1895), to personal reminiscences of individuals who met Conrad during his only trip to the U.S. in 1923 to reflections on the impact of his works written well after his death in 1924.\n\nOur original efforts were put into scanning as much of this material into an OCR-able format. However, after learning more about sentiment analysis and what it can potentially do, and also after reevaluating our initial resources, some of which consisted of copies that we found would not produce OCR-able scans, we decided to adopt a new strategy. We both narrowed our data set in terms of years and headed back to the library to gather more materials. We decided to focus on the latter half of Conrad’s career, beginning with the publication of Chance, which first appeared in serial form in 1912. It was published as a book in 1913 and became his greatest commercial success to-date and marked an important milestone in Conrad’s transition from the relative obscurity of his early career to the widespread popularity he enjoyed later. Our data set will extend to 1926 to include reviews of and references to the last published original collection of Conrad’s short stories, Tales of Hearsay (1926). We are particularly interested in understanding Conrad’s shift from a lesser known to a popular writer in the United States. We are further interested in how the specific group of women readers contributes to this shift. Our work will build on that of Susan Jones, whose groundbreaking Conrad and Women (1999) explores Conrad’s relationship to women, both in terms of women within his personal life and women as a set of readers that Conrad’s works engage and respond to. In contrast, our research will focus on women readers as reviewers, as writers who actively create an idea of Conrad within the public sphere.\n\nIn compiling our new data set, we have drawn on our own previously mentioned collection, tracking down alternative copies of any materials that cannot create scans readable by our OCR software. We’ve also used Theodore George Ehrsam’s A Bibliography of Joseph Conrad (1969) as a resource for identifying materials not already in our collection. We now have an extensive list of six hundred and fourteen articles to track down, which continues to grow. We’ve located many of these articles at the Library of Congress and the University of Maryland’s own libraries. Numerous original journals from the early twentieth-century are stored in off-campus shelving at UMD, and the staff at McKeldin Library has been a wonderful help in obtaining these materials. We’ve begun the scanning process, and, as of this week, we have roughly one hundred and sixty-six files scanned, comprising just over eighty articles, although some of the earliest scans produced from our initial materials may not be OCR-able. We have not yet finalized our sentiment analysis questions, but we anticipate that many of them will be similar to those used for the Russian Author Initiative. (While we belong to the same fleet, we’ve got a somewhat smaller crew, and we’re not quite as far along.)\n\nObviously, we still have an enormous amount of work to do. However, while standing at the scanner, it’s hard not to think forward to what this archive might some day look like, and what it might potentially do. Two issues in particular have occurred to me that we may need to delve into as we proceed. 1.) With both the Modern British archive and the Russian Author Initiative, we’ve considered the issue of how much supplementary material to provide users. On the one hand, such material would serve to allow users to understand what they read in context. On the other hand, scanning supplementary materials takes up resources, both in terms of time and storage space. One comprise we might consider would be to include within the site descriptions of the journals and newspapers our materials come from, including political affiliations. 2.) A fair amount of the reviews we have found are either unsigned or merely initialed. If we are serious about tracing the role of women reviewers in Conrad’s reception, we are going to have to come up with a method for tracking down these names. (Any suggestions readers of this blog may have as to how we can go about this, beyond Google, would be greatly appreciated!) Identifying these reviewers will be an additional step in our process, but could dramatically affect our results.\n\n<em>Jennifer Wellman will receive her Ph.D. in English Language and Literature from the University of Maryland in May 2012.

If in Italian Futurist poetry performance engages with the traditional conventions such as spatial distribution of elements on page that make the work a poem, in digital poetry performance becomes part of poetry making. Computer programming turns such poetry into interactive sites of encounter between authors, texts, and readers. In so doing, it invites speculation about the nature of poetry and generates debates on how digital spaces represent places where these identities meet, interact, and overlap. Moreover, the aspect of performance as spectacle and of digital poetry as scripted performance in particular, emphasizes a symbiotic relationship between digital poetry and its readers. This talk will approach performance through the lens of three interrelated aspects: as a technique of digital poetry creation; as spectacle; and as representation of cultural intersections. Theoretical considerations drawn from the work of Gianni Toti, Caterina Davinio, and Loss Pequeno Glazier will frame more general discussion of the poetry.\n\nMIRONA MAGEARU is a PhD Candidate in Comparative Literature at University of Maryland, College Park. She received her bachelor’s degree from The University of Bucharest, Romania, a Master's degree in communication from The National School of Political Studies, Bucharest, and another Master's degree in English from Emporia State University, Kansas. During her graduate studies she became fascinated with the power of computerized typography and explored the relationship between digital studies and rhetoric. Funded by a MITH dissertation fellowship in Spring 2010 she conducted archival research on video poetry at La Casa Totiana, Rome, and at The University of Pisa. She is currently working on her dissertation project, a comparative analysis which engages works produced by Loss Pequeno Glazier (a United States digital poet of Tejano origins) and Caterina Davinio, an Italian computer pioneer. This comparative study extends work on performance developed by theater and poetry theorists and uses its findings to investigate whether the performance of digital poetry opens up space for new and potentially more inclusive conceptions of identity.\n\nComing up @ MITH 4/27: Ray Siemens (Victoria), “Tool Mashing, The Devonshire MS (BL Add 17492) and its Networks”\n\nView MITH’s complete Digital Dialogues schedule here:\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20100608231200/http://www.mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_spring_2010.pdf\n\nAll talks are free and open to the public!\n\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-8927)",

As the book transitions from physical object to a licensed file cohabitating with other forms of media on an electronic device, we need to unpack the sense of permanence and cultural heft inherent in the physical form and figure out what exactly makes a book a book.\n\n\n\nI do not come to wallow in nostalgia nor lament the rise of ebooks, but to participate in a discussion about how the publishing industry (which has seen many technological disruptions to its business model) moves forward. Because books matter.\n\n\n\nThis talk will be held in the MITH Conference Room, in the basement of McKeldin Library.\n\n\n\nPeter Kay is the VP, Director of Digital Marketing and Strategy at W.W.

    "wp post content": "For the past six to seven months I have been leading the way for developing what we hope will be the first full blooded Foreign Literatures in America (FLA) archive based on receptions of Russian authors. While Peter Mallios has given Foreign Literatures in America its initial intellectual impetus, during the day to day research and archiving I have encountered innumerable small points of inquiry, seemingly mundane at first but then suddenly realized as potent obstacles to our research goals. Thus far and into the foreseeable future, no one hiccup in my process has crippled my efforts, but these moments raise questions the will ultimately enrich our archive and computational analysis in unexpected ways. For example, as the title of this entry suggests, the issue of names has raised a number of red flags. As one should expect, the transliteration of names from one alphabet into another is asking for trouble.\n\nLet me provide a concrete case: Фёдор Михайлович Достоевский, or perhaps better known to most readers here as Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky. That particular transliteration is, for the moment, only my personal convention that I have imposed on the project until we turn to the question of our own choice of spellings, which will likely undo all of my personal preferences. Even Wikipedia disagrees with me, spelling the author's name as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dostoevsky\" target=\"_blank\">Fyodor Mikhaylovich Dostoyevsky</a>. Ultimately the difference here seems inconsequential; I believe those two spellings are currently the most widely accepted. As a result, one might think that to find reception documents I would only need to enter into an archival database a text string like \"Dostoevsky\" OR \"Dostoyevsky\". If only it were so!\n\nFrom the eighty-three reception documents about Dostoevsky that I have so far acquired, we have seen a huge variance in the historical transliteration of the author's name. I will let some examples speak for themselves:\n\nDostoievksy\nDostojevski (from a review of an article in a Scandinavian periodical)\nDosteovsky (a misspelling?)\nDostoieffsky\nDostoevsky\nDostoyevsky\nDostoyefsky\nDostoievski\nDostoevskii\n\nThese are only a few of the variations that I have noted in passing during my research; as part of the digital analysis with which FLA is experimenting, we are painstakingly cataloguing spellings so that we may reflexively expand our research and analysis parameters. But from my own initial efforts, based on the examples that I have found and permutations that I have hypothesized, I have constructed an initial list of <strong>forty-five</strong> potential English spellings of the Russian writer's last name:\n\nDosteoffski\nDosteoffskii\nDosteoffsky\nDosteofski\nDosteofskii\nDosteofsky\nDosteovski\nDosteovskii\nDosteovsky\nDostoeffski\nDostoeffskii\nDostoeffsky\nDostoefski\nDostoefskii\nDostoefsky\nDostoevski\nDostoevskii\nDostoevsky\nDostoieffski\nDostoieffskii\nDostoieffsky\nDostoiefski\nDostoiefskii\nDostoiefsky\nDostoievski\nDostoievskii\nDostoievsky\nDostojeffski\nDostojeffskii\nDostojeffsky\nDostojefski\nDostojefskii\nDostojefsky\nDostojevski\nDostojevskii\nDostojevsky\nDostoyeffski\nDostoyeffskii\nDostoyeffsky\nDostoyefski\nDostoyefskii\nDostoyefsky\nDostoyevski\nDostoyevskii\nDostoyevsky\n\nThis ad hoc list is likely to grow, and the spellings of first names and patronymics will geometrically complicate it. Антон Павлович Че́хов, or Anton Pavlovich Chekhov, poses a similar though less diverse problem: the Cyrilic character \"Ч\" (like the Greek \"chi\") can be translitered as either \"Ch\" or \"Tch\". Thus, I have seen both Chekhov and Tchekhov. The name of another famous author, Лев Никола́евич Толсто́й or \"Leo\" Tolstoy, presents a contrast to Dostoevsky and Chekhov. Whereas in English we almost always see only either \"Tolstoy\" or \"Tolstoi,\" the awkward sounding \"Lev\" in Russian has been transformed in a number of ways into the English alphabet. To date, I have seen \"Lev,\" \"Leo,\" \"Lyof,\" and even a few \"Leons\" in a single issue of Craftsman in which both the names \"Leo Tolstoy\" and \"Leon Tolstoy\" appear.  While the names \"Dostoevsky\" and \"Chekhov\" are more singular signifiers, many figures with the name \"Tolstoy\" have circulated in the American cultural sphere: for example, Tolstoy's children and relatives on the one hand, and the Russian science fiction writer Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy on the other.\n\nEventually, with a full catalog at our disposal, we will be able to conduct the most expansive searches for and analyses of reception articles based on our Russian authors functions.  But, in addition, we now have to ask ourselves how might spelling variations inflect such reception?  I imagine that this question and its kin will require both sophisticated digital analysis and humanist attention as we continue onward.\n\nNick Slaughter is a first year PhD student in English at the University of Maryland.

    "wp post content": "Over the past few years, I've spent a good deal of time thinking about storytellers and storytelling. In fact, it was my interest in the work of the Polish author Joseph Conrad, who's Marlow is arguably one of the most widely recognized storytelling characters in twentieth-century literature, which started me on the path that eventually led to my involvement with the <em>Foreign Literatures in America</em> project. I've enjoyed reading the blog posts of my fellow FLA team members as they have offered some exciting paradigms for thinking about what we are attempting to accomplish and how we might proceed. Peter Mallios, our project leader, inspiringly <a title=\"Beginnings…\" href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/beginnings/\" target=\"_blank\">compared our work to that of maritime adventurers</a>; Rebecca Borden, my colleague from the Modern British collection, invoked the notion that our project should enable users to perform historical investigations on the microscopic level in her engaging post on <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/searching-for-the-quantum-dimension-of-foreign-literature/\" target=\"_blank\">\"Searching for the Quantum Dimensions of Foreign Literature.\"</a> As I reflect on what we have done so far, I would like to add yet another paradigm of comparison for thinking about our work designing a digital archive to trace the reception of foreign authors in America. As over the past several months, the FLA team has met on numerous occasions to discuss the parameters of this archive, I have increasingly become convinced of two points: 1) as digital archivists, we are storytellers of a sorts; and 2) it is fundamentally important to the efficacy of our project that we acknowledge ourselves as such.\n\nNow, to be clear, I don't mean that we are \"storytellers\" in terms of providing a traditional kind of narrative, with a beginning, middle, and end; but rather I am thinking of the ways that the decisions we make provide an interpretive framework through which our primary documents will be viewed and potentially understood by users. How will we organize the presentation of the reception materials we have collected? Should they be organized by genre (review, advertisement, letter to the editor, etc.)? By journal? By author? By author's nationality? Or should we create an interface that allows the user a choice between these arrangements? How will we make the materials searchable? Will we use keywords, and what keywords will we identify? Will we annotate the materials, and what will we annotate? What kind of contextual information will we provide? Decisions such as these must be made so that our site can be useable; yet they will inevitably affect how the materials we offer are read. Moreover, much like a literary canon, an archive itself creates a kind of narrative by virtue of the materials the archivist chooses to include or leave out. Over the past few months we have discussed questions such as what authors we should focus on first and whether we want to proceed by looking at their reception in a specific journal or in multiple journals across a given time period.\n\nThis all goes to my point in claiming the necessity of consciously thinking of ourselves and acknowledging our function as storytellers presenting the primary materials of the FLA collection in a particular manner. There is great power in a skilled storyteller's ability to communicate and to open a listener's mind to new experiences and perspectives. Indeed, part of the value of the \"story\" the FLA project offers – that is the \"story\" of the fundamental significance of foreign literature to American identity – comes from the fact that it is a previously unrecognized narrative. For this very reason, however, we must proceed cautiously and self-reflectively, making as much as possible our intentions and process clear and accessible to users. This means documenting and explaining why we have made particular editorial and organizational decisions. I also think that acknowledging ourselves as storytellers makes the inclusion of some kind of a platform for user input - a platform through which users can post comments, questions, critiques, additional materials, and potentially their own discoveries and research - all the more important. For, in the end, it doesn't seem to me that the \"story\" of foreign literatures in America is one that we can, or want, to tell on our own. It's a collaborative story, one that we hope to see grow from the resources we make available.\n\n<em>Jennifer Wellman is a Ph.D. Candidate in the University of Maryland English Department.

Mellon Foundation</a> will fund research, education and training at the intersections of digital humanities and African American studies at the University of Maryland. The grant will help to prepare a diverse community of scholars and students whose work will both broaden the reach of the digital humanities in African American history and cultural studies and enrich humanities research with new methods, archives and tools.\n\nThe grant, <em>Synergies among Digital Humanities and African American History and Culture: An integrated research and training model</em>, awarded to the <a href=\"https://www.arhu.umd.edu/\">College of Arts and Humanities (ARHU)</a> and co-directed by the <a href=\"http://arhusynergy.umd.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Arts and Humanities Center for Synergy (Center for Synergy)</a> and the <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH)</a>, will support a faculty project director, postdoctoral fellows, graduate students and staff in ARHU and the University Libraries. It also includes money to run workshops, to deliver public programming, to digitize materials from significant archival collections, to support faculty research and to integrate digital work into a number of innovative undergraduate curricular initiatives including UMD’s <a href=\"http://fire.umd.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">First-Year Innovation &amp; Research Experience (FIRE)</a> program, a new initiative to expose first-year undergraduates to rich research experiences, mentorship and social activities that are known to impact academic success.\n\n“UMD's project enhances the role of digital tools in African American studies, as well as the contributions of the field to digital discourse while also making a commitment to widening the reach of the digital humanities both within academic communities and outside the walls of the university,” said <a href=\"https://mellon.org/about/staff/mariet-westermann/\">Mariët Westermann</a>, vice president of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.\n\nThe College of Arts and Humanities has made serious investments in digital humanities and African American culture and history, hiring faculty clusters in both <a href=\"https://www.arhu.umd.edu/news/spotlight-2010-2011-new-faculty-appointments\">digital humanities</a> and <a href=\"https://www.arhu.umd.edu/news/2014-15-new-faculty-appointments\">African American literature and history</a>, adding to the strong community of digital humanist and African Americanist scholars already spread across the campus’s many colleges.\n\n“This venture could not be more timely or important,” said University of Maryland President <a href=\"http://www.president.umd.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Wallace D. Loh</a>. “It builds on our vital strengths in the humanities, increasing access to important source material on race and culture in America, while creating a new generation of technology-savvy researchers.”\n\nThe thematic focus of the project, African American labor, migration and artistic expression, incorporates the broad intellectual interests shared by a large group of prominent scholars, students and staff on campus, and represents some of the campus’s greatest strengths. Specific research projects will be undertaken in collaboration with <a href=\"http://newamerica.umd.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">The Center for the History of the New America</a>, which houses the Archive of Immigrant Voices; <a href=\"http://www.driskellcenter.umd.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">The David C. Driskell Center for the Study of Visual Art and Culture of African Americans and the African Diaspora</a> with its collection of over 50,000 objects that chronicle the development and understanding of the study of African American visual culture; and the UMD libraries’ recently acquired <a href=\"http://www.lib.umd.edu/special/collections/afl-cio\" target=\"_blank\">George Meany Memorial AFL-CIO Archive</a>, a preeminent research collection for the study of American labor history.\n\nAt UMD, digital humanities as a recognized field can be traced back to the founding of MITH in 1999, which has grown to international acclaim due to its transformational research at the intersection of technology and humanistic inquiry. The project will apply MITH’s innovative digital humanities incubator model to introduce scholars, students and cultural heritage professionals to new modes of research through a series of workshops, tutorials and detailed consultations. Strong in traditional arts and humanities fields as well, the university is also home to the Center for Synergy, the new humanities center at Maryland, which will provide an interdisciplinary bridge between departments and centers and facilitate the public facing events, curricular initiatives and websites connected with the project.\n\n“This ambitious project enables scholars in the region to leverage the remarkable resources we have on campus,” said <a href=\"https://www.umdrightnow.umd.edu/expert/bonnie-thornton-dill\">Bonnie Thornton Dill</a>, professor of <a href=\"http://wmst.umd.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Women’s Studies</a>, dean of the College of Arts and Humanities, and principal investigator of the Mellon grant. “To explore the histories of the African American population in the U.S., scholars will work with the rich and diverse data sets and archives found in these interdisciplinary centers.”\n\nThese resources together offer a new lens and framework for thinking and teaching about Black life in America, specifically investigating the way in which migration has shaped the history of Black people, as both forced and free laborers, and linking those experiences to visual and material culture.\n\n“Students and faculty researchers might investigate questions about labor activism among Caribbean Americans or explore visual representations of work as they examine the relationship of Black artists and the labor movement,” Ms. Thornton Dill said.\n\nFor more information, visit the College of Arts and Humanities <a href=\"https://www.arhu.umd.edu/news/125-million-mellon-grant-awarded-umd%E2%80%99s-arts-and-humanities-college\">website</a>.",

Since 1996, the Archive has been collecting bi-monthly snapshots of the World Wide Web\"“the entire Web\"“resulting in a cumulative collection of approximately 100 billion Web pages.  This cumulative historical record can be browsed and viewed using the Wayback Machine, an access interface developed by the Internet Archive (www.archive.org.) The Archive has since expanded its activities to include book scanning, audio collections, video and still image collections and Open Education Resources (videotaped lectures for entire college-level courses and the supporting materials.)  These collections comprise over two petabytes of data, stored in the Archive's Digital Repository in San Francisco.  The Internet Archive is active in the open-source software community and has developed several widely used tools for web harvesting, search, and management of clustered storage environments.  The Archive is dedicated to open source principles; accordingly all software used and developed by the Internet Archive is open source and open access. As an active technology partner in the academic, library and research communities, the Archive has become both a storage partner and content source for educators and researchers.  Its role as a unifier of open access content sources is growing through collaborative projects in book scanning and access, large collections of imagery and other content formats, as well as its roles as administrator of the Open Content Alliance (www.opencontentalliance.org) and as a co-founder of the International Internet Preservation Consortium (www.iipc.org.)\r\n\r\nThe Archive is engaging in several projects that can directly serve educators and researchers in the Digital Humanities community.  In this talk, LINDA FRUEH will describe the collections, projects and capabilities of the Internet Archive, and hopes to generate lively discussion in how the Archive can work to better support the conduct of Digital Humanities studies.\r\n\r\nMs. FRUEH is a Director at the Internet Archive, one of the world's largest online digital libraries.  At the Archive she manages the development of large partnerships and collaborative projects, coordinates activities of the Open Content Alliance, and manages grant writing for large projects. Ms. FRUEH joined the Archive after a sixteen-year career with technology companies in Silicon Valley.  Her previous positions included Vice President for Corporate Business Development at Lexar Media, Inc., Vice President for Strategic Planning at Network General, Inc., and Corporate Planning Director at the Raychem Corporation.  In these roles she led strategic planning activity, investments, mergers and acquisitions.  She started her career on Wall Street with the First Boston Corporation. Ms. FRUEH holds an MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business (1987) and a BS in physics from MIT.\r\n\r\nComing up @MITH: December, MATTHEW KIRSHCENBAUM and JOHN MURRAY, \"Save As: Receiving the Larsen Collection.\"\r\n\r\nView MITH's complete Fall Speakers Schedule here:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100615144449/http://www.mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_fall_2007.pdf\"></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100615144449/http://www.mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_fall_2007.pdf\">http://www.mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_fall_2007.pdf</a>\r\n\r\nAll talks free and open to the public!\r\n\r\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-8927).",

This one-day event will take place Saturday, November 3, 2012 from 9 am to 5 pm on the campus of the University of Maryland.\n\nTopic Modeling for Humanities Research will be a unique opportunity for cross-fertilization, information exchange, and collaboration between and among humanities scholars and researchers in natural language processing on the subject of topic modeling applications and methods. The workshop will be organized into three primary areas: 1) an overview of how topic modeling is currently being used in the humanities; 2) an inventory of topic modeling methods that have particular relevance for humanities research questions; and 3) a discussion of software implementations, toolkits, and applications. The workshop is designed to foster collaboration between these communities by providing humanities scholars with a deeper understanding of latent variable modeling methods (and best practices for their interpretation), and by articulating fundamental literary and historical questions for researchers outside of the humanities who are developing the models and methods. The organizers encourage applications from faculty, staff, and graduate students, as well as other academics and members of the general public with a serious interest in natural language processing, topic modeling, and the literary and historical questions that intersect with these research areas. Confirmed speakers include: Matthew Jockers of the University of Nebraska, David Mimno of Princeton University, Rob Nelson of the University of Richmond, Jordan Boyd-Graber of the University of Maryland, and more.\n\nTo apply to attend the Topic Modeling Workshop, please visit here.

    "wp post content": "My job is actually pretty simple. When people ask me what I do, I tell them I’m an English professor who teaches archivists about computers. What’s not to understand?\n\n\n\nOkay, there’s more to it than that. The official story is that I’m an <a href=\"http://www.english.umd.edu/users/mgk\" target=\"_blank\">Associate Professor of English</a> who also has a research and administrative role at a digital humanities center, the <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/\">Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities</a> at the University of Maryland. But that’s arguably even less illuminating.\n\nLet me try a third tack. Here’s a picture of my office. Apologies for the mess, I’m actually kind of a neat freak, but this is an interesting mess. Maybe one way to talk about what I do is just to walk you through it.\n\n\n\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-12722 size-full\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/blog_mattoffice.jpg\" alt=\"Matt's Office\" width=\"450\" height=\"336\" />\n\n\n\nSo, we’ll start over on the left-hand side. That’s an Apple IIe, my first machine. My parents bought it for me (yeah, I was that lucky) back around 1982-3. It still boots today. Among other things, I keep it around to show students. Most of them have never used a computer that didn’t have a hard drive, so first having to select a disk and pop it into the drive before the computer does anything is a new experience for them. It’s signed by two people I have enormous respect for, Bruce Sterling (famous for, among much else, the <a href=\"http://www.deadmedia.org/\">Dead Media</a> project) and <a href=\"http://ascii.textfiles.com/\">Jason Scott</a>, aka @textfiles. Both of them have been here to give talks, but the signatures also reinforce the way individual pieces of hardware become artifacts in their own right, something we’ve attempted to document in <a title=\"MITH’s Vintage Computers\" href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/research/miths-vintage-computers/\">a more formal way</a>. This computer, along with some Commodore 64s that Doug Reside used to keep around MITH when he was here, became the impetus for other people to begin offering us machines to add to our vintage collection.\n\n\n\nWhich brings us to the next machine over, an Osborne “portable,” which came into the shop in exactly that fashion. A friend--\n\n\n\n<em>Okay, not kidding, I was just this moment interrupted by a staffer from university relations who wanted to record an interview about <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/\">Steve Jobs</a>. We chatted about my early experiences using the Apple technology and he recorded video and audio of the old Disk II unit spinning up.</em>\n\n\n\nAnyway, the Osborne came to us courtesy of a friend in another library department who knew of MITH’s interest in vintage machines. As we’ve gotten more and more offers like this we’ve realized the importance of developing something like a collections policy, so that we’re not taking in lots of equipment we don’t really have any use for. The Osborne, though, is a real prize, and it too starts right up, though I was initially stymied by the fact that it wanted to boot from its B drive and I had to do a little online research to change the configuration settings. One thing I always impress upon my students when I co-teach (with Duke’s Naomi Nelson) the <a href=\"http://www.rarebookschool.org/courses/libraries/l95/\">Born-Digital course at Rare Book School</a> is the extent of the knowledge base that exists online in the computer enthusiast community.\n\n\n\nDirectly above the Osborne is a foam-board reproduction of a newspaper clipping. This in fact is the story and photograph that inspired Michael Joyce’s <em><a href=\"http://www.eastgate.com/catalog/Afternoon.html\">Afternoon</a></em>, widely regarded as the first full-length piece of hypertext fiction (it was first released back in 1987). The original is in the collections at the Harry Ransom Center, where Joyce’s literary papers are on deposit. The “papers,” however, also consist of born-digital materials, including several laptops and several hundred diskettes. This image is a reminder of the complex relationships that emerge around <a href=\"http://www.neh.gov/ODH/Default.aspx?tabid=111&amp;id=37\">hybrid digital/analog collections</a>, something I wrote about extensively in my first book, <em><a href=\"http://mechanisms-book.blogspot.com/\">Mechanisms</a></em>.\n\n\n\nThe small wooden box in the background next to the Osborne? That’s an omnibus edition of Oregon Trail, one of the games in our case set as part of the <a href=\"http://www.lis.illinois.edu/articles/2010/09/preserving-virtual-worlds-ii-awarded-more-750000-imls\">Preserving Virtual Worlds II</a> project. This is a multi-institutional effort funded by the IMLS that includes the University of Illinois, Stanford, RIT, and MITH at Maryland; we’re attempting to establishes a methodology for evaluating the “significant properties” of games and complex virtual objects, something we expect to become increasingly important to collecting institutions.\n\n\n\nNow we get to some really interesting stuff. The old Sun tower that you see is there as a power supply for the 5 ¼” floppy disk drive sitting on top of it. This drive is what I use to create “images” of data stored on old magnetic media. As Jason Scott has <a href=\"http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/3191\">powerfully stated</a>, it may well already be too late for much of this generation of computer history, as the floppies are already well past their expected lifespan. But using a floppy disk controller like the <a href=\"http://www.deviceside.com/fc5025.html\">FC5025</a> or the Software Preservation Society’s <a href=\"http://www.kryoflux.com/\">KryoFlux</a> (which just arrived the other day), I’m able to tether the floppy drive to my current laptop and image the disk as a bitstream representation of the original data. The disk image can then be used as the basis for extracting individual files, or it can be loaded into an emulator. Right now I’m working my way through my stockpile of personal diskettes from the Apple IIe. We’ve also used the FC5025 to image materials for the Preserving Virtual Worlds work. What’s interesting about the floppy controller technology is that it represents a grassroots effort outside of formal academic or collecting institutions, something my colleague Kari Kraus has <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/07/opinion/sunday/when-data-disappears.html\">written about compellingly</a>.\n\n\n\nBy the way, the blue box in the background behind the Sun tower is a Maxell Optical disk cartridge, a gift from Jason Scott. Visually it resembles a greatly enlarged 3.5” disk, and at <a href=\"http://www.rarebookschool.org/courses/libraries/l95/\">Rare Book School</a> I carry it on the first morning so our students will be able to tell our class from, say, the descriptive bibliography crew.\n\n\n\nWhich is one way of bringing me back to my vocation as a professor of English. Having been privileged enough to grow up with a piece of technology like the IIe, I’ve <a href=\"http://chronicle.com/article/Hello-Worlds/5476\">never really recognized</a> the “two cultures” divide that supposedly separates the humanities from technology. I’d spend an afternoon reading a novel and then that evening hacking my way through an Infocom text adventure—or maybe even making a ham-handed attempt to program one of my own. My interest in digital preservation, however, comes from the realization, largely a product of the <a href=\"http://www.iath.virginia.edu/\">intellectual culture</a> at the University of Virginia where I did my graduate work, that computers, like old books, are rich and multi-faceted objects, with their own unique stories to tell. <a href=\"http://bitcurator.net/\">Digital forensics</a> thus becomes the analog to a vocation like descriptive bibliography, one that focuses obsessively on the material characteristics of its object of study. Already it’s obvious that anyone interested in a writer or other public figure from the 1980s forward will likely find themselves working with born-digital material of one sort or another as part of that individual’s cultural legacy. I see my work as a kind of descriptive bibliography for the 21<sup>st</sup> century, bringing the kind of sensibilities we’ve cultivated with regard to books and other printed matter to bear on the objects and artifacts of our digital cultural inheritance.\n\n\n\n<a href=\"http://vimeo.com/28006483\">There</a>. Does that make sense now?\n\n\n\n--<a href=\"http://mkirschenbaum.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Matthew Kirschenbaum</a>\n\n\n\n<em>editor's note: </em>this post <a href=\"http://dayofdigitalarchives.blogspot.com/2011/10/english-professor-among-archivists.html\" target=\"_blank\">originally appeared</a> at dayofdigitalarchives.blogspot.com on October 6, 2011.",

But, while Wikipedia was born online, many of the ideas that inform its composition have long histories. Human beings have strived to give order to knowledge in the face of worries about information overload for ages. Their various responses have been shaped by the cultural norms, social needs, and technological possibilities of their historical contexts. This talk will focus on the old media precedents for Wikipedia's new media success story to explore what reciprocal relationships they reveal between concepts like knowledge and information and the technologies we design to build and distribute them.\n\nThis talk will be held in the MITH Conference Room, in the basement of McKeldin Library.\n\nMelanie Kill is an assistant professor of English at the University of Maryland, College Park. Her scholarship is in rhetorical genre theory, digital rhetorics, and critical discourse analysis, with specific interests in genre change in new media, the concept of uptake, and innovative rhetorics. She is currently at work on a book entitled, <em>The Last Encyclopedia: Wikipedia and the Networking of Human Knowledge</em>.

A field once dominated by Storyspace fiction now includes in its purview a wide variety of approaches to literary expression made for the computer and the network, including kinetic poetry, interactive fiction, combinatory writing, story and poetry generation, and network-mediated memoir.

    "wp post content": "It might seem strange to be talking about \"beginnings\" just as the semester is winding down, but that's exactly where I'm at: taking my very first step toward setting up the <em><a href=\"http://www.blackgothamarchive.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Black Gotham Digital Archive</a></em>.\n\nI had my first training session with Seth Denbo and Amanda Visconti last week, with Kirsten Keister joining us at the end. MITH is using Omeka as the platform on which to build my archive. Seth started off by explaining that Omeka relies on a \"vocabulary\" known as the Dublin Core through which I'm to enter my \"data\" and \"metadata.\" Huh? To me, these were entirely new, and quite daunting, terms until I realized how easily I could translate them into more familiar words. For you Humanities types out there, data is the written text (print or manuscript) to be displayed, and metadata is its footnote. Or if the data is an image, then the metadata is the credit line. So far, so good!\n\nI had only one horrifying moment. We selected an image of the Colored Orphan Asylum as a test case, entered the metadata, and then uploaded the image. It worked beautifully! Buoyed by my success, I decided to upload a second image. Inexplicably, my laptop started to shake and groan. I was convinced it was about to explode, and so of course I started to shake and groan as well. Seth and Amanda thought it was pretty funny but when they admitted that they had never seen (or heard) this happen before, I was close to a meltdown. Sensing my pain, they fetched Kirsten, the Omeka guru, but she too was baffled. A conversation ensued in a language I found utterly incomprehensible and untranslatable, so I tuned out and relaxed for a few minutes. The upshot is that they're going to investigate the problem and then let me know what I should do.\n\nDespite this little <em>contretemps</em>, the session did succeed in teaching me the mechanics of entering data and metadata. But as I left, I returned to the question of <em>what</em> I'm trying to accomplish and <em>why</em>. I needed to start thinking again.\n\nAt my talk at the Massachusetts Historical Society, staff member Jayne Gordon asked why I had chosen to structure my book around the geography of New York City, suggesting that I could surely have chosen other ways of narrating my story. My first response was to reiterate a point I've made many times: that in contrast to the Harlem model of the first half of the twentieth-century, where neighborhood and community were co-extensive, nineteenth-century black New Yorkers lived throughout the entire city, in different wards and neighborhoods. The result was that they came into contact with a wide range of the city's white inhabitants in a variety of interactions, some predictable, some not. I then added that I thought geography mattered because place also seemed to offer black New Yorkers a profound sense of identity. They insisted over and over again that they were citizens of Gotham—a term coined for New York by Washington Irving in 1807—and repeatedly proclaimed their identity as Gothamites.\n\nAs I continued talking, it struck me that I might have had a more personal motivation for grounding my story in place, that I might have been drawn subconsciously to the striking differences between my ancestors' sense of place and my own. In an autobiographical essay titled \"Notes of a Native Daughter: Reflections on Identity and Writing\" (in <em>Autobiographical Writing across the Disciplines</em>, Duke University Press, 2003), I described how my father's work with international public health organizations took my family abroad from 1950 through the early 1960s; I lived outside the United States from about age five to eighteen, first in Beirut, Lebanon for almost three years and then in Geneva, Switzerland for almost ten. As a result, I knew very little about my own country. My parents made sure to tell my sisters and me about the many accomplishments of African American men and women—from George Washington Carver and Charles Drew to Jackie Robinson and Althea Gibson—and used <em>Time</em> magazine articles featuring the students who integrated the Little Rock High School and lunch counters throughout southern towns as well as Martin Luther King Jr.'s emergence as a race leader as lessons to teach us about U.S. race relations. I listened carefully to these stories of amazing courage, but knew that these experiences were not mine.\n\nCompounding this problem was the fact that my parents said little about their own family past. As I detail in the Prologue of <em>Black Gotham</em>, my father never told us that his ancestors had come from England and Haiti in the first decades of the nineteenth century to settle in New York and become part of the city's black cultural elite. And my mother never told us how her mother had left her family and native island of Jamaica in the early twentieth century to come to the United States with her daughter in search of a better life.\n\nInstead, my parents tried to impart to my sisters and me their deep ecumenical conviction—so prevalent in the United Nations and its international agencies in those postwar years—that all nations and races constitute one universal family. That might have been fine in theory, but it didn't work in practice since I was well aware of the gulf that separated me from the Swiss: I was African descended, not European; English, not French, was my first language; my friends ate cheese and <em>marmite</em> while I devoured hamburgers and peanut jelly sandwiches.\n\nI can best capture my sense of unbelonging through a visit James Baldwin made unannounced to our home in Geneva in the fall of 1953. He was not yet the famous writer he would eventually become and my family had no idea who he was. It was only years later when I returned to the States for college that I realized that our visitor had been the now famous writer and that at the time he was on his way back to visit the Swiss village in the mountains depicted in \"Stranger in the Village.\" I remember reading the essay with intense interest, focusing in particular on Baldwin's comments about the extent to which the Swiss villagers felt so firmly rooted in place, secure in their belief that they belonged to the village (or perhaps that the village belonged to them), and his awareness of how this rootedness reflected their sense of shared nationality, culture, and race. Baldwin, the villagers made clear, did not belong; they regarded him \"not only as a stranger in their village but as a suspect latecomer, bearing no credentials, to everything they have—however unconsciously—inherited.\"\n\nIn Baldwin I had finally found a writer who summarized with uncanny accuracy my own uneasy sense of not belonging to a village, of not being rooted in place. I felt that I belonged neither to Switzerland nor to the United States, and that neither Switzerland nor the United States (at least in the early years of my return) claimed me as one of their own. No wonder that in writing <em>Black Gotham</em> I found myself drawn to my ancestors' conviction that they were Gothamites despite the fact that the city (and the nation) had done their utmost to reject them as \"strangers in their village\" and \"suspect latecomers,\" unfit to vote, to attend their schools and churches, and even to walk down their streets. Through them I found my sense of belonging. Now I can wander through the streets of New York City and think triumphantly to myself: \"I belong!\"\n\nIn retrospect, I'm convinced that I wrote <em>Black Gotham</em> to capture this sense of rootedness in place. I now wonder whether the methodological shift I'm performing in the <em>Black Gotham Digital Archive</em> won't offer me an even more compelling way of achieving my goal. My training session last week made me realize just how my digital archive inverts the relationship between word and image (consisting in large part of place—maps, streets, and buildings). In my book, word was the primary vehicle for telling my story and image functioned as supporting illustration; in the digital archive, image is the primary vehicle and word supporting document. Maybe I'm on my way to answering my question: <a href=\"http://www.blackgothamarchive.org/blog/what%E2%80%99s-the-virtue-of-virtuality/\">\"What's the Virtue of Virtuality?\"</a>\n\n<em>Editor's note</em>: Carla L.

Kindle, Nook, iPhone . . . after 2000 years, the codex is getting an upgrade. But what kind of electronic books and electronic reading devices do we really want? Are we trying to improve on the book, or create something new? Something different? Are there some universal design principles we can agree on? And what about the bigger picture: can electronic gadgetry reverse the national decline in reading dramatically documented by agencies such as the NEA? This roundtable discussion led by Ben Bederson, Nick Chen, and Matt Kirschenbaum will feature as many electronic reading and electronic book devices as we can lay our hands on, including some prototypes being developed here at the University of Maryland. We&apos;ll hold them up, pass them around, turn them on, talk some trash, and, in the process, maybe gain just a little bit of insight into what we all want from our electronic book readers. Attendees are encouraged to bring along electronic book devices of their own.\n\n\n\nBenjamin B. Bederson is an Associate Professor of Computer Science and the previous director of the Human-Computer Interaction Lab at the Institute for Advanced Computer Studies and iSchool at the University of Maryland. His research is on mobile device interfaces, information visualization, interaction strategies, digital libraries, and accessibility issues such as voting system usability. He is also co-founder and Chief Scientist of Zumobi, a startup offering a mobile content platform based on that research.\n\n\n\nNicholas Chen is a doctoral candidate in the department of Computer Science at the University of Maryland and is affiliated with the Human Computer Interaction Lab (HCIL) at UMD. He is advised by Professor Francois Guimbretiere in the Cornell University Information Science Department. His research is on electronic reading devices, pen-based user interfaces, and interactions for supporting simultaneous use of multiple devices. Previously, he performed the first-ever evaluation of a dual-display electronic reading device.\n\n\n\nMatthew G. Kirschenbaum is Associate Professor in the Department of English at the University of Maryland, Associate Director of the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH), and Director of Digital Cultures and Creativity, a new &quot;living/learning&quot; program in the Honors College.\n\n\n\nComint up @ MITH 11/11: Greg Crane, &quot;From the First Year Through Tenure: New Pathways for Humanities in a Digital Age&quot;\n\n\n\nView MITH&apos;s complete Digital Dialogues schedule here:\n\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20100608230933/http://www.mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_fall_2009.pdf\n\n\n\nAll talks free and open to the public!\n\n\n\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-8927)",

The site chronicles the visual and textual history of Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn, and links this information to interactive maps in order to create a deeper understanding of nineteenth-century black New Yorkers. Follow the project on Twitter @bgarchive.\n\nAbout the Show:\nBrian Lehrer's local Emmy-nominated New York TV show focuses on community and society and is broadcast on Wednesdays on CUNY TV at 7:30pm. Brian also hosts a Peabody Award-winning New York radio show, the Brian Lehrer Show, broadcast weekdays at 10:00am on WNYC.

During the last years this collection, currently spread-out in about 60 libraries in Europe, North America and Israel, has been digitized by the Friedberg Genizah Project almost in full, producing some 450,000 digital images. The lecture will introduce this collection and will present some of the modules and tools that have been developed for automatically extracting data from the digital images, joining the dispersed fragments, and locating fragments by a specific handwriting.\n\nDr. Roni Shweka (PhD, Rabbinic Literature, Hebrew University, 2009) is currently a Harry Starr Fellow in the Center for Jewish Studies at Harvard University.

It is one of the largest funders of humanities programs in the United States. The Endowment awards grants to top-rated proposals examined by panels of independent, external reviewers.These grants are highly competitive and involve a rigorous peer-review process to ensure that the projects represent the highest level of humanities quality and public engagement.</span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The $217,000 grant will fund the creation of a comprehensive online collection of early educational public radio content from the National Association of Educational Broadcasters (NAEB). The forerunner of CPB and its arms, NPR and PBS, the NAEB served as the primary organizer, developer, and distributor for noncommercial broadcast production and analysis between 1925 and 1981. These broadcasts, mostly stemming from university and public school-run radio stations, provide an in-depth look at the engagements and events of American history, as they were broadcast to and received by the general public in the twentieth century. According to the project’s Lead Advisor, Josh Shepperd of Catholic University and Director of the Radio Preservation Task Force, </span>\n\n<blockquote><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“The National Association of Educational Broadcasters recordings provide valuable context into cultural, political, and less-studied, educational discourses going back to the New Deal, and associated documents help media scholars to trace the origin of script development, audience research, and genres that we associate with both public media and cable television - science, travel, food, history, and journalism programming.”</span></blockquote>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The NAEB systematically preserved its history across over a hundred boxes of documents and 5,000 reels of tape, but the organization split its archive, depositing its papers in Wisconsin and the recordings in Maryland. Archival audiovisual media has been collected and maintained separately from other kinds of (primarily textual) archival sources, and these ‘split’ collections mean that researchers must often discover and manually reunite audiovisual collections and their related materials if they want to understand a broadcast not just as an audiovisual object, but as a medium that relays information within a set of historical contexts (time, place, related events, etc.). </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlocking the Airwaves</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will reunite the split NAEB collections, develop an open and comprehensive web portal for them, and tell the story of early educational and public broadcasting.</span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By coordinating the expertise of archivists, humanities researchers, and digital humanists, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlocking the Airwaves</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will deliver enhanced access to important, mostly hidden, archival audiovisual materials by linking split hybrid paper/audiovisual collections together, and providing a search engine for the linked collections, enabling users to simultaneously search both the documents and sounds of the NAEB. The resulting resource will finally realize the potential of the collections of the NAEB for exploration and study by educators, scholars, journalists, documentarians, genealogists, and the broader public. </span>",

The purpose of this network is cooperative and collaborative action that will benefit digital humanities and allied fields in general, and centers as humanities cyberinfrastructure in particular. It comes out of a meeting hosted by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the University of Maryland, College Park, April 12-13, 2007 in Washington, D.C., responding in part to the report of the American Council of Learned Societies report on Cyberinfrastructure for the Humanities and Social Sciences, published in 2006.\r\n\r\nWe leave the definition of \"digital humanities\" up to you, but we intend to be inclusive, and we know that there will be cross-over into the social sciences, media studies, digital arts, and other related areas. If you think your center is a digital humanities center, in whole or in part, then we'd be glad to have you as part of the network. This might include humanities centers with a strong interest in or focus on digital platforms. The definition of \"center\" is only slightly more prescriptive: a center should be larger than a single project, and it should have some history or promise of persistence.\r\n\r\nSome early initiatives are likely to include\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>workshops and training opportunities for faculty, staff, and students</li>\r\n\t<li>developing collaborative teams that are, in effect, pre-positioned to apply for predictable multi-investigator, multi-disciplinary, multi-national funding opportunities, beginning with an upcoming RFP that invites applications for supercomputing in the humanities</li>\r\n\t<li>exchanging information about tools development, best practices, organizational strategies, standards efforts, and new digital collections, through a digital humanities portal</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThere is no membership fee, and the network is not a constituent of any other organization, but members should consider contributing some time or resource to the network.\r\n\r\nYou may respond to this invitation by sending email to <a href=\"mailto:centernet-owner@lists.digitalhumanities.org\">centernet-owner@lists.digitalhumanities.org</a> and if you do respond, please indicate\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>the name of your center, your title with respect to it, and the center's home institution or organization</li>\r\n\t<li>the areas or disciplines in which your center works or has worked</li>\r\n\t<li>the number of staff employed by your center</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWe would also appreciate it if you would answer two other questions:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>what might your center be willing and able to contribute to the network of centers?</li>\r\n\t<li>would you be willing to serve in an organizing role with respect to the network.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFinally, you might want to have a look at the different types of centers represented at\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://digitalhumanities.pbwiki.com/Centers%20by%20type\">http://digitalhumanities.pbwiki.com/Centers%20by%20type</a>\r\n\r\nand if yours is not there, tell us in what category to list it, and we'll add it, or if the right category doesn't exist, suggest one.\r\n\r\nThanks very much,\r\n\r\nJulia Flanders\r\n\r\nNeil Fraistat\r\n\r\nMatt Kirschenbaum\r\n\r\nMark Kornbluh\r\n\r\nJohn Unsworth[/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]",

    "wp post content": "Back in February we <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/introducing-documenting-the-now/\">announced </a>MITH's involvement in the Documenting the Now project, which is now under way. In a nutshell, Documenting the Now is an effort to build an application called DocNow, that helps researchers and archivists collect Web content about current events using Twitter. The project is also about building a community and a conversation about what it means to ethically engage in the work of social media and Web archiving. We thought we would provide a quick update about our recent work, and where you can go to learn more.\n\n\n\nSince the project is a partnership between MITH, Washington University in St Louis and the University of California at Riverside we have established a <a href=\"http://news.docnow.io\">project site</a> on Medium where all team members can share information about their work, and we can get feedback from others who are interested in the project. While you can expect to see occasional updates about Documenting the Now here on the MITH blog, please follow us <a href=\"http://news.docnow.io\">there</a> if you are interested in seeing all the developments as they happen.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of the team we <a href=\"https://news.docnow.io/building-docnow-the-team-4349e096b90#.89ib5pd1m\">recently announced</a> the initial group of staff and contractors who will be helping on the project.  Washington University hired Desiree Jones-Smith, who started in April as the Project Coordinator for Documenting the Now. One exciting thing that Desiree will be focused on is planning our face-to-face event in St Louis, where the core team, advisory board members, and others interested in the project will gather to explore the design and ethical issues in the DocNow application. Look out here and on our <a href=\"http://news.docnow.io\">project website</a> to hear more about that event in the coming weeks.\n\n\n\nAlso joining the team are three contractors: <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://twitter.com/fromADMwithlove\" data-href=\"https://twitter.com/fromADMwithlove\">Alexandra Dolan-Mescal</a>, <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://twitter.com/kayiwa\" data-href=\"https://twitter.com/kayiwa\">Francis Kayiwa</a> and <a class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" href=\"https://twitter.com/dchud\" data-href=\"https://twitter.com/dchud\">Dan Chudnov</a>. Alexandra is gathering requirements and designing the user experience of the DocNow application. Francis is designing the backend infrastructure with an eye towards containerization and cloud deployment. Dan is architecting and implementing the data analysis pipeline and visualization pieces that form a foundation of the application. If you are interested in tracking this work you can follow us over on <a href=\"http://github.com/docnow\">GitHub</a> where we will be coordinating the software development.\n\n\n\nThe Documenting the Now team is spread across the country so we needed to find a virtual environment where we can share day to day information about the work. Of course we all use email, but having a place to share documents, have conversations and see relevant news in a shared space was important to us. And of course a big part of the project is having an open conversation about the technical and ethical considerations of social media archiving. That's why we've started using a <a href=\"http://docnowteam.slack.com\">team</a> on Slack. The <a href=\"http://docnowteam.slack.com/\">Documenting the Now Slack</a> is also open to people who are interested in the project and the work of social media archiving in general. To join Slack you need to use <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Wk0JdF2Cty2VHMqpf_QlJXVKQdUtfeeFhaYRben3qaM/viewform\">this form</a> to submit a request. We hope to see you there!\n\n\n\n<em></em><em>And if that isn't enough you can subscribe for the DocNow Newsletter over at <a href=\"http://www.docnow.io\">docnow.io</a>.</em>",

Initiated by University of Maryland American Studies (and MITH) alum David Silver, \"On or around September 11, 2006, people worldwide will attend activities of discussion, dialogue, and reflection in public, academic, and school libraries. Come together and learn from your community and from your world.\" More information about The September Project is available here:\r\r\n\r\r\n<a href=\"http://www.theseptemberproject.org/\">http://www.theseptemberproject.org/</a>\r\r\n\r\r\nThere are over 400 libraries and other institutions participating world-wide.\r\r\n\r\r\nMITH's contribution will take the form of a roundtable Digital Dialogue on the September 11th Digital Archive:\r\r\n\r\r\n<a href=\"http://www.911digitalarchive.org/\">http://www.911digitalarchive.org/</a>\r\r\n\r\r\nAccording to the site, \"The September 11 Digital Archive uses electronic media to collect, preserve, and present the history of the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York, Virginia, and Pennsylvania and the public responses to them.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nA few questions to get us started (please do come with questions of your own): What does it mean to \"archive\" 9/11 on the Web? What are the boundaries of this particular Web site *as* an archive? What new or unique role do born digital materials--email, cell phone text messages, digital photographs and video, blogs, and mainstream media sites--play in the memory and preservation of 9/11? What are the particular issues and challenges involved: ethical, historiographical, and technical? How else has the Web contributed to an archiving or preservation of 9/11, including the widely viewed alternative history (\"conspiracy\") documentaries digitally distributed from YouTube and similar sites?\r\r\n\r\r\nPlease note that this Digital Dialogue will still take place during our regular Tuesday slot, on September *12*.\r\r\n\r\r\nWe have an exciting line up of Digital Dialogues scheduled for the remainder of the semester, *every Tuesday* at 12:30. Highlights of upcoming speakers include Kevin Bertram (CEO, Distributive Networks), who will present \"You Can Take It With You: The Nascent Role for Mobile in the Digital Humanities,\" as well as visits from Daniel Pitti of the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia, Jason Nelson (digital artist and poet) from Griffith University in Australia, and Stuart Moulthrop and Nancy Kaplan from the Information Arts program at the University of Baltimore. Look for our full schedule very soon.\r\r\n\r\r\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-5896).",

After 12 years in McKeldin Library, additional staff and research expansion warrant a more robust space, and we're excited. Amid the current occupant large book collection and VHS film archive, Director Neil Fraistat helped us envision an open-floor layout twice the size of our McKeldin office, and filled with light from floor-to-ceiling windows. Two glass walls frame a courtyard of green (do I hear Zen garden?), and we've already elected Grant Dickie as MITH Gardener.

    "wp post content": "At MITH we have been experimenting with the networked, distributed transcription and encoding of manuscripts during the first phase of our work on the <a href=\"http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Shelley-Godwin Archive</a>, a project that aims to provide the digitized manuscripts of Percy Bysshe Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, William Godwin, and Mary Wollstonecraft. The Archive will thus bring together for the first time ever the widely dispersed handwritten legacy of this uniquely gifted <a href=\"http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/about#firstfamily\" target=\"_blank\">family of writers</a>. The result of a partnership between the New York Public Library and MITH, in cooperation with Oxford’s Bodleian Library, the Archive also includes key contributions from the Huntington Library, the British Library, and the Houghton Library. In total, these partner libraries contain over 90% of all known relevant manuscripts.\n\nThe most immediate goal for the Archive’s current first phase is to provide access to page images under open licenses of as many of these manuscripts as possible, through a series of public releases. These began on Halloween with the release of the fully transcribed and encoded <a href=\"http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/contents/frankenstein\" target=\"_blank\">Frankenstein Notebooks</a>, containing all known draft and fair copy of the novel. <i>Frankenstein</i> will be followed in the Spring by the fully transcribed and encoded fair-copy manuscripts of Percy Shelley’s greatest poem, <i>Prometheus Unbound</i>. Typically, given the limits of funding and labor, the digitized manuscripts of the Archive will be publicly released in one of three forms of development:\n<ul>\n\t<li>page images with transcriptions that are fully corrected and TEI-encoded (as with <i>Frankenstein</i> and <i>Prometheus Unbound</i>);</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li>page images with transcriptions that have not yet been corrected (as will be the case for most of Percy Bysshe Shelley’s manuscripts at the Bodleian Library);</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n\t<li>page images only.</li>\n</ul>\nThe curatorial status of each page in the Archive is <a href=\"http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/using-the-archive\" target=\"_blank\">color-coded</a> so that during the first phase users will understand the relative trustworthiness of transcriptions. In the Archive’s subsequent phases the color-coding will also serve as an indication of what type of curatorial work users might best contribute.\n\nThe innovative technical infrastructure of the Shelley-Godwin Archive builds on linked open data principles and emerging standards such as the <a href=\"http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/about#sharedcanvaslinkedopendata\" target=\"_blank\">Shared Canvas data model</a> and the <a href=\"http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/about#textencodinginitiative\" target=\"_blank\">Text Encoding Initiative's</a> Genetic Editions vocabulary in order to open the contents of the Archive to widespread use and reuse, and to support distributed user curation in subsequent phases of the project. Users of the Archive can see and search for additions, deletions, substitutions, retracings, insertions, transpositions, shifts in hand, displacements, paratextual notes, and other variables related to the composition process.\n\nCurrently, users of the Frankenstein Notebooks have several available views of the data, beginning with the choice of selecting a “physical” or “logical” view to order the page images. For instance, the page images can be browsed in their Notebook order,<b> </b>or by chapter sequence. Once that choice has been made and an image has been selected<b>, </b>the default page view aligns side by side the page image and transcription. Other possible views include the XML-encoded transcription, or a redacted clear-reading text that omits deletions, inserts additions in their appropriate location, transposes text as indicated in the draft, and arranges text fragments in their intended sequence. Users can also zoom in on individual page images until they fill the entire window, or choose to limit their view of the transcription so that only the text written by Mary or Percy Shelley is highlighted.  Those interested in searching the Frankenstein Notebooks for the word “monster,” for instance, will see thumbnails of all the pages containing that word. This list can be filtered so that only the pages with the word “monster” in Mary Shelley’s or Percy Shelley’s hand appears, or once can choose to see only the pages in which the word “monster” has been added, or only those in which it has been deleted in either or both hands.\n\nThe kind of networked, distributed transcription and encoding a the heart of the project has been pioneered during the Archive’s first phase by a team of students in two graduate seminars at the <a href=\"http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/about#encodingcontributors\" target=\"_blank\">University of Maryland</a> and the <a href=\"http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/about#encodingcontributors\" target=\"_blank\">University of Virginia</a>, who transcribed and encoded roughly a third of the manuscript pages of <i>Frankenstein</i>, overseen by an expert encoder and a Shelley scholar. By scaling up such experiments in its next phase, the Archive will help to move textual scholarship into the classroom and, eventually, out to the public so as to make students and citizen humanists active, knowledgeable, and critical participants in the great cultural transition now underway from a Textual to a Digital Condition.\n\nBy making the Shelley-Godwin Archive material massively addressable in a form that encourages user curation and exploration, we will be transforming it into what some are calling an “animated archive,” an archive as work-site rather than simply a point of access, that can ultimately take the form of a commons through which various discourse networks related to its texts intersect and interact. Most important of all, we will be pioneering, modeling, and building an open source participatory platform through which other archives dependent on manuscripts can effect similar transformations—helping literary manuscripts to thrive in a digital world.\n\nNews of the Archive’s launch appeared in such venues as the the <i>New York Times</i>, the <i>Washington Post</i>, and the <i>Chronicle of Higher Education</i>, and some 60,000 unique visitors viewed the site within 24 hours of its launch. We invite you to see for yourself by <a href=\"http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/\" target=\"_blank\">visiting the project's website</a>.\n\n&nbsp;",

While many authors within the archival profession have written both practical and theoretical articles on archival description, there is relatively little within the professional literature that provides a conceptual framework or formalization of archival description. When these frameworks or formalizations do exist, they are seldom interconnected to the critical trend in archivistics which has developed within the last twenty-five years. These two intellectual strands investigating the larger context of archives and archival description have the potential to inform each other and become highly intertwined. This presentation will discuss the meaning, structure, and use of archival description from a variety of perspectives. We will define archival description both abstractly and in terms of its constituent components and the relationships between those components. We will also determine what archival description intends to express and convey to the variety of its audiences, as well as its intended purpose from the perspective of the archivist. With these definitions in place, we will then investigate the strengths and limitations provided by these definitions. In particular, we will analyze the constraints that current archival metadata standards place on the transformative power of archival description. Finally, we will explore possibilities for reconceptualizing the structure and model for representations of archival entities that can leverage pluralistic recontextualization as well as emerging methods for sharing and relating information, such as the Linked Data paradigm.\n\n\n\nThis presentation will be held in the MITH Conference Room.\n\n\n\nMark Matienzo is a Digital Archivist at Yale University Library's Manuscripts and Archives department and Technical Architect for the ArchivesSpace project.

    "wp post content": "New Grant Funds Tools &amp; Research to Support the Sharing of Digital Annotations\n\n\n\nAnn Arbor, MI, Brisbane QLD (Australia), College Park, MD, Fairfax, VA, Los Alamos, NM, and Urbana, IL â€• The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation (New York) has awarded $362,000 to the Open Annotation Collaboration (OAC) for Phase I of a project to build new digital annotation tools and define and demonstrate a framework for sharing annotations of digital content across the World Wide Web. The OAC includes humanities scholars, librarians, and information scientists from four universities -- George Mason University, the University of Illinois, the University of Maryland, and the University of Queensland (Australia) -- from the Los Alamos National Laboratory Research Library, and from the Office of Advanced Technology Research at JSTOR, an integrated online archive of over five million items digitized from scholarly journals and primary source archives.\n\n\n\nAnnotating is a method by which scholars across disciplines organize existing knowledge and facilitate the creation and sharing of new knowledge. It is used by individual scholars when reading as an aid to memory, to add commentary, and to classify. It can facilitate shared editing, scholarly collaboration, and pedagogy. Over time annotations can have scholarly value in their own right as a compelling form of evidence for historians and others studying the evolution of scholarly thinking. The OAC effort will focus on annotation interoperability, creating data models, standards, and tools that allow scholars working in disparate locations to share and leverage annotations of digital resources across  the boundaries of individual annotation applications and content collections.\n\n\n\nAs part of the OAC Phase I work funded by the Mellon Foundation, a new annotation tool, leveraging ongoing work at the Maryland Institute for the Humanities (MITH) that was initiated previously with a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, will be integrated into the popular Zotero Firefox Web browser extension. Created by the Center for History and New Media (CHNM) at George Mason University, Zotero helps users collect, manage, and cite research sources found on the World Wide Web.\n\n\n\nIn parallel with this work, researchers at the Center for Informatics Research in Science and Scholarship (CIRSS) at the Graduate School of Library and Information Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and at the eResearch Lab of the School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (ITEE) at The University of Queensland in Australia will examine the breadth and diversity of current annotation models and system architectures in the context of scholarly practices and scholarly-focused use cases involving annotations in both online and traditional settings.\n\n\n\nThis research, in combination with what is learned in adding new annotation functionality to Zotero, will inform the development of a shared model of scholarly annotation that supports interoperable annotations, is adaptable by existing systems, and is rooted in traditional scholarly practice. The effort to define and describe this data model and the rules for sharing and exchanging annotations will be led by researchers at the Research Library of Los Alamos National Laboratory with contributions from other members of the OAC and from the broader community involved in scholarly communications. To ensure community input, the work of the OAC will be guided by a Project Advisory Board composed of community leaders, a broad-based committee of Web technology experts, and feedback openly solicited from scholars and the scholarly communications community at large over the course of the Project.\n\n\n\nThe co-Principal Investigators for the OAC Phase I project are Timothy W. Cole of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Neil Fraistat of the University of Maryland, Jane Hunter of the University of Queensland, and Herbert Van de Sompel of Los Alamos National Laboratory.\n\n\n\nAll work produced as part of the OAC Phase I project will be made available under open source license for the free use and exploitation by other scholars and non-profit educational, scholarly and charitable institutions.\n\n\n\nFor additional information contact t-cole3 at illinois dot edu or consult the OAC Website at <a href=\"http://www.openannotation.org/\">http://www.openannotation.org/</a>",

    "wp post content": "<em>This post was written by Eric Cartier and also appears on the <a title=\"University of Maryland Special Collections Blog\" href=\"http://hornbakelibrary.wordpress.com/2013/04/05/born-digital-working-group-configuring-fred/\" target=\"_blank\">Special Collections blog</a>.</em>\n<img src=\"http://hornbakelibrary.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/fred-at-umd-libraries.jpeg\" alt=\"The FRED Workstation (Computer tower, monitor, desk and chair.)\" width=\"410\" />\n\nIn mid-March, the Tools subgroup met FRED, our Forensic Recovery of Evidence Device. The subject lines we’ve shared since then (e.g., “tinkering with FRED today”) reflect the approach we’re taking:  careful, playful, open-minded. We marveled at all the ports, laid out and photographed the various cables and adapters included in the toolbox, and took turns at the keyboard. There was much to do before any imaging occurred, though.\n\nWe spoke at length about network security, viruses, connecting to the Internet, and safeguarding personally identifiable information, which we’re sure to obtain in future images we make. Porter noted that Digital Intelligence, the company that manufactures FRED, assumes that one will connect the machine to the Internet, while Josh played the devil’s advocate, acting Thomas Pynchon-paranoid. The immediate action we took at the conversation’s conclusion was to connect to the Internet via a USB network adapter to install Microsoft Security Essentials. Next we updated all the Windows, Adobe, and Java applications. A clean machine, we agreed, should be virus protected and fitted with all the latest software updates.\n\nThe FRED system has two drives, one of which is dual partitioned into Windows 7 Ultimate (64 bit) and Win98 DOS. This is the operating system environment we initially worked in, where we made other essential downloads including BitCurator and Oracle VM VirtualBox. Later, because BitCurator is native Linux, we chose to install SUSE Linux 12.1 on FRED’s empty DATA drive.\n\n<a href=\"http://hornbakelibrary.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/fred-accessories.jpeg\"><img title=\"Accessories included in the FRED Toolbox\" src=\"http://hornbakelibrary.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/fred-accessories.jpeg\" alt=\"Accessories included in the FRED Toolbox (Software, manuals, cables, adapters)\" width=\"410\" /></a>\n\nReturning to Windows 7, the first device we connected to the UltraBay 3D Hardware Write-Blocker was Digital Stewardship’s 2 TB external hard drive, which contained images of some media from the Bill Bly Collection. Tableau Imager didn’t recognize it, nor did it register a 2 GB thumb drive that we inserted in the USB 3.0 port, although each device was visible on the list of the computer’s drives. Reading through the text-based instructions again, we discovered that the UltraBay has a power supply independent of the FRED tower (Digital Intelligence does not include diagrams or screenshots in its instructions), which, once turned on, allowed us to image the thumb drive. No matter which target directory we selected, however, the external hard drive repeatedly failed to image, due to lack of storage space. Tableau Imager offers EnCase E01 and Raw Disk dd imaging options, both of which are set to capture all the bits, so 2 TB was a bit much to ask of the machine.\n\nOur progress configuring FRED has been fun and sometimes frustrating, but always steady. Over the next couple of months, our goal is to attempt to image every imaginable format on FRED and our BitCurator Digitization Workstation. Which system, with which software (BitCurator, Tableau Imager, FTK Imager), works most effectively? Learning what’s possible to accomplish with our equipment will be a beneficial exercise to complete before the arrival of our National Digital Stewardship Residency fellow in September.",

In an application based on active learning or a similar approach, the user could identify dozens or hundreds of difficult characters that appear in the articles from that same time period, and the system would use this new knowledge to improve optical character recognition (OCR) across the entire corpus. A portion of the team's efforts will focus on the need to incentivize engagement in tasks of this type, whether they are traditionally crowdsourced or through a more active, iterative process.\n\n<strong><em>ANGLES: A web-based XML Editor</em></strong>, directed by Web Programmer <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/people/person/grant-dickie/\">J. Grant Dickie</a> and Associate Director <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/people/person/trevor-munoz/\">Trevor Muñoz</a>, was awarded a Level 2 start up award in the amount of $49,929.\n\nANGLES proposes a bridge between humanities centers who have greater resources to program scholarly software and the scholars who form the core user community for such software through their teaching and research. In conjunction with Hugh Cayless, Doug Reside, and Jon Deering, ANGLES will experiment with a solution to the adoption gap that has developed between scholars with digital materials and technical developers designing the applications scholars are using in their research by combining the model of intensive code development (a.k.a. the “code sprint”) with testing and feedback by domain experts gathered at nationally recognized disciplinary conferences. Announcements of code sprint locations will be released in early Fall 2012.\n\n<strong><em>Topic Modeling for Humanities Research</em></strong>, a one-day workshop directed by Assistant Director <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/people/person/jennifer-guiliano/\">Jennifer Guiliano</a>, received a Level 1 start up in the amount of $24,807.\n\nThe workshop will facilitate a unique opportunity for cross-fertilization, information exchange, and collaboration between and among humanities scholars and researchers in natural language processing on the subject of topic modeling applications and methods. The workshop will be organized into three primary areas: 1)an overview of how topic modeling is currently being used in the humanities; 2)an inventory of extensions of the LDA model that have particular relevance for humanities research questions; and 3)a discussion of software implementations, toolkits, and interfaces. Calls for participation in this event will be released in Summer 2012.\n\nAdditionally, MITH is delighted to announce it will partner with<a href=\"http://georgehwilliams.pbworks.com/w/page/14266798/FrontPage\"> George Williams</a>, Assistant Professor of English at the University of South Carolina Upstate, on his continuing work with <em><strong>Making the Digital Humanities More Open,</strong> </em>which received a Level 2 award of $45,959.\n\nLed locally by Assistant Director <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/people/person/jennifer-guiliano/\">Jennifer Guiliano</a>, MITH will work with <a href=\"http://braillesc.org/\">BrailleSC</a> to undertake its second stage of development by designing and deploying a WordPress‐based accessibility tool that will create braille content for end-users who are blind or low vision. Extending the use of Anthologize—a free and open source plug‐in for WordPress that currently translates any RSS text into PDF, ePub, HTML, or TEI—MITH and the BrailleSC team will develop braille output for the tool. As a result, BrailleSC will not only make it easy for content creators to convert a text into braille, thereby extending humanities content to hundreds of thousands of visually disabled readers, but will also experiment with making braille available visually through the WordPress interface.\n\n&nbsp;",

    "wp post content": "This past weekend I attended the <a href=\"http://cdrh.unl.edu/opportunities/nebraskaforum.php\" target=\"_blank\">Nebraska Digital Workshop</a> hosted by the <a href=\"http://cdrh.unl.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Center for Digital Research in the Humanities (CDRH)</a> at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, future host of Digital Humanities 2013. This was the <a href=\"http://cdrh.unl.edu/opportunities/nebraskaforum.php\" target=\"_blank\">sixth year</a> of this rather unique event, which brings three early career scholars to Lincoln to present on their digital work. Two invited senior scholars also participate in the workshops, offering reflections on DH and feedback on the younger scholars' work. During the past few years, the workshop has also served as a culminating event for interns from the IMLS-supported <a href=\"http://www.ischooldh.org/\" target=\"_blank\">DH/iSchools internship program</a>, in which MITH is a partner and internship site. The mix of early career and senior scholars in a workshop format made for an engaging and invigorating day and a half of digital humanities presentations and conversations.\n\nThe workshop kicked off on Friday evening with public lectures by the senior scholars: Susan Brown of the <em><a href=\"http://www.arts.ualberta.ca/orlando/\">Orlando Project</a></em> and the <a href=\"http://www.cwrc.ca/\">Canadian Writing Research Collaboratory (CWRC)</a>, and William G. Thomas III, from University of Nebraska-Lincoln and Director of the <a href=\"http://railroads.unl.edu/\"><em>Railroads and the Making of Modern America</em> project</a>. Brown and Thomas were asked to reflect on their own DH work and to speak to what they saw as the challenges and opportunities of digital scholarship in the humanities. Independently, they described effects of the hybridity of this particular moment in the career of DH, still balanced between digital and traditional modes of scholarship.\n\nThe title of Thomas's talk captured an important theme of the weekend's discussions---the space between \"<a href=\"http://railroads.unl.edu/blog/?p=616\" target=\"_blank\">What we think we will build and what we build in Digital Humanities</a>.\" In his talk, Thomas related a humorous anecdote about a conversation with a producer who wanted to make a film of Thomas's recent <a href=\"http://railroads.unl.edu/ironwayindex.php\" target=\"_blank\">book and digital project</a> about railroads and the American Civil War. Preparatory to this project, the producer insisted, Thomas should prepare \"a treatment\" of the railroad project, but distilling a data-rich, hybrid publication into a linear three-act structure is a misunderstanding of the kind of work Thomas was trying to do so the episode ended in confusion. This anecdote nonetheless draws attention to what remains an important issue for digital humanities: how to describe digital projects, or projects which are hybrids of digital and print scholarship, in ways that set audiences' expectations and help them \"read\" and understand the value of such projects. Brown offered similar observations in her talk---through reflections on the development of the <em>Orlando Project</em> and previews of the work underway on CWRC---focusing on ways in which digital scholarship, despite strides forward, still remains, in many ways, siloed and solitary.\n\nSaturday's session of the workshop was devoted to presentations from the selected early-career scholars: Kirsten C. Uszkalo (Simon Fraser University), Jentery Sayers (University of Victoria), and Colin F. Wilder (University of Wisconsin). Uszkalo's and Wilder's presentations offered different models of digitally-enabled scholarship on networks of people, texts, and events, using relational databases as the underlying technology. Sayers's presentation reported on work from his digital dissertation---an investigation, through the history of magnetic sound recording, of how forms of new media, first recorded sound and more recently electronic literature, came to be regarded as \"immaterial\" or \"ephemeral.\"  Sayers's talk also reflected on the multimedia authoring platform used to build his work and on issues of pedagogy related to digital humanities and new media. Ostensibly, these talks were project presentations but all three scholars did an excellent job of not simply presenting their projects but elucidating the theoretical and methodological issues that guided their projects.\n\nGood digital humanities talks consist of more than demos and reports but rapidly outstrip these banal genres to stage intellectual interventions in the disciplines of the humanities, and perhaps also computer science or information science. For example, Uszkalo describes her project, <a href=\"http://witching.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Witches in Early Modern England</a>, a combination of prosopographical database and visualization platform, as an attempt to recover through aggregation in a database the experiences of women involved in witchcraft trials in their own context. Similarly, Wilder spoke of using ontologies, formal computer models of some domain of reality (e.g., the relationships between people), to do intellectual history, tracing and testing the evolution of ideas over time within his project, <a href=\"http://sites.google.com/site/colinwilder/\" target=\"_blank\">The Republic of Literature</a>. The effect of mapping terms to ontologies is, as John Unsworth has written of text encoding, to force the humanist to confront his methods explicitly and apply his categories rigorously. Sayers described how a very simple desire, to let his audience listen to the recorded sound he was writing about, led to working with the developers of a new multimedia authoring platform, <a href=\"http://scalar.usc.edu/anvc/?page_id=6\" target=\"_blank\">Scalar</a>, currently in closed beta testing. From Sayers's talk, this particular platform may be of interest to other scholars looking for ways to publish multimedia essays---to maintain, as Sayers's said, many-to-may relationships between their writing and the objects they study. Questions about how to write dynamically to match dynamic media or about how the construction of arguments that look (and act) like networks might help students learn new skills---these are questions that the use of technology should stimulate in the humanities more broadly. As Sayers's said, \"A key competency in Digital Humanities is learning to approach software and hardware with the same rigor with which we have learned to approach texts.\"\n\nAll of the talks, by the early career scholars as much as the senior scholars, provoked much interesting and valuable discussion. The weekend offered a preview of three very promising digital projects and reinforced the place of the Nebraska Digital Workshop as a unique event on the digital humanities calendar. As the 'big tent' of digital humanities grows—and the annual Digital Humanities conference itself grows—these smaller, laboratory or workshop-style events become even more important as entry points into the larger field and opportunities for scholars to engage more with each other than might be possible at larger events.\n\nI want to thank Kay Walters and all the staff of the Center for Digital Research in the Humanities for including me in this weekend's workshop, as well as the presenters and fellow audience members for the engaging and informative sessions.\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">— — —</p>\n<small>Updated 10.19.2011 to correct spelling and grammar</small>",

This collaboration between <a href=\"https://rhizome.org/\">Rhizome</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.docnow.io/\">Documenting the Now</a> project will bring together activists, librarians, journalists, archivists, scholars, developers, and designers who are interested in generative conversations around the ethical use of the web in archives and memory work. If this sounds relevant to you please <a href=\"https://buy.acmeticketing.com/orders/177/tickets?eventId=5a7d2b1c79e71d74ef421dca&amp;date=2018-03-22T00:00:00-0400&amp;cart\">register</a> today while spots are still available. In addition to the program of panels and talks there will also be a series of workshops on the Saturday following the main event. Continue below the fold for a bit more context on why this event is important to MITH’s work here at UMD.\n\n\n\nFor the past two years our work with <a href=\"https://library.ucr.edu/\">our</a> <a href=\"https://library.wustl.edu/\">partners</a> on Documenting the Now has deepened MITH’s longstanding interest in how archives are assembled and studied as an integral part of digital humanities research. Much of MITH's previous attention in this area has focused on the construction of archives <i>in the web</i>--or rather, using the web as a means for publishing for, and engaging with, particular audiences of humanities scholars. As part of our efforts to help document the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferguson_unrest\">Ferguson Protests</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Baltimore_protests\">Baltimore Uprising</a>, and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter\">Black Lives Matter</a> movement, we have been drawn into conversations about how to build archives <i>of the web</i>, specifically of social media content such as Twitter. This engagement has led us directly into conversations about the <em>positionality</em> of archival work, and how ethics and our own values get built into collections and applications.\n\n\n\nThanks to the efforts of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BergisJules\">Bergis Jules</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vcmitchelljr\">Vernon Mitchell</a> (the projects’ two co-PIs) we have had the opportunity to <a href=\"http://www.docnow.io/meetings/stl-2016/\">engage with</a> and <a href=\"http://www.docnow.io/meetings/stl-2017/\">learn from</a> activists in Ferguson on several occasions. These activists described how they used social media as part of their work in Ferguson, and how social media records fit into their lived experience, not just as protestors, but as citizens and people. Most importantly these activists, along with an assembled group of scholars, helped us think together about what it means to do memory work as activists, archivists and social media researchers. It is not simply good enough for our project to document the events in Ferguson without engaging with and giving back to the communities we are documenting. While methods such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participant_observation\">participant observation</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_research\">action research</a> are helpful guides, there is still much work to be done in applying them as humanists and archivists to communities on the web.\n\n\n\nThe web has often been thought of as a shared public space, or as Lawrence Lessig <a href=\"https://cyber.harvard.edu/works/lessig/Fordham.pdf\">described it</a> in 1999, a <i>commons</i>:\n\n<blockquote>The internet is a commons: the space that anyone can enter, and take what she finds without the permission of a librarian, or a promise to pay. The net is built on a commons — the code of the World Wide Web, HTML, is a computer language that lays itself open for anyone to see — to see, and to steal, and to use as one wants. If you like a web page, then all major browsers permit you to reveal its source, download it, and change it as you wish. It’s out there for the taking; and what you take leaves as much for me as there was before.</blockquote>\n\nIt is astonishing how much has changed in how we think about the web since Lessig wrote those words almost 20 years ago. Far from being simply a commons that we can all take from equally, the web is now an unevenly distributed sociotechnical space, and an essential part of contemporary life. Web content exists along continuums of access and privilege, instead of in a binary, public/private state. Social media platforms are perfect examples of how communities can form in pockets the web. These communities aren’t simply part of a public commons or locked up in corporate walled gardens. We identified a real concrete need for more conversation and shared practices of how to work as scholars and archivists in an ethical, participatory way, while respecting the agency of the web communities we are attempting to remember.\n\n\n\nWith this goal in mind we invite you to join us in New York City at the Ethics and Archiving the Web forum. While the program is fixed, there are some spots available during the day long workshops if you would like to share your own work or projects with us. We hope to see you there!\n\n\n\nPlease get in touch with <a href=\"mailto:edsu@umd.edu\">Ed Summers</a> at MITH with any questions about the Documenting the Now project, or MITH's involvement in the forum.",

    "wp post content": "We very much look forward to working with three University of Maryland faculty as their research fellowships begin this Fall. Through this partnership, MITH will play a role in software and design consultation, project management guidance, building and deploying web applications, and providing workspace for the Fellows’ teams. Faculty fellows will blog on their work-in-progress and give a <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/podcast/\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Dialogue</a> during their fellowship.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.jewishstudies.umd.edu/faculty/lapin.html\" target=\"_blank\">Hayim Lapin</a> Ph.D., Robert H. Smith Professor of Jewish Studies and Professor of History, will create a digital edition of the Mishnah, a Jewish legal treatise from roughly 200 CE. An artifact of great significance to cultural, religious, and social history, this text manifests itself in several forms dating roughly from the eleventh to the fifteenth century, including a significant 1492 printed edition. The project will encode the text in <a href=\"http://www.tei-c.org\" target=\"_blank\">TEI</a>, in order to provide a research tool for the collation and comparison of text. Additionally, the database will include targeted searching, transcriptions, and an annotated translation for a wider audience.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.english.umd.edu/profiles/pmallios\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Mallios</a> Ph.D., Associate Professor of English and American Studies, will use his fellowship to direct the scholarly Foreign Literatures in America project (FLA). The FLA is a digital project dedicated to the recovery and analysis of the significance of foreign authored literature in the United States, and related questions. The project seeks to understand foreign authored literature as an integral part of both American literature and the cultural domains of the U.S., and it seeks to provide new tools of both archivally accessing and quantitatively studying the cultural and political significance of foreign authored literature in the U.S. over the course of U.S. history.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.english.umd.edu/users/cpeterso\" target=\"_blank\">Carla L. Peterson</a> Ph.D., Professor of English, will build an interactive website in order to deepen understanding of nineteenth-century black New York. Seen as an enhanced extension of Peterson’s book, <a href=\"http://yalepress.yale.edu/book.asp?isbn=9780300162554\" target=\"_blank\">Black Gotham: A Family History of African Americans in Nineteenth-Century New York City </a>(Yale University Press, 2011), the project will use the chronological history of Peterson’s own family as an entry point into a broader social and cultural history of New York City’s black elite from about 1810 to 1895. Peterson will represent the spatial history of Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn via interactive maps linked to commentary from her book and the work of other writers, to create walking tours that will allow users to queue into certain locations from their smartphones.\n\nPlease join us in welcoming Hayim, Peter and Carla to the MITH Community. Stay tuned to the latest project updates by following us <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/UMD_MITH\" target=\"_blank\">@UMD_MITH</a>.",

    "wp post content": "MITH is currently inviting applications from the University of Maryland's College of Arts &amp; Humanities and from the University Libraries for a MITH Resident Fellowship during the 2010-2011 academic year.\n\nResident Fellowships offer customized programming and technical support, as well as server space, consultation on project design, project management, software selection, and other crucial components of any digital humanities project. Ideally, faculty MITH fellows will be relieved of teaching responsibilities during the fellowship period (half-time for a year-long residence in MITH) and prospective fellows should apply to their unit, to their Dean, to one of the university's research or instructional improvement support award programs (from RASA, Undergraduate Studies, the Diversity Initiative Faculty Relations Committee, for example), and to outside sources for funds to support course buyouts. Librarians will be relieved of the equivalent of half-time yearly teaching duties and should seek support from the Dean of Libraries and outside funding sources.\n\nFellowships will be offered to professors and/or librarians developing their research, teaching, and information studies work in ways that implement and productively exploit electronic resources, with preference given to those who have worked especially to integrate their scholarly discoveries and methods into their pedagogy, mentoring, and library practices. Besides working on their proposed project, fellows are expected to present their work in MITH’s Digital Dialogue series and to become active members in the MITH community.\n\nThose interested in applying for a MITH fellowship should contact Neil Fraistat, Director of MITH (fraistat@umd.edu) in order to formulate a strategy (for course relief and other support) for a successful MITH residency. Further information about the MITH Resident Fellowship, as well as an application instructions, can be found at http://mith.umd.edu/community/fellowships/.\n\nApplications should be submitted to Neil Fraistat at MITH and are due by Monday, May 3; notifications will be made by Wednesday, May 12.",

    "wp post content": "The past two days have been a flurry of coding, sometimes even going on to 1-2 in the morning. This group is highly enthusiastic about making progress in their individual groups. This energy has been pretty contagious and I've had less time for blogging. Regardless, here's some reports from the Interedition Bootcamp weekend:\n\n\n\nSaturday night at dinner, there was a great conversation between myself and Gregor Middell about Interedition and how it differs from the normal day to day of Humanities centers. Gregor's opinion is that Interedition, as well as similar Bootcamps or 'hackathons', provide a space for DH developers to freely express ideas and experiment with their projects. Gregor's thought was that outside of bootcamps, a top-down model is used to organize outcomes of a project and limit massive scope creep and expenditures. This can feel limiting to the types of humanities researchers and hackers that come to events like Interedition and just want to try different methods to gain results. Joris van Zundert, Gregor, and the other Interedition organizers hope that their own bootcamp tradition can continue for these reasons.\n\n\n\nThis kind of attitude, I added, has implications for centers such as MITH. Originally, MITH was suggested to participate in Interedition due to our work in the <a title=\"Text and Image Linking Environment\" href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/tile\" target=\"_blank\">Text and Image Linking Environment</a> project, as well as other projects where we worked with annotation, such as the <a href=\"http://www.quartos.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Shakespeare Quartos Archive</a>. MITH has since grown and expanded in its interests, as well as the centers from which the other participants hail from. It's good that Interedition enthuses this kind of growth by offering a place to freely experiment and hack on ideas and challenges.\n\n\n\nFor OAC, we've ended up doing a lot of interesting experimentation. Asaf Bartov has created a Ruby on Rails server to act as a repository for OAC-spec-friendly annotations (Github is <a href=\"https://github.com/abartov/raxld\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, and a temporary online service is <a href=\"http://interedition.performantsoftware.com/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>). Marcos Petris (CATMA) and Moritz Wissenbach (Faust Edition) are developing a service for producing constraint URIs for OAC annotations (Github is <a href=\"https://github.com/wissenbach/fragment-context\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, plus they have a temporary installation online <a href=\"http://87.106.12.254:8182/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>). Cesar Ruiz and Jaoquin Gayoso Cabada from the University of Madrid have developed a wrapper application to interact with Asaf's online repository (Github is <a href=\"https://github.com/gayoxo/Interedition\">here</a>). I myself am working on a wrapper to register annotations with Asaf's server using the recently developed MITHGrid library (Github is <a href=\"https://github.com/jdickie/MMClient\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>). We're having some issues with jQuery ajax calls going to his server, so it's still under development - keep watching the commits on Github.\n\n\n\n<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20130404030529/http://piez.org:80/wendell/\" target=\"_blank\">Wendell Piez</a> has joined the group and is offering his help to the text editor hack group, which has made a lot of progress. They now have a text editor running with an HTML5 canvas that draws text, while also drawing underlying, color-coded annotation layers. It's a fascinating project and it's drawing a lot of attention of the group.\n\n\n\nTomorrow will be a round-up of everyone's progress, so I'll be looking forward to hearing from all of the groups and their exciting projects!\n\n\n\nI'll leave you with some pictures from last night, where we had dinner at the Old Mill restaurant - a staple of the Wuerzburg scene. Locals like to get their local wine here and sit on the nearby bridge during the day. At night, they offer some of the best food in town, as well as the best of the local wine. I hate to say it, but it's going to be hard for Maryland to top this kind of attraction.\n\n\n\n[fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=\"yes\" overflow=\"visible\"][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=\"1_1\" background_position=\"left top\" background_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" border_color=\"\" border_style=\"solid\" spacing=\"yes\" background_image=\"\" background_repeat=\"no-repeat\" padding=\"\" margin_top=\"0px\" margin_bottom=\"0px\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_direction=\"left\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" center_content=\"no\" min_height=\"none\"][caption id=\"attachment_12745\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"225\"]<img src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/PeopleEnjoyingWineMarienBridge1-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"People Enjoying Wine on Marien Bridge\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-12745\" /> Some locals enjoying wine on the Marienbruecke (Marien Bridge)[/caption]\n\n\n\n[/fusion_builder_column][fusion_builder_column type=\"1_1\" background_position=\"left top\" background_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" border_color=\"\" border_style=\"solid\" spacing=\"yes\" background_image=\"\" background_repeat=\"no-repeat\" padding=\"\" margin_top=\"0px\" margin_bottom=\"0px\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_direction=\"left\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" center_content=\"no\" min_height=\"none\"][caption id=\"attachment_12743\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"300\"]<img src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/HeadingtoCastleBeforeDinner2-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Heading to the Castle Before Dinner\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-12743\" /> Heading to the Castle Before Dinner[/caption]\n\n\n\n[/fusion_builder_column][fusion_builder_column type=\"1_1\" background_position=\"left top\" background_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" border_color=\"\" border_style=\"solid\" spacing=\"yes\" background_image=\"\" background_repeat=\"no-repeat\" padding=\"\" margin_top=\"0px\" margin_bottom=\"0px\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_direction=\"left\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" center_content=\"no\" min_height=\"none\"][caption id=\"attachment_12744\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"300\"]<img src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/viewFromMarien-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"View from Marien\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-12744\" /> And we found that it was well worth the climb[/caption]\n\n\n\n[/fusion_builder_column][fusion_builder_column type=\"1_1\" background_position=\"left top\" background_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" border_color=\"\" border_style=\"solid\" spacing=\"yes\" background_image=\"\" background_repeat=\"no-repeat\" padding=\"\" margin_top=\"0px\" margin_bottom=\"0px\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_direction=\"left\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" center_content=\"no\" min_height=\"none\"][caption id=\"attachment_12749\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"300\"]<img src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/EatingAtOldMill-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Eating at the Old Mill\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-12749\" /> A (blurry) shot of the group eating at the \"Old Mill\" -- one of Wuerzburgs institutions[/caption]\n\n\n\nAuf Wiedersehen,\n\n\n\nGrant\n\n\n\n&nbsp;[/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]",

    "wp post content": "We are quite a way through GSoC! It has been very interesting and informative experience until now. MITHgrid is a very powerful library because it places data at the center of its activities. It is very structured taking into the fact that JavaScript lacks many of the classical object oriented concepts.\n\nWe are working on making interactive use cases of MITHgrid, focusing on visualizing data. The current objective is to be finish building the data analysis web-app which facilitates in importing and visualizing data with help of MITHgrid. The flow of the application is import data, tabulate the data, clean the data, plot the data, and then allow data export. We created a new CSV importer to get data into the application. New presentations (graph and spreadsheet) have been added to MITHgrid to present and let the user interact with the data. Since it��s a two way binding, changes performed by the users on the data in these presentations get reflected in the MITHgrid data store.\n\n<a href=\"http://todomvc.com/\">Todomvc</a> is a javascript library comparison initiative which helps developers choose the best library for their project. We created a todo app that we will be publishing in the todomvc labs. The demo is temporarily hosted at <a href=\"http://goo.gl/MF9vN1\">http://goo.gl/MF9vN1</a>.\n\nWhat’s next? The graph presentation only supports scatter plots between any two variables as of now; we will add more plot types. We plan to add more presentations such as a tab presentation. Options to export data (JSON/csv) need to be added. Good progress has already been made on the exporter. There are many ideas and concepts at the heart of MITHgrid which need more documentation. Attention now turns to documenting the summer progress and creating a getting started manual to talk about the guts of MITHgrid and how you can use them to build responsive web applications.",

    "wp post content": "A MITH Digital Dialogue\nTuesday, November 16, 12:30-1:45\nMITH Conference Room, McKeldin Library B0135\n\nHow did it become commonplace for creative practitioners and engineers in contemporary audio cultures to think of sounds as individual entities, with distinct aesthetic properties that can be technologically controlled? This talk will address this metaphor of electronic sounds as individuals, which is such a familiar concept in epistemologies of digital audio that it has escaped critical attention. This metaphor took shape over the nineteenth century in tandem with the development of graphical methods that represented diverse phenomena in a common language of waveforms. Notions of sonic individuation and variability also emerged in the contexts of Darwinian thought, and a cultural fascination with electricity as a kind of animating force. Tara Rodgers argues that practices of classifying individual sounds by aesthetic variations are deeply entwined with epistemologies of gender and racial difference in Western philosophy and modern science, and that these legacies persist in contemporary representations of digital audio. This talk will also introduce some of her recent sound and music projects that complement this research by engaging metaphor as a creative tool.\n\nTARA RODGERS is a composer and feminist historian of audio technologies. She is completing her PhD in Communication Studies at McGill University and has an MFA in Electronic Music from Mills College. Her research combines methods from ethnomusicology and popular music studies, media studies, and feminist science and technology studies. She has served as a guest editor and curator for Leonardo Music Journal (MIT Press, 2006, 2010), and recently published Pink Noises: Women on Electronic Music and Sound (Duke UP, 2010), a collection of 24 interviews with women who are DJs, electronic musicians, and sound artists. She performed jazz piano for several years in New York City, has released numerous recordings of electronic music (as Analog Tara), and exhibited sound art at venues including Eyebeam (NYC) and the Museum of Contemporary Canadian Art (Toronto). Her work has received such honors as a New Genre Composition Prize from the International Alliance of Women in Music (2007), a Canada-U.S. Fulbright scholarship (2006-07), and a Best Music Web Site nomination at the Webby Awards (2003). She currently teaches in the Women's Studies department at the University of Maryland.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.pinknoises.com/\">http://www.pinknoises.com</a>\n\nView MITH’s complete Fall Speakers Schedule here:\n\n<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20111121205902/http://mith.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_fall_2010.pdf\">http://mith.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_fall_2010.pdf</a>\n\nAll talks free and open to the public!\n\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (http://mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-8927).",

PVW2 plans to help improve the capacity of libraries, museums, and archives to preserve computer games, virtual worlds, and interactive fiction.\n\nThe research team at Maryland, led by Matthew Kirschenbaum (Associate Professor of English and Associate Director of MITH) and Kari Kraus (Assistant Professor of Information Studies and English), will have a major role in all aspects of the new project, including content analysis work, interviews with game players and producers, and conducting double-blind studies to help evaluate the \"significant properties\" of games and other interactive media.\n\nKraus states,\"Preserving Virtual Worlds II proposes a novel methodology for studying the significant properties of video games and other complex interactive environments. By focusing on the temporal transitions between developer versions and player mods, we hope to identify patterns of stability and change in game attributes--such as graphics, text, sound, items, and sprites--that can help us infer how different communities of practice interpret their relative significance.\"\n\nJenny Preece, Dean of the iSchool at Maryland, notes \"In an age of complex interactive media this project offers a unique opportunity for capturing digital cultural heritage.” Kent Cartwright, Chair of English, adds \"It is thrilling to see two of our brilliant young faculty members deeply involved in this major project.\" Neil Fraistat, Director of MITH, comments \"This innovative project provides an important bridge not only between iSchools and the Humanities, but also between archival studies and textual scholarship. MITH is pleased to be continuing the very fruitful partnership begun in the first phase of the project.\"\n\nThis grant news caps off a remarkable trifecta of achievements for this multi-institutional interdisciplinary research group, which also includes being shortlisted for the prestigious Digital Preservation Coalition prize (winner to be announced in December) and the release of a 200-page final report on phase one of the project, available here: <a href=\"https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/handle/2142/17097\">https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/handle/2142/17097</a>.",

    "wp post content": "MITH is pleased to announce that Hester Baer, Vambery Distinguished Professor of Comparative Studies for the 2014-15 academic year, has also been named a MITH Fellow for the same period.  During her fellowship year, Hester will be working on her project, <i>Digital Feminisms: Transnational Activism in German Protest Cultures.</i>\n\nHester Baer is Associate Professor of German at the University of Maryland, where she also serves as a core faculty member in the Film Studies program. Baer’s research interests focus on gender and sexuality in film and media, historical and contemporary feminisms, and German literature and culture in the 21st Century. She is the author of <i>Dismantling the Dream Factory: Gender, German Cinema, and the Postwar Quest for a New Film Language</i> (2009); the guest editor of a special issue of the journal <i>Studies in 20th &amp; 21st Century Literature</i> entitled \"Contemporary Women's Writing and the Return of Feminism in Germany\" (2011); and the co-editor with Alexandra Merley Hill of the volume <i>German Women’s Writing in the 21</i><i>st</i><i> Century</i> (forthcoming in 2014). She is currently working on a new monograph that rethinks the history of German cinema from 1980-2010, <i>German Cinema in the Age of Neoliberalism</i>. Since 2012, Baer has served as President of the Coalition of Women in German.\n\n<i>Digital Feminisms: Transnational Activism in German Protest Cultures</i> examines the reconfigurations of feminist activism in the context of rapid technological change, analyzing how the increased use of digital media has altered, influenced, and shaped feminist politics in the twenty-first century. Addressing the role of digital media in the transnational flow of feminist ideas, politics, and protesters, the project focuses on Germany in order to examine the way transnational feminist activism intersects with the national configuration of feminist political work, and how feminist activism may in turn transform emergent digital cultures. Bringing together scholars from the US, Canada, Germany, and the UK, this transdisciplinary, collaborative project engages digital media not only as its scholarly focus but also as a key component of the project's methodology. Combining digital humanities paradigms with a conventional academic publishing project, <i>Digital Feminisms </i>seeks to develop a new research model that reaches multiple constituencies, while also reflecting critically on the subject of transnational feminist activism and digital culture through its presentation formats.\n\nMITH is very excited to have opportunities for conversation and exchange with Hester over the next school year.  Please join us in congratulating Hester on her award!\n\n<a title=\"Hester Baer\" href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/people/person/hester-baer/\">Hester's MITH Staff Page</a>\n\n&nbsp;",

    "wp post content": "Thanks to the input of Travis Brown, Assistant Director at MITH and the programmer working on this project, I am now revisiting the organization of the project and its constituent files. We are now working with a central text, that will be pre-tokenized [fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=\"yes\" overflow=\"visible\"][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=\"1_1\" background_position=\"left top\" background_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" border_color=\"\" border_style=\"solid\" spacing=\"yes\" background_image=\"\" background_repeat=\"no-repeat\" padding=\"\" margin_top=\"0px\" margin_bottom=\"0px\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_direction=\"left\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" center_content=\"no\" min_height=\"none\"][broken into discrete and uniquely identified units by word] to which all the witnesses can link. This will result, ultimately, in undoing some of the work already done on the manuscripts but will generate less redundancy, and more flexibility for collation and output.\n\nThanks to the input of Trevor Muñoz, Associate Director at MITH and an Assistant Dean at McKeldin Libraries, I hope to have a customized ODD file for the project. Again, customizing will mean undoing some work, but progress nonetheless.\n\nFor those in the Rabbinic texts biz, here is an issue that I have had to make a compromise/decision on that's worth talking about further: what to use as the base text. My decision has been to use the Vilna printed version as it appeared in the Yakhin u-vo'az edition by the Romm press that appeared in the early 1900s. There is a practical reason for this: it is freely and easily available, and largely transcribed already in wikis etc. There are methodological reasons for this as well, though. First, it is likely to be the longest text, making it possible to link to the \"pluses\" that appear in some recensions but not others. Second, it is the most widely accessed text (even scholars regularly engage with it in its close relation, the edition of Albeck). Finally, it is the one text that, as clearly modern, does not represent a \"primary source.\" To use a manuscript source (e.g., Kaufmann A60) requires both verifying that text and presuming that it represents an archetypal text (as Y. Kutscher argued).\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">___________</p>\n<em>editor's note</em>: Hayim Lapin is Robert H.

The workshop was organized by Julia Flanders (Brown University) and Fotis Jannidis (University of Würzburg) and is being supported through generous funding from the DFG/NEH Bilateral Digital Humanities Program.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://datasymposium.wordpress.com/people/\">roster of other speakers</a> at the event is top-notch and all the <a href=\"http://datasymposium.wordpress.com/abstracts/\">presentations</a> promise to be engaging. For my part, I was asked to contibute to a more practically-oriented section on &#8220;Research Ontologies&#8221;—focusing on how data modeling happens in humanities projects—and also, to talk a little about the similarities and differences related to modeling data in a DH context versus a library one. </p>\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll be speaking about the process we&#8217;re engaged in now here at MITH for developing the data models that underlie our transcriptions of materials for the <a href=\"http://www.shelleygodwinarchive.org/\">Shelley-Godwin Archive</a>. Data modeling is an immensely-important but largely under-discussed topic in digital humanities (it&#8217;s certainly under-represented in the published literature—though this conference is part of an effort to change that). Data modeling is part of the crucial &#8220;DH-specific&#8221; intellectual work of translating between the (often implicit) understandings that scholars have of the objects they study and the affordances of a particular digital technology (which might be a relational database or TEI XML or any number of things). For projects that are attempting to conform to standards and best practices, data modeling never begins from a blank slate. I&#8217;m particularly interested in the ways—social, conceptual, and technical—that we use to build (and hopefully share) data models for our projects within an ecology of &#8220;received ideas&#8221; in the form of something like the <a href=\"http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/index-toc.html\">TEI Guidelines</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The workshop is intended to engage remote participants as well as those of us who will be in Providence this week. I strongly encourage interested members of MITH&#8217;s community to follow along <a href=\"http://datasymposium.wordpress.com/\">on the web</a> and via <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/datasymposium\">Twitter</a>.</p>",

    "wp post content": "Renowned ballerina <a href=\"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Suzanne_Farrell\" target=\"_self\">Suzanne Farrell</a> performed an exceptional 28 years before retiring from an established and widely-accomplished career. Having danced for world-famous companies in Berlin, New York City, Paris and Vienna, Farrell gained an unparalleled wealth of knowledge and expertise that she then chose to pass down to the next generation of dancers as teacher and founder of her own company, the Suzanne Farrell Ballet at the <a href=\"http://www.kennedy-center.org\" target=\"_self\">John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts</a>.\n\nThe case of Ms. Farrell illustrates the need to preserve knowledge like hers, and the challenges that surround dance documentation: how does one document and preserve motion through space and time? Art museums conserve paintings; libraries house books; but how does one archive a series of fleeting movements? Considerable work on dance documentation has been completed in recent years using notation systems, video, motion capture technologies and oral history. Though, as Doug Reside, Digital Curator of Performing Arts at the New York Public Library notes in his recent <a href=\"http://www.nypl.org/blog/2011/05/02/how-can-we-know-dancer-from-dance\" target=\"_self\">blog post</a>, limits of dimension and perspective have forced an urgency for more sophisticated technologies in order to preserve this fluid art form.\n\n<img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-12598\" alt=\"preservation_of_dance_sm\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/preservation_of_dance_sm.jpg\" width=\"250\" height=\"392\" />\n\nFortunately, a skilled interdisciplinary team from the <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu\" target=\"_self\">Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities</a> (MITH) and the <a href=\"http://www.sph.umd.edu/KNES\" target=\"_self\">Kinesiology Department</a> at the University of Maryland, the <a href=\"http://accad.osu.edu\" target=\"_self\">Advanced Computing Center for the Arts and Design</a> (ACCAD) at Ohio State University, the Kennedy Center, and the <a href=\"http://www.nypl.org/locations/lpa\" target=\"_self\">New York Public Library for the Performing Arts</a> have teamed dancers, choreographers, software developers, scholars and archivists to establish the <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/research/the-documentation-and-preservation-of-dance/\" target=\"_self\">Documentation and Preservation of Dance </a>project in order to explore challenges surrounding dance preservation. This project has been generously funded by Ohio State University and by a seed grant from the Office of Vice President for Research and College for Arts and Humanities at the University of Maryland.\n\nLast October the group kicked off a series of workshops devoted to collaborative discussions that established the current state of the art and fleshed out how to document its existence. The first two-day private meeting, held at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, brought together choreographers, dancers, scholars and archivists. <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/dance-preservation/documentation.html\" target=\"_self\">Topic discussions</a> ranged from notation to oral tradition, motion capture technology to brain imaging techniques.  A second two-day private meeting followed at Ohio State’s ACCAD, where technology experts further surveyed issues of dance preservation and documentation.\n\nNext Monday, May 16th, Suzanne Farrell returns to the Kennedy Center for the third and final meeting of the Documentation and Preservation of Dance project. We invite you to join us on Monday, from 7:00 to 10:00 pm; the event is free and open to the public. Accompanying Ms. Farrell, a panel of experts on dance and technology will discuss the outcomes of the previous two workshops and a direction for moving forward. In addition to a reconstruction of a late choreographer’s work, a kinesiology demo will highlight what happens in the brain when the body moves. Ms. Farrell has devoted the later part of her life to passing on knowledge acquired from teacher George Balanchine to future generations. This project seeks to better document the skill of renowned dancers like Ms. Farrell, and advance efforts on the pressing problem of dance preservation.\n\nAdmission is free, but reservations are recommended and can be made by calling the <a href=\"http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/index.cfm?fuseaction=showEvent&amp;event=PLPEC\" target=\"_self\">Kennedy Center</a> at <a href=\"tel:202-416-8811\" target=\"_blank\">202-416-8811</a>.\n\nImage credit: Ruth St. Denis in Radha (ca. 1906).

    "wp post content": "A MITH Digital Dialogue\nTuesday, September 14th, 12:30-1:45\nMITH Conference Room, McKeldin Library B0135\n\n\"The iPad: The 'Jesus Tablet' and the Resurrection of Consumer Society\" by ZEYNEP TUFEKCI and NATHAN JURGENSON\n\nApple’s much-discussed iPad fits more within the logic of consumer society rather than the participatory Web 2.0 with its focus on active participation, diminishing corporate control, and a trend towards free products and services (what has come to be known as \"prosumer society\"). In contrast to Web 2.0, where users as \"prosumers\" actively participate in the production of that which they consume and often create systems from the bottom-up, the iPad channels passive consumption, corporate control via “closed” systems and a renewed focus on traditional, top-down, pay-per-view media. Indeed, the iPad is engineered to enforce this passivity, for example through lack of a tactile keyboard. The iPad is indicative of Apple’s Disneyfied approach in the way it produces spectacle to enchant or \"wow\" individuals into passive consumption, attempts to exercise control by creating a “walled garden,” and seeks to monetize more and more of the interactions within the system.\n\nZEYNEP TUFEKCI is an assistant professor of Sociology at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, where her main research interests are the social impacts of technology, theorizing the web, gender, research methods, inequality and new media. Her work has been featured in a variety of media outlets including the New York Times, the Washington Post and Science.\n\nNATHAN JURGENSON is a doctoral student in sociology at the University of Maryland where he is working with George Ritzer on the theoretical implications of the bottom-up turn taken by the Internet—what has come to be known as Web 2.0. His future work will involve rethinking how sociological theory (especially postmodern thought) orients our understanding of Web 2.0, and, in turn, how Web 2.0 provides fertile ground to rethink sociological theory in areas such as knowledge production, the presentation of self, consumption, authority, exploitation, and many others.\n\nComing up @ MITH September 21st: MITH will host an OpenStreetMap mapping party\n\nView MITH’s complete Fall Speakers Schedule here:\n\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20111121205902/http://mith.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_fall_2010.pdf\n\nAll talks free and open to the public!\n\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (http://mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-8927).",

While some digital forensics tools have natural applications or parallels in digital curation, they are currently not very approachable to library/archives professionals in terms of interface, operation, and documentation. Furthermore, some of the functionality required by collecting institutions is incomplete or absent from software designed for the forensics industry:<img class=\"alignright wp-image-12771 \" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_2763xx-735x980.jpg\" alt=\"Matthew Kirschenbaum Shares Deena Larsen Collection\" width=\"295\" height=\"393\" />\n\n<ol>\n\n\t<li>Incorporation into the workflow of archives/library ingest and collection management, e.g. metadata conventions, hooks into existing content management system (CMS) environments. Addressing these issues may include bridging open source tools through existing APIs, export scripts (as standalone programs or modules for existing software) to crosswalk forensics and archival metadata, and modifying triage techniques to better meet the needs of archivists and librarians.</li>\n\n\t<li>Provision of public access to the data. The typical digital forensics scenario is a criminal investigation in which the public never gets access to the evidence that was seized. By contrast, collecting institutions that are creating disk images face issues of how to provide access to the data. This includes not only access interface issues, but also how to redact or restrict access to components of the image, based on confidentiality, intellectual property or other sensitivities.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nThe software and expertise provided by BitCurator will attempt to fill this gap, providing these institutions with a simplified means of leveraging powerful digital forensics tools through reuse and repackaging of existing software and development of new software environments to facilitate curatorial and archival activities.\n\n\n\nMeeting attendees included Cal Lee, principal investigator; Matthew Kirschenbaum, co-principal investigator; Kam Woods, Technical Lead; Alex Chassanoff, Project Manager; Porter Olsen (Project Assistant); and the <a href=\"http://www.bitcurator.net/people/\" target=\"_blank\">Professional Experts Panel</a>:\n\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Bradley Daigle (University of Virginia Library)\n\nErika Farr (Emory University)\n\nJeremy Leighton John (British Library)\n\nLeslie Johnston (Library of Congress)\n\nCourtney Mumma (City of Vancouver Archives)\n\nNaomi L. Nelson (Duke University)\n\nErin O'Meara (University of North Carolina)\n\nMichael Olson (Stanford University)\n\nGabriela Redwine (University of Texas, Austin)\n\nSusan Thomas (University of Oxford)</p>\n\nTrevor Muñoz, Assistant Director of MITH, Kari Kraus, assistant professor in the College of Information Studies and the Department of English at the University of Maryland, and Rachel Donahue, graduate student in Maryland's College of Information Studies also attended.\n\n<img class=\"alignleft  wp-image-12769\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_2729-980x735.jpg\" alt=\"Attendees Enjoy a Break at BitCurator Conference\" width=\"291\" height=\"218\" />Matthew Kirschenbaum says, \"This was the absolute A-team of the archivists at the forefront of processing and preserving born-digital cultural heritage. There is simply no better group to be advising the BitCurator team on the requirements and needs of the real-world collecting institutions in which the software will ultimately be deployed. It was a productive and collegial meeting, and all the more satisfying because so many people in the room have already collaborated with one another on related projects.\"\n\n\n\nRead more about BitCurator on the <a href=\"http://www.bitcurator.net/\" target=\"_blank\">project website</a> or follow on Twitter <a href=\"//twitter.com/bitcurator\" target=\"_blank\">@bitcurator</a>.",

    "wp post content": "The University of Maryland is part of an international and multi-institutional research team recently awarded a two-year $1,000,000 grant by The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation for a humanities text-mining project called \"Metadata Offer New Knowledge\" (MONK). The project, directed by John Unsworth at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, also includes faculty, staff, and students from Northwestern University, McMaster University, the University of Nebraska, and the University of Alberta, as well as the National Center for Supercomputing Applications.\r\n\r\nLocally for Maryland, MONK's work represents a collaboration between the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH), where <strong>MATTHEW KIRSCHENBAUM</strong>--the Maryland MONK team leader--is Associate Director, as well as the Human Computer Interaction Lab (HCIL) under the auspices of <strong>CATHERINE PLAISANT</strong>, and contributions from <strong>MARTHA NELL SMITH</strong> of the Maryland English department. Graduate students, visiting researchers, or full-time staff from MITH, HCIL, and the English department are also all playing key roles.\r\n\r\nThe foundation for MONK is the work and progress of two existing research projects: the Nora Project, a multi-institutional endeavor in which the principals at Maryland also participated, and WordHoard, directed by Martin Mueller and based at Northwestern University. Both Nora and WordHoard apply similar text-mining techniques to digital humanities collections, though the focus of Nora has been on 18th and 19th-century British and American literature, and WordHoard has concentrated on earlier texts, including Shakespeare, Chaucer, and early Greek epic literature.\r\n\r\nMONK will bring together these two projects to create an inclusive and comprehensive text-mining and text-analysis tool-kit for scholars in the humanities.\r\n\r\nCommenting on this work, Unsworth said, \"Over the last decade, many millions of dollars have been invested in creating digital library collections: at this point, terabytes of full-text humanities resources are publicly available on the web. Those collections, dispersed across many different institutions (not only libraries but also publishers and search engines) are large enough and rich enough to provide an excellent opportunity for text-mining, and we believe that web-based text-mining tools will make those collections significantly more useful, more informative, and more rewarding for research and teaching.\"\r\n\r\nThe Mellon grant covers two phases of the project. The first phase will combine the texts used as testbeds for both Nora and WordHoard, add additional texts, and develop the infrastructure and interfaces to support analysis and investigation of this testbed. The second phase will investigate social software approaches to allow users to share their text-mining worksets and results. Integral in this phase will be the participation of libraries as test sites for deploying these tools alongside existing collections; partners in this phase will include the libraries at some or all of the institutions participating in MONK.\r\n\r\nInformation about MONK will be available soon at <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20130908124819/http://monkproject.org/\">www.monkproject.org/</a>\r\n\r\nThis two-year grant begins in January 2007 and will run through January 2009.",

    "wp post content": "This blog describes my progress on a born-digital critical edition of the Mishnah. For the various audiences who might read this, let me break out the terms and discuss them further.\n<ul>\n\t<li><em>Born-digital</em>: An edition that uses or develops technology to record, store, present, search, analyze, and study textual material, rather than a static presentation of my research.</li>\n\t<li><em>Critical edition</em>: An edition that attempts to deal seriously with the state of a text, typically based on comparison of manuscripts. There is substantial debate about what text the edition is trying to recover (original? at some moment?), and whether this is even possible, and scholars of rabbinic texts have generally chosen one print or manuscript witness as a base \"copy text\" rather than a reconstructed text.</li>\n\t<li><em>Mishnah</em>: A legal text produced about 200 AD/CE. Still studied today in Jewish religious circles of all kinds, the text is the basis of the Talmuds (there is both a Palestinian and a Babylonian Talmud), and is of enormous historical significance as well.</li>\n</ul>\nThe text is preserved in manuscripts the very earliest perhaps from the ninth or tenth centuries but most later, and was first printed in 1492 in Naples. There are several substantial manuscripts including the whole text or large blocks of it, but there are also fragmentary manuscripts of one or a few leaves from the Cairo Genizah, a cache of documents from Egypt, mostly from the tenth to the thirteenth centuries. These are among the earliest manuscripts. The textual transmission is also preserved in citations from the Talmud, and in citations of medieval scholars in their legal or commentary works.\n\nI have recently begun as a faculty fellow at MITH, the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities, to develop a pilot edition using a single chapter, Bava Metsi'a Chapter 2, dealing with lost objects. To date, I have (with the assistance of students!) encoded several witnesses using the TEI encoding protocol, and developed some XSLT style sheets to display the results in HTML. I am now working with the good people at MITH to develop an ODD, and work on a pilot webservice to test the project, while continuing to work on transcriptions. Some sample texts are viewable at <a href=\"//sites.google.com/site/digitalmishnah/files\">https://sites.google.com/site/digitalmishnah/files</a>.\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">____________</p>\n<em>editor's note</em>: Hayim Lapin is Robert H.

Topics that might be expected to come up include: what it means to \"publish\" online; peer review, credit, and perceptions of prestige for online publishing; editorial standards in electronic journals; copyright and the economics of scholarly publishing in the present climate; whether the journal format itself is viable online, or whether blogs, bulletin boards, and other forums are more appropriate; libraries and electronic journals; how new media will alter the materiality and substance of scholarship; and the longevity of the scholarly record as it sheds its traditional embodiment in paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMITH (the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities) is located in the basement of McKeldin Library, B0131. The discussion is open to all. Graduate students are especially encouraged to attend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nView MITH's complete Spring Speakers Schedule here:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100609001120/http://mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_spring_2006.pdf\">http://mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_spring_2006.pdf</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Acting Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-5896).",

Using the online book-cataloging site LibraryThing.com, scholars and volunteers from institutions around the country - including Monticello, the Boston Public Library, the Massachusetts Historical Society, the Boston Athenaeum, the American Antiquarian Society and others - have begun the process of creating an extensive online database of early American libraries. Current subjects include Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Lady Jean Skipwith, James and Mary Murray, and other early American readers (some well-known, others obscure).\n\nUnlike standalone institutional databases or online library catalogs, the Libraries of Early America collections through LibraryThing allow users to quickly and easily make comparisons between libraries (what books did John Adams and Benjamin Franklin have in common, for example, or what books were most commonly shared among all the Signers of the Declaration of Independence?), and to search collections which may not exist today in physical form or which are spread across multiple institutions and private collections. A reconstruction of the multi-generational Mather Family library makes those titles widely available for the first time. Further, LibraryThing's capabilities allow significant data about each book to be added to the record where known: transcriptions of marginalia, information about acquisition of the title, the binding, correspondence about a given book, or even a link to a digital scan of the volumes (as with the John Adams collection at the Boston Public Library).\n\nSo far, data on more than 1,250 early American libraries has been added, with more information constantly being collected and included. I'll discuss the origins of the project, sources and methods, and future plans and enhancements.\n\nThis talk will be held in the MITH Conference Room.\n\n<strong>Jeremy Dibbell</strong> is the Librarian for Social Media and Rare Books at LibraryThing. He received his B.A. from Union College and M.A./M.L.S. degrees in History and Library Science from Simmons College. In the summers, he can generally be found at the University of Virginia's Rare Book School, assisting with the school's weeklong courses. Along with the Libraries of Early America project, Jeremy's at work on a history of books and printing in Bermuda, writes regular columns for \"Fine Books &amp; Collections\" magazine, and blogs about books and reading at PhiloBiblos (philobiblos.blogspot.com). He can be found on Twitter at @JBD1.\n\nA continuously updated schedule of talks is also available on the Digital Dialogues webpage.\n\nUnable to attend the events in person?\n\nArchived podcasts can be found on the MITH website, and you can follow our Digital Dialogues Twitter account @digdialog as well as the Twitter hashtag #mithdd to keep up with live tweets from our sessions.\n\nAll talks free and open to the public. Attendees are welcome to bring their own lunches.\n\nContact: Emma Millon, Community Lead, MITH (http://mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-9887).",

    "wp post content": "<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-125feac3-fdbd-0d05-f872-e6efd49c0f1f\">In 1813 the United States Supreme Court heard arguments in one of the first petitions for freedom by an enslaved person. Mima Queen sued John Hepburn claiming she was descended from a free woman. Francis Scott Key argued the case for her, but Chief Justice John Marshall wrote the majority opinion denying her petition. Queen and her child Louisa remained in slavery. A few months later Key wrote the \"Star Spangled Banner\" and the British invaded Maryland and burned parts of Washington, D.C.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">New research suggests there is more to this story that the limited viewpoint provided in the Supreme Court's opinion. Francis Scott Key, for one, was involved in many such petitions, and his uncle Philip Barton Key represented an earlier generation of Queens. The lone dissenting justice on the Supreme Court, Gabriel Duvall, came from a prominent Maryland slaveholding family, and as a lawyer he had joined Philip Barton Key representing the Queens. Numerous other Maryland African American families filed similar petitions in the newly created District of Columbia circuit court of appeals beginning in the early 1800s.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The O Say Can You See: Early Washington D.C. Law and Family Project has received a two-year $200,000 Collaborative Research grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities to digitize and make available the case files of the D.C. circuit court and to uncover the social networks of early Washington, D.C.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Scholars from the University of Maryland and the University of Nebraska will collaborate on research to understand the web of litigants, jurists, and other participants in D.C., and to place these multigenerational family networks in the foreground of the story of the founding of the nation's capital.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“The O Say Can You See Project offers the opportunity to extend our use of digital tools and technologies to legal history,” said Jennifer Guiliano, Assistant Director of the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities and one of the co-principal investigators of the project. “We want to not just make these underutilized records visible to the public, but also to imagine new ways for historians and genealogists to navigate the complex records that document families in early Washington and Maryland—whether these records are material, cultural, or legal.”</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The case of Mima Queen will serve as one focal point for this investigation of family, law, and slavery. Claiming that she and her child should be emancipated from slavery because she was descended from Mary Queen, a free woman, Mima Queen leveraged an increasingly common legal tactic utilized by and on behalf of African Americans in the early American republic to argue for their freedom. But her case hinged on a larger transition for Maryland and Virginia--from colonies to states in a post-Revolutionary United States. Mima Queen v. Hepburn (11 U.S. 290) was one of the first landmark Supreme Court cases in the new nation to pit human rights against property rights.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">William G. Thomas, co-principal investigator, is writing a new book on the Queen case and the contests over freedom and slavery in the aftermath of the American Revolution. \"The history of slavery and freedom whether on the local or the national scale is also the history of families and the law,\" said Thomas, \"We can't understand one without the other.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The O Say Can You See Project will also use the case files of the D.C. court to recover and make visible the names of African American family members from in D.C. who mainly came from Maryland and Virginia. These family names and relationships are found on court affidavits and other documents.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The O Say Can You See Project is a partnership between the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities, the Department of History at the University of Nebraska, and the Center for Digital Research in the Humanities at the University of Nebraska. This collaboration will produce a series of virtual seminars to focus scholarly attention on the broader questions surrounding family networks as well as articles focusing on the challenges of data curation and digitization of petitions and civil cases in Prince George's County and Washington, D.C.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The participation of experts in data curation from the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities is a key part of the project’s emphasis on opening up this dimension of historical research to wider participation and re-use. “The close working partnership of historians and data curators will generate new insights on how fragile and often fragmentary historical records can be made useful to future generations of scholars and genealogists,” said Trevor Muñoz, Associate Director of the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities and Assistant Dean for Digital Humanities Research at the University of Maryland Libraries.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>",

This exciting series of lectures starts today.\n\nFrom the abstract for the series:\n\n\"Feminisms in the Digital Age: Transnational Activism in Germany and Beyond\" is a digital lecture series that explores the political impact of feminist activisms in the 21st century. In five lectures and a concluding roundtable, we interrogate the digital interface of transnational protest movements and local activism in feminist politics. The lectures take contemporary German protest culture as a case study for the manner in which transnational feminist activism intersects with the national configuration of feminist political work. We explore how movements and actions from outside Germany’s borders circulate digitally and resonate differently in new local contexts, and further, how these border-crossings transform grass-roots activism as it goes digital.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-13417\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Feminisms-in-the-Digital-Age-Transnational-Activism-in-Germany-and-Beyond.png\" alt=\"Feminisms in the Digital Age - Transnational Activism in Germany and Beyond\" width=\"316\" height=\"410\" />\n\nLectures will be posted weekly on Mondays beginning today, November 3, 2014.

    "wp post content": "The <a title=\"Enhancing Music Notation Addressability\" href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/research/enhancing-music-notation-addressability/\">Enhancing Music Notation Addressability</a> project (EMA) is creating a system to address specific parts of a music document available online. By addressing we mean being able to talk about a specific music passage (cfr. Michael Witmore’s <a href=\"http://winedarksea.org/?p=926\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> on textual addressability).\n\nOn paper, something equivalent could be done by circling or highlighting a part of a score. But how could this be done on a music document on the web? Would it be possible to link to a part of a score like I can link to a paragraph of a wikipedia page? How precise can I be?\n\nEnhancing this kind of addressability could be useful to quote passages, express analytical statements and annotations, or pass a selection of music notation on to another process for rendering, computational analysis, etc.\n<h3>Project Progress as of November 2014</h3>\nMost of our efforts have been focused on creating a URI syntax to address common western music notation regardless of the format of a music notation document. Music notation is represented in a variety of digital formats and there isn’t an equivalent of a “plain text” music document. Even the simplest music note is represented differently across systems. Nonetheless, there are certain primitives that are common to most music notation representation systems. These are the ones that we are considering now:\n\n<i>beat</i>: music notation relies on beat to structure events, such as notes and rests, in time.\n\n<i>measures</i>: typically indicated by bar lines, measures indicate a segment corresponding to a  number of beats.\n\n<i>staves:</i> staves in scores separate music notation played by different instruments or group of instruments.\n\nConsider the following example (from <a href=\"http://digitalduchemin.org/piece/DC0519/\" target=\"_blank\"><i>The Lost Voices</i></a> project), where we want to address the notation highlighted in red:\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-13429 size-large\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/EMA_ex.png\" alt=\"DC0519 L’huillier, Si je te voy\" width=\"410\" height=\"206\" />\n\nWe can say that it occurs between measure 38 and 39, on the first and third staves (labelled <i>Superius</i> and <i>Tenor</i> — this is a renaissance choral piece). Measure 38, however, is not considered in full, but only starting from the third beat (there are four beats per measure in this example).\n\nAccording to our syntax, this selection could be expressed as follows:\n\n<code>document/measures/staves/beats/</code>\n<code>dc0519.mei/38-39/1,3/3-3</code>\n\nThe selection of measures is expressed as a range (38-39), staves can be selected through a range or separately with a comma (1,3), and beats are always relative to their measure, so 3-3 means from the third beat of the starting measure to the third beat of the ending measure. Things can get more complicated, but for that we defer to the <a href=\"https://github.com/umd-mith/ema/blob/master/docs/api.md\" target=\"_blank\">Music Addressability API </a>documentation that we've been writing (beware: it’s still a work in progress, feel free to contribute on GitHub!)\n\nOne important aspect worth noting is that the beat is the primary driver of the selection: only selections that are contiguous in beat can be expressed with this system. For now, this seems to be a sufficiently flexible way of addressing music notation and we’re working on a way to group several selections together in case the addressing act needs to be more complex — more on this next time.\n<h3>Upcoming goals for the project</h3>\nDefining a Music Addressability API is fun, but it’s useless without an implementation. So we’re working on a web service able to parse the URL syntax described in the API and to retrieve the addressed music notation from a file encoded according the Music Encoding Initiative format (MEI). Unlike the URL syntax, the implementation has to be format specific, because it needs to know how measures, staves, and beats are represented to be able to parse and retrieve them.\n\nWe’re using MEI because our next step in the new year will be focusing on our case-study data: a corpus of renaissance songs edited and published by the <a title=\"Lost Voices project\" href=\"http://digitalduchemin.org\" target=\"_blank\"><i>Lost Voices</i></a> project. Students involved on the project have created a number of micro-analyses of different parts of the scores; we’ll re-model them using the URL syntax specified by the Music Addressability API to test its effectiveness.\n<h3>Challenges still ahead</h3>\nAfter collecting feedback from the MEI community, we were able to identify some aspects of the API that still need to be ironed out. Relying on beat works well because music typically has beat. Music notation, however, often breaks rules in favor of flexibility. Cadenzas, for example, are ornamental passages of an improvisational nature that can be written out with notation that disregards a measure’s beat. How could we address only part of a cadenza if beat is not available? This is one of a few ideas that are drawing us back to the whiteboard and we look forward to developing solutions.\n\nIf you’re interested in what EMA is setting out to do, please do get in touch and make sure to keep an eye on our GitHub repository where we’ll keep updating the API and release tools.\n\n<em>EMA is a one-year project funded by the NEH DH Start-Up Grants program.</em>",

However, by visualizing certain of its patterns--by looking at the text \"from a distance\"--through textual analytics and visualizations, one can read the novel in ways formerly impossible and re-evaluate whether there is or is not \"a there there.\" This talk will focus on how various analytic methods (such as text mining and frequent pattern recognition) and visualization tools (such as FeatureLens and Spotfire) under research in the MONK project (http://www.monkproject.org/) have been used to achieve a new *non*-reading of the text which Stein called her \"masterpiece\" and critiques called \"linguistic murder.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nTANYA CLEMENT is an English PhD candidate at the University of Maryland, College Park. Her focus of study is textual and digital studies as it pertains to applied humanities computing and modernist American literature. She has an M.F.A. in fiction from the University of Virginia, where she was also trained in humanities computing at the Electronic Text Center and the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities. At the University of Maryland, she has been a Program Associate at the Maryland Institute for Technologies in the Humanities and project manager for the Dickinson Electronic Archives (www.emilydickinson.org). Presently, she is a graduate assistant in the Office of Digital Collections and Research and a research associate for MONK (Metadata Offer New Knowledge at www.monkproject.org), a Mellon-funded project which seeks to integrate existing digital library collections and large-scale, cross-collection text mining and text analysis with rich visualization and social software capabilities.\r\r\n\r\r\nComing up @MITH 9/18, Chris Funkhouser (Dept. of Humanities, New Jersey Institute of Technology): \"Digital Poetry as Scrabble: Making From Given Materials\"\r\r\n\r\r\nView MITH's complete Fall Speakers Schedule <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100615144449/http://www.mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_fall_2007.pdf\">here</a>.\r\r\n\r\r\nAll talks free and open to the public!\r\r\n\r\r\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-8927).",

We are especially grateful to <strong>John Rink</strong> for his keynote lecture-recital “<em>(Not) Beyond the Score: Decoding Musical Performance</em>,” which highlighted the challenges of encoding/decoding music notation through the lens of performance research and practice.\n\n\n\nWe are also particularly grateful to <strong>Anna Kijas</strong> who, in her keynote speech, “<em>What does the data tell us?: Representation, Canon, and Music Encoding</em>,” highlighted critical topics that are too often neglected in the music encoding community. Her talk made the fundamental point that our acts of building digital representations of notated music can (and currently do) reinforce traditional canons of music history that overlook contributions by women and people of color. In establishing a “digital canon” we have an unprecedented opportunity to change this. <a href=\"https://medium.com/@kijas/https-medium-com-kijas-what-does-the-data-tell-us-926ba830702f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Read the full text of her keynote on Medium</a>.\n\n\n\nWe closed MEC with a productive <em>unconference</em> day in the MITH offices and we are happy to already see some activity on the Music Encoding Initiative community as a result!\n\n\n\n<img class=\"wp-image-19660 aligncenter\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_20180523_171713-669x272.jpg\" alt=\"Music Encoding Conference reception and performance with Brad Cohen and Tory Wood\" width=\"551\" height=\"224\" />\n\n\n\nMany thanks were given throughout the conference days; however, we would be remiss not to acknowledge again the support provided by the University of Maryland College of Arts and Humanities and the MEI Board for sponsored bursaries for students. This was especially important to allow students to attend the conference in a place that is currently geographically distant from the core constituencies of the MEI community. We are also thankful to Tido for sponsoring the Wednesday reception and particularly to soprano Tory Wood and Tido’s founder and director Brad Cohen for a wonderful live performance.\n\n\n\nWe enjoyed hosting our attendees at the beautiful Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center and are grateful to the wonderful team there: Leighann Yarwood, Amanda Lee Barber, Kara Warton, and their technical staff. Special thanks also to Lori Owen from the College of Arts and Humanities. We are also thankful for the students from the Performing Arts Library who manned the registration desk and helped with all odds and ends of the conference. They are: Jennifer Bonilla, Peter Franklin, Will Gray, Kimia Hesabi, Amarti Tasissa, Zachary Tumlin, Terriq White, and Barrett Wilbur.\n\n\n\nFinally, we are thankful to all who submitted contributions to the conference and to the Program Committee: Karen Desmond (chair), Johanna Devaney, David Fiala, Andrew Hankinson, and Maja Hartwig.",

In this post, MITH’s summer intern David Durden discusses his work on MITH’s audiovisual collection of historic Digital Dialogues events.</em>\n\n\n\nThe Digital Dialogues series showcases many prominent figures from the digital humanities community (e.g., Tara McPherson, Mark Sample, Trevor Owens, Julia Flanders, and MITH’s own Matthew Kirschenbaum) speaking about their research on digital culture, tools and methodologies, and the interlocking concerns of the humanities and computing.\n\n\n\nAs mentioned in my <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/decade-digital-dialogues-event-recordings-challenges-implementing-retroactive-digital-asset-management-plan/\">earlier post</a>, the nature of this collection presents several challenges to preservation and access as the series continues on into the future. As with many collections that are the focus of digital curation, the topics and subject matter covered in the Digital Dialogues continuously evolve and change over the course of the series. The collection itself is a record of the evolution of the digital humanities, the growth of MITH, and the rapid development of digital technologies, e.g., audio podcasts, multimedia podcasts, HD web hosted video.\n\n\n\nMy project was intended to help MITH balance the challenges of proper storage of existing content with the challenges of developing sustainable workflows for the dissemination of current and future content. Prior to this project, the Digital Dialogues collection was dispersed among several locations, representing different workflows, available technologies and access platforms over time. There have been 193 Digital Dialogues since September of 2005. There are recordings of 129 of these—78 recorded on video, and 51 recorded on audio (only). Access copies for videos and audio tracks were hosted in a variety of locations, such as Vimeo, Internet Archive, or an Amazon S3 server instance. Source and project files were located on a combination of the internal drive for MITH’s iMac video editing station, an external hard drive, and a separate local server. After the completion of this project, the preservation, storage and accessibility of all Digital Dialogues content has been streamlined. Source and project files are now organized in a set file directory structure and stored redundantly on two separate local drives, and all access copies are available through a single source—Vimeo—making it easier for users to have access to the entire collection. Due to weekly upload limits imposed by Vimeo, there are currently <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/album/2545093\">71 videos uploaded</a>, and 45 more videos are in the upload queue and will be available soon.\n\n\n\nOver the course of this project, I was involved in the processes of editing and exporting videos, updating the MITH site,, and preparing digital content for long-term storage, but through that process I did manage to find some time to actively engage with the sheer volume of content that exists within the collection. Several Digital Dialogues were in line with my own research interests and hobbies, so I was able to engage with the collection as both a curator and researcher, and watched these videos in their entirety.\n\n\n\nHere are a few (only a tiny sample) of my favorites:\n\n\n\n<a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/dialogues/dd-spring-2014-caetlin-benson-allott/\">Spectacular Stunts and Digital Detachment: Connecting Effects to Affects in US Car Movies, by Caetlin Benson-Allott</a>\n\n\n\n[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][fusion_builder_column type=\"1_1\" background_position=\"left top\" background_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" border_color=\"\" border_style=\"solid\" spacing=\"yes\" background_image=\"\" background_repeat=\"no-repeat\" padding=\"\" margin_top=\"0px\" margin_bottom=\"0px\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_direction=\"left\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" center_content=\"no\" min_height=\"none\"][fusion_code]PGlmcmFtZSBzcmM9Imh0dHBzOi8vcGxheWVyLnZpbWVvLmNvbS92aWRlby85MzI5MDIxMD9jb2xvcj1hZmJjMjEmdGl0bGU9MCZieWxpbmU9MCZwb3J0cmFpdD0wIiB3aWR0aD0iNjQwIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjM2MCIgZnJhbWVib3JkZXI9IjAiIHdlYmtpdGFsbG93ZnVsbHNjcmVlbiBtb3phbGxvd2Z1bGxzY3JlZW4gYWxsb3dmdWxsc2NyZWVuPjwvaWZyYW1lPg==[/fusion_code][fusion_separator style_type=\"none\" top_margin=\"\" bottom_margin=\"\" sep_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" icon=\"\" icon_circle=\"\" icon_circle_color=\"\" width=\"\" alignment=\"center\" class=\"\" id=\"\"/][fusion_text]\n\n\n\n<a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/dialogues/rachel-donahue-its-too-dangerous-to-go-alone-take-this/\">“It’s too Dangerous to Go Alone!

Take This.” Powering Up for Videogame Preservation</h3>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_17805\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<img class=\"wp-image-17805 size-medium\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Donahue-Title-Slide-300x226.jpg\" alt=\"Donahue Title Slide\" width=\"300\" height=\"226\" /> Title slide from Rachel Donahue’s Digital Dialogue[/caption]\n\n\n\nI am an avid fan and player of videogames, which is why I chose to highlight the talk in this video. Rachel Donahue worked on a Library of Congress-sponsored project, <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/research/pvwii/\">Preserving Virtual Worlds (PVW)</a>, which focused on the complexities of preserving the digital content of videogames (the Preserving Virtual Worlds website can only be viewed through the Internet Archive, but the <a href=\"http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/partners/pvw.html\">project report is available here</a>).\n\n\n\nDonahue’s talk explains the methodology devised by PVW to determine the ‘how’ and ‘why’ of videogame preservation, which isn’t as straightforward as I originally thought. She begins with a simple explanation of what it is exactly that PVW’s videogame preservation focused on: videogames that were originally for computer or dedicated consoles, such as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. This talk represents a wide range of preservation activities and approaches at the highest level. Donahue proceeds to explain that the problems inherent in videogame preservation stem from the existence of different preservation priorities from different members of the gaming community, e.g.: developers, players, and archivists. These sub-groups often overlap and further complicate the process. The player and developer communities may disagree about what the most important aspects of the game are, and in reference to the game Oregon Trail, Donahue states,\n\n<blockquote><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">“if you talk to a lot of people about the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Oregon Trail</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, and ask them ‘what do you most remember about the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Oregon Trail</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, what do you think is most important to the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Oregon Trail</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">?’, and they’re going to say things like, dysentery, trying to shoot squirrels, making it to Independence Rock before July 4th, fjording the river, having enough axles in your pack, having enough stuff in general without weighing down your oxen so much that they can’t move; maybe if you’re a little bit more observant you might think, ‘problematic portrayal of Native Americans,’ but you’re not going to say, ‘data model.’ I don’t think anybody thinks about the data model, but if you talk to the creators of the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Oregon Trail</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, they are in fact going to say, ‘the data model, the statistics, those are the most important parts of the game.”</span></blockquote>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_17804\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"450\"]<a href=\"https://mygeekwisdom.com/2016/06/11/you-have-died-of-dysentery/\"><img class=\"wp-image-17804 size-full\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Oregon-Trail.jpg\" alt=\"Oregon Trail\" width=\"450\" height=\"309\" /></a> Photo credit: mygeekwisdom.com[/caption]\n\n\n\nVideogames often have a multiplayer component that is a source of nostalgia for players. When comparing the gameplay between two-player <em>Super Mario Bros</em>., which can be preserved through software emulation or preservation of original hardware, to online play in <em>Halo 3</em>, which required servers operated by Microsoft in addition to the hardware and software components, one can quickly see how the ‘what’ of videogame preservation can imply drastically different things to groups within the community. Donahue also mentions that there are often unique trends and quirks for specific games within the player community which are not always preservable (such as <a href=\"https://wiki.sourceruns.org/wiki/Bunnyhopping\">‘bunny hopping’ in Quake</a>).\n\n\n\nA variety of questions must be answered before preservation activities can move forward. The most important question is: “what exactly are we preserving?” Aside from content, videogames are data, software, hardware, unique storage media, and peripherals such as controllers. Each element of a videogame system may require a specific skillset in order to achieve any sort of reliable preservation. In the case of hardware and circuit boards, basic knowledge of electronics and computer repair may be required; when using emulation, scripting skills will inevitably be required. Videogame preservation also demands a distinction to be made between original hardware preservation and software emulation--what is the minimum level of preservation for a videogame? The question of what to save is most certainly a philosophical one: is it the aesthetic of the original object and the experience of playing the game in its original state, or will any experience involving the loose entity of the game be acceptable?\n\n\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_17803\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<img class=\"wp-image-17803 size-full\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Retrode2-carts2-matted.png\" alt=\"Retrode\" width=\"300\" height=\"297\" /> The Retrode (retrode.org) is a device that allows for hardware emulation using original videogame cartridges.[/caption]\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Donahue exhibits several surveys created to gauge the focus of preservation activities. For the curator or archivist, survey questions were more technical, and a few examples are ‘can the game be played’, ‘do you have the equipment to emulate’, and ‘will you provide a complete videogame experience, or will you just preserve the artifacts?’ For players, the questions are more rooted in videogame culture, for example, ‘what is the core of the game and what does it mean’, ‘what contributes to the success of a franchise’, ‘what is the importance of multiplayer’, and ‘is this a good game or a milestone game’?</span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Donahue and the PVW project made great strides in articulating the specific needs of videogame preservation as well as providing the groundwork for establishing preservation standards for an often overlooked and misunderstood part of our culture.

    "wp post content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">MITH launched exciting curricular initiatives this past year, with the hiring of Purdom Lindblad as Assistant Director for Innovation and Learning and with </span><a href=\"https://mkirschenbaum.wordpress.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Matthew Kirschenbaum</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> taking on a new role as Director of the</span><a href=\"http://dsah.umd.edu/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Digital Studies in Arts and Humanities</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> (DSAH--pronounced DASH!) Graduate Certificate. These new activities complement MITH’s established role as a research institute and offer a preview of directions for our future work. </span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">DSAH offers graduate students a chance to combine the critical study of new forms of digital media and identity with creative and analytical practices utilizing digital media as well as the application of computational tools and techniques to traditional areas of humanistic study. All students complete two core courses: </span><b>MITH 610</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">,</span><a href=\"http://dsah.umd.edu/requirements/#introds\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Introduction to Digital Studies</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, the DSAH</span><a href=\"http://dsah.umd.edu/requirements/#colloquium\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Colloquium in Digital Studies,</span></a> <b>MITH 729</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, as well as a “praxis” course and other electives. MITH staff, </span><a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/people/person/raffaele-viglianti/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Raff</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, </span><a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/people/person/ed-summers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, and </span><a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/people/person/purdom-lindblad/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Purdom</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, have worked closely with Matt to develop and co-teach modules for MITH 610. These modules draw on the day-to-day work and expertise at MITH on topics such as TEI and scholarly editing, network analysis, and data storytelling.</span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">DSAH students, and any student interested in digital scholarship, have a myriad of opportunities to participate in the rich extra-curricular environment for digital studies at Maryland. These opportunities include the African American History, Culture, and Digital Humanities initiative,</span><a href=\"http://aadhum.umd.edu/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> AADHum</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, which features a</span><a href=\"http://aadhum.umd.edu/reading-groups/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> reading group</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and</span><a href=\"http://aadhum.umd.edu/dh-incubators/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Incubator series</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, MITH’s</span><a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/digital-dialogues/dialogues/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Digital Dialogues</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, and special events, such as the 2017</span><a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/sts2017/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Society for Textual Scholarship</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> conference. Matt says, \"The </span><a href=\"http://dsah.umd.edu/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">DSAH Certificate </span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">has already proven tremendously exciting and rewarding to direct. It represents an extremely diverse and talented intellectual community. It feels as if there's a real cohort there, which, together with the participants in AADHum, has been truly energizing.\" The current DSAH cohort come from English, Women's Studies, American Studies, Communication, Theatre/Performing Arts, and the iSchool, enriching interdisciplinary conversations while encouraging focused digital work within each student’s home discipline.</span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As one of the sponsors of DSAH, MITH is committed to providing another home base on campus for students working in digital studies. This year MITH hosted DSAH students collaborating on creative and experimental research. </span><a href=\"https://jeffreymoro.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Jeffrey Moro</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/setsukoyokoyama\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Setsuko Yokoyama</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, </span><a href=\"http://www.kylebickoff.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Kyle Bickoff</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, and </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tinbadthetailor\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Andy Yeh</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> recently presented their experimental research on 3D printing at the</span><a href=\"http://rcade.camden.rutgers.edu/2017symposium.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> 2017 R-CADE</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> symposium. Their panel, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Critical Unmaking:  DRM, Proprietary Networks, and Versioning Variances in 3-D Printing Technologies, </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">responds to a growing “blackboxing” of technology, and interrogates paths through which to productively break down and break open the 3-D printer across a variety of critical lenses and methodologies. Robert Burgard and Brittni Ballard spent the Spring semester pursuing a project titled \"</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A Conspiracy of Fake News: Linguistic Links between Fake News and Conspiracy Theory</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.\" The main goal is to ascertain whether a link exists between those who write fake news and those who write conspiracy theories. The project will examine rhetorical techniques found in both to determine any commonalities and will involve fieldwork and interviews with people working in various dis-information fields such as UFO sightings and Ghost Hunters. The objective is to produce a publishable paper as well as develop a tool to identify whatever linguistic links are revealed.</span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Beyond DSAH, Purdom is leading MITH’s expanding curricular initiatives, including MITH 388, Internship in Digital Humanities. The internship, now enrolling for Fall 2017, introduces students to the theory and practice of digital research either through a small project of their own or as contributors to existing MITH research initiatives. This year’s interns, Elliot Frank and Cooper Kidd, are contributing to</span><a href=\"http://www.docnow.io/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> DocNow</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Elliot is exploring the use of </span><a href=\"http://jupyter.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Jupyter notebooks</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> as a way to document how to collect and analyze data from the Twitter API. He is specifically looking at how to extract cliques of users within a specific individual’s social network to see if it can provide insight into a discipline such as the digital humanities. Cooper, worked through preliminary Python modules and is working on a sociological examination of learning a new technology. Cooper’s work will help MITH restructure ways of introducing students to technical skills.</span>\n\n\n\nWe’re excited to explore how these curricular initiatives can foster new and exciting work by our local community of students and faculty.\n\n\n\n&nbsp;",

    "wp post content": "<img src=\"http://www.newsdesk.umd.edu/images/MITH/Shakespeare/Hamlet1604.jpg\" alt=\"Hamlet in quarto\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLLEGE PARK, Md. - The University of Maryland's Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) will join national and international partners to create an innovative \"freely-accessible, high resolution\" digital interactive archive of William Shakespeare's pre-1641 quartos - living artifacts that tell the story of how Shakespeare's Hamlet, Henry V, King Lear, Midsummer Night's Dream, and Romeo and Juliet, to name just a few, first circulated in print.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The University of Maryland is thrilled to be part of this international collaboration to bring Shakespeare's works to life in a digital way,\" said University of Maryland President C. D. Mote, Jr. \"MITH has continually demonstrated the important role of technology in the humanities. This high-impact initiative will provide ready access to the Bard for scholars, students and the public alike.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe transatlantic digital collaboration is being made possible by grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and Britain's Higher Education Funding Council working though the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC). \"This is a truly collaborative project. Institutions in the U.S. and England will contribute digital images of their Shakespeare quartos, and the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities will provide the technology to allow scholars, students, and the public to analyze and compare these texts in an entirely new way,\" according to NEH Chairman Bruce Cole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C. will be the grant recipient for the collaborative in the United States, which includes MITH and the Huntington Library in California. The Folger holds the world's largest collection of Shakespeare's quartos. \"The Shakespeare Quartos Archive heralds the future of textual studies, bringing these rare early texts out of their separate archives and onto the screens of individual scholars,\" says Folger Director Gail Kern Paster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nearly $120,000 NEH grant will provide initial funds for one year to create a technical proof of concept \"working model\" for the project by digitizing all 32 pre-1641 versions of Hamlet held by the participating libraries. \"The JISC/NEH initiative gave us the opportunity and the incentive to attempt a truly international, collaborative, digital project,\" says Folger Project Director Richard Kuhta. \"The guidelines challenged us to think collectively about what was possible, and to realize a shared ambition. It was exactly the prompt we needed to launch a conversation that transformed geographically distant collections into partner institutions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEH Chairman Cole announced the Shakespeare Quartos Archive grant during a news conference Tuesday (March 25) at the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C.\r\n\r\n<strong>\r\n\r\nThe Shakespeare Quartos</strong>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMITH Director Neil Fraistat says \"The quartos themselves offer crucial evidence about what actually was performed\" by Shakespeare's troupe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause Shakespeare himself did not authorize a printed edition of his plays, what was published at the time represented what others heard, memorized or took from the marked-up \"foul papers\" of a particular production. The quartos were essentially paperbacks produced soon after a play was produced and were meant to be read and thrown away. Fraistat uses the example of Hamlet's most famous soliloquy to show how different the published versions were:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Be or Not To Be, That is the Question.\r\n\r\nWhether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer\r\n\r\nThe slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,\r\n\r\nOr to take arms against a sea of troubles.\r\n\r\n- Hamlet Quarto 2 1604/5\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo be, or not to be, ay there's the point,\r\n\r\nTo die, to sleep,, is that all? Ay all:\r\n\r\nNo, to sleep, to dream, ay marry there it goes...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Hamlet Quarto 1 1603\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFraistat estimates that it will take approximately three years after completion of the working model to complete the project for the remaining Shakespeare quartos. MITH's interactive site will ultimately be housed at Oxford University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe British Museum's Shakespeare in Quarto website will house the new interactive quarto website.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother exciting aspect of the project is that Washington-area high school teachers will be able to provide their feedback to the project as it progresses. \"We also have one other partner in this grant - the Shakespeare Institute, which is in Stratford, but based from the University of Birmingham. Their teachers, scholars and students will also be working with the prototype giving us feedback and functionality about what they'd like to see,\" Fraistat says.

Tanya's dissertation, The Making of Digital Modernism: Re-reading Modernist Texts with Computer-Assisted Analysis, is genuinely groundbreaking and will contribute new readings and new knowledge to the scholarship on Gertrude Stein as well as a lesser-known figure, the Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven (who was pivotal in the American Dadaist movement). By using a wide range of computational tools and techniques, ranging from text encoding to text mining and visualization, Clement's project is a bracing demonstration of just how completely our readings and understandings of complex literary work can be reconfigured with the intervention of new media.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClement says, \"I am very excited to receive the Winnemore fellowship and start my residency at MITH this semester. Support from MITH provides for an essential combination of practice and theory that ensures my dissertation research in humanities computing and literature will be both productive and ahead-of-the-curve.\" She adds, \"This semester, I will create an electronic sampling of poetry from the manuscripts of dadaist poet Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven. I will use current encoding standards while also augmenting the Versioning Machine (http://v-machine.org/), an open-source tool used for visualizing textual variants. As a result, I will explore the possibility that a digital edition could invigorate scholarly interest in her poetry and the extent to which digital methods meant to facilitate humanist inquiry are still challenged by the difficult work literary study engages.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClement's dissertation is directed by Matthew Kirschenbaum.",

    "wp post content": "Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is over, and it’s time to recap what has been done during a greatly productive summer. Not only has my project has achieved its main objectives, but as a result I was able to demonstrate the results at the <a href=\"http://duchemin.haverford.edu/editorsforum/ecole-thematique-2013/\">École Thématique</a>, Centre d’Étude Supérieures de la Renaissance in Tours, France in late October.\n\n\n\nFor readers not familiar with the project, <a href=\"https://github.com/TEI-Music-SIG/MEItoVexFlow\"><i>MEI to VexFlow</i></a> is a web-based software component that allows web browsers to display music notation stored in the so-called <a href=\"http://music-encoding.org/\">MEI (Musi</a><a href=\"http://music-encoding.org/\">c Encoding Initiative</a>) format. For more information about the project, see my <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/mei-to-vexflow/\">initial</a> and <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/mei-to-vexflow/\">mid-term</a> posts.\n\n\n\nHistorical musical pieces make their way to us through multiple documents and it often happens that multiple sources introduce differences and variants in the music. As the final task of the GSoC project, I designed a sample web application called <a href=\"http://zolaemil.github.io/meiView\">meiView</a> that is be able to display 15–16<sup>th</sup> century music (more precisely, the transcription of such music into common western music notation), and provide a dynamic mechanism for the user to select which variant they want to see.\n\n\n\nTo see it working, open <a href=\"http://zolaemil.github.io/meiView\">meiView</a>, and click on the green dots to see the differences between the sources. In the sidebar you can see the highlighted sources and variants you have selected. When you select a variant, the score automatically updates so that the selected variant is displayed.\n\n\n\n<b>Overview</b>\n\n\n\nMEI is an XML format that is able to represent differences between various sources, so I wanted to create an application that presented the textual ambiguities visually. When visualizing the ambiguities, depending on the purpose of the application, there are a number of ways to approach the problem. For example if a user is making a comprehensive textual study of the score, it may be desirable that they can look at all the variants simultaneously (just like in the <a href=\"http://www.ocve.org.uk/jsp/browse.jsp\">Chopin Variorum Edition</a>, where it is possible to look at a measure and see the scanned images of all the different editions at the same time). When focusing on performing practice, the preference is to keep the score as integrated and uncluttered as possible. I am very much interested in studying the latter approach, and therefore decided that the score should always display the music as it was from a single source. However thanks to its dynamic nature, the user can “customize” the score by selecting, for instance, source A at measure three and source B at measure five.\n\n\n\nThe MEI format allows editors to compile all musical information, including the differences between the sources, into a single XML file. Music editors, after thorough scholarly research, often chose to establish a “base text”, that is, a text that, according to their best judgment, is the most authentic or the most acceptable. The base text is also stored in the MEI file.\n\n\n\nTo start with, meiView renders the base text using MEI-to-VexFlow. Then it displays little green dots where different variants are available (Figure 1).\n\n\n\n[fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=\"yes\" overflow=\"visible\"][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=\"1_1\" background_position=\"left top\" background_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" border_color=\"\" border_style=\"solid\" spacing=\"yes\" background_image=\"\" background_repeat=\"no-repeat\" padding=\"\" margin_top=\"0px\" margin_bottom=\"0px\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_direction=\"left\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" center_content=\"no\" min_height=\"none\"][caption id=\"attachment_11546\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"225\"]<a href=\" http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/GSoC-Final-Blog-Post-Figure-1.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-11546 \" src=\" http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/GSoC-Final-Blog-Post-Figure-1.png\" alt=\"Figure 1: Base text displayed, and green dots mark the measures where some of the sources contain differences.\" width=\"225\" height=\"157\" /></a> Figure 1: Base text displayed, and green dots mark the measures where some of the sources contain differences.[/caption]\n\n\n\nYou can replace fragments of the musical text, by clicking on the green dots and selecting another variant.\n\n\n\n[/fusion_builder_column][fusion_builder_column type=\"1_1\" background_position=\"left top\" background_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" border_color=\"\" border_style=\"solid\" spacing=\"yes\" background_image=\"\" background_repeat=\"no-repeat\" padding=\"\" margin_top=\"0px\" margin_bottom=\"0px\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_direction=\"left\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" center_content=\"no\" min_height=\"none\"][caption id=\"attachment_11547\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"225\"]<a href=\" http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/GSoC-Final-Blog-Post-Figure-2.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-11547 \" src=\" http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/GSoC-Final-Blog-Post-Figure-2.png\" alt=\"Figure 2: Replacing a fragment of the musical text with a variant.\" width=\"225\" height=\"163\" /></a> Figure 2: Replacing a fragment of the musical text with a variant.[/caption]\n\n\n\nIn some cases, one source is different from all others, while all other sources agree.

It is an extremely powerful feature compared to printed music.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, allowing an arbitrary combination of sources brings us to new challenges. When a semantically closely related set of differences is encoded by a number of differences in the MEI (e.g. a two-syllable word difference in lyrics is represented by two differences in MEI) it makes no sense to choose an arbitrary combination of sources. For this reason meiView currently doesn’t show differences in lyrics and it only displays local variants. That is, differences that don’t span across barlines, or if they do, they are split into multiple differences. You can check out an example of this at <a href=\"http://zolaemil.github.io/meiView/index.html#score&amp;pg=3\">page 3</a> measure 3-4. Note that the ties don’t generally cause problems, because in more simple cases they can be encoded as a single element, therefore the difference only concerns the measure containing that element, see for instance <a href=\"http://zolaemil.github.io/meiView/index.html#score&amp;pg=1\">page 1</a> measure 3. Fortunately, there are plans to overcome this problem by allowing the music editors to specify which combination of variants are possible and limit user options accordingly.\n\n\n\nThis project has demonstrated some of the potential of the MEI format to musicians and music scholars. According to the feedback from the participants at the <a href=\"http://duchemin.haverford.edu/editorsforum/ecole-thematique-2013/\">École Thématique</a> in Tours, there’s great interest in taking MEI-to-VexFlow and meiView even further. The application will be integrated into the <a href=\"http://duchemin.haverford.edu/\">Digital Du Chemin</a> platform.\n\n\n\n<b>Acknowledgements</b>\n\n\n\nI feel lucky for having been able to participate in this project, which was made possible by the Google Summer of Code program and Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities at theUniversity of Maryland. Also, I would like to thank my project mentor Raffaele Viglianti who provided fantastic support, and David Lee from University of Glasgow (UK) for providing me with the musical material.\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n&nbsp;[/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]",

The compendium reveals recent declines in voluntary reading and test scores alike, exposing trends that have severe consequences for American society. Like its controversial predecessor, Reading at Risk (2004), the new report has provoked a widespread debate with recent coverage in such outlets at the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, and the Guardian. SUNIL IYENGAR, one of the primary architects of the report, will present an overview of its findings and take questions about its methodology and conclusions.\r\n\r\nSUNIL IYENGAR directs the Office of Research and Analysis at the National Endowment for the Arts. In November 2007, Mr. Iyengar's office released To Read or Not To Read: A Question of National Consequence, a new and comprehensive analysis of reading patterns in the United States. He also manages a national evaluation project for the Big Read. The Office of Research and Analysis is responsible for the U.S. Survey of Public Participation in the Arts and for routine dissemination of research notes on various arts topics ranging from performing artist income trends to classical music radio program access.\r\n\r\nHis book reviews have appeared in publications such as The Washington Post, New York Times, San Francisco Chronicle, The American Scholar, The New Criterion, and Contemporary Poetry Review.  He was a board member of the American Poetry &amp; Literacy Project, co-founded by Andrew Carroll and the late Joseph Brodsky. Mr. Iyengar earned his B.A. in English from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.\r\n\r\nNOTE: because of the size of our seminar room, we regret that we cannot accommodate entire classes.\r\n\r\nComing up @MITH 4/8: John Carlson's talk has been cancelled.

Although Roxie's World is a blog written by an academic, it is not an \"academic blog\" in the usual sense. It is a creative experiment in punditry, topical humor, and cultural commentary offered in the voice of a 13-year-old wire-haired fox terrier\"”Roxie\"”who has a leaky heart and a laptop. Roxie's major preoccupations are politics, pop culture, and basketball. Her stance is that of a dogged progressive fascinated by the queer doings of Homo sapiens. Though Roxie is a purebred, Lindemann's lecture is a mongrel mixture of critical reflection on her own practices as a blogger and analysis of what blogging can teach us about reading, writing, and social networking in the twenty-first century. Situated at the intersection of canine cultural studies, queer/feminist studies, and an emerging discourse of blog studies, the presentation takes up issues of persona, parody, and irony in connection with a post-9/11 politics of dissent; of building and tracking real and imagined audiences in the blogosphere; of the complex role played by words, images, and sound in the grammar and in the world-making aspirations of blogs; and of satirical self-publication as a healthy response to the conditions of academic work under late capitalism.\r\n\r\nMARILEE LINDEMANN is an Associate Professor in the Department of English and the Director of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Studies Program at the University of Maryland. She is the author of Willa Cather: Queering America (Columbia University Press, 1999) and the editor of The Cambridge Companion to Willa Cather (Cambridge University Press, 2005). She also edited Cather's Alexander's Bridge (1997) and O Pioneers! (1999) for Oxford University Press. Her writing has appeared in several anthologies of criticism and in American Literary History, The Harvard Gay and Lesbian Review, The Gay and Lesbian Literary Heritage, and the Willa Cather Pioneer Memorial Newsletter. She is also the author of the blog, Roxie's World (http://roxies-world.blogspot.com/), where she writes in the persona of Roxie Smith Lindemann, a 13-year-old wire-haired fox terrier she shares with her partner.\r\n\r\nComing up @MITH: February 12, The Gamers Symphony Orchestra: A Discussion and Performance!\r\n\r\nMITH's complete Spring Speakers Schedule will be posted very soon.\r\n\r\nAll talks free and open to the public!\r\n\r\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-8927).",

In this first installment, doctoral candidates ASIM ALI (American Studies) and MARC RUPPEL (English) share recent work presented at national conferences in their field for which they received MITH Travel Grants. Join us this time for a heady brew of Buffy, Batman, readers, fans, new media, narrative, and religion.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Religion, Internet Fandom, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer\"\r\r\n\r\r\nAsim Ali\r\r\n\r\r\nIn this presentation, I will discuss the mediated interaction of popular culture and religion. I will focus in particular on fans of the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer; this presentation will be based on my ethnographic analysis of that particular group of fans who frequented the official Buffy internet fan site known as The Bronze. There are several ways in which Buffy and religion interact. First, the show is replete with religious references and imagery, and reflects the critical perspective of creator Joss Whedon, an avowed atheist who apparently had few qualms about criticizing religion via Buffy. However, fan interpretations of the religious symbolism in Buffy are often contradictory and contested. Second, not only is there religion in Buffy, but Buffy itself can be seen as a religion. Whedon is the creator of a founding mythology, which he and his production staff--similar to a hierarchically organized clergy--canonized via Buffy. Furthermore, there are several institutions--analogous to a hierarchical laity, of which The Bronze, being officially sanctioned, is at the top--through which the text is interpreted and modified. Third, even though The Bronze is now defunct, the community lives on through several internet sites. Although The Bronze is fragmented and the community no longer has a central location or unifying concept, it maintains its cohesion through a matrix of connections based on the common bond of having been a Bronzer. In this sense, it functions much like a global religious community.\r\r\n\r\r\nASIM ALI is a doctoral candidate in American Studies. His research interests include; race and slavery; religion; and new media. He is currently director of the Project on Religion, Culture, and Globalization.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Idealized Stories, Idealized Readers and Idealized Consumers: Batman Begins and the New Narrative Model\"\r\r\n\r\r\nMarc Ruppel\r\r\n\r\r\nIn her recent article \"Narrative and Digitality\" (2005), Marie-Laure Ryan describes what she calls texts that think with their medium. These texts possess properties of interactivity/ reactivity, variability, multi-sensorality and networking capabilities. Unique to these sorts of texts is the \"ability to create an original experience which cannot be duplicated by any other medium, an experience which makes the medium seem truly necessary\" (516). Keeping this distinction in mind, this talk will argue that convergent corporate organizations are enabling a new kind of story structure, a cross-sited narrative, that not only implicates the reader/user/viewer in the active construction of an ideal narrative (one that exists as the product of a blending of several variant stories), but also forces an assimilation of the medial \"thoughts\" of a particular channel. Using the film and video game adaptations of Batman Begins as prototypical examples of cross-siting, I will discuss the ways that the structure of the Time Warner Corporation directly influences the form(s) of the dispersed narrative, and posit that the synergy so often sought within this sort of venture ends up vastly complicating issues of authorship, framing and continuity, leading to a shift from a Barthesian idealized reader to something more akin to an idealized consumer. Consequently, instead of narrative being contingent upon a single medium with an isolated set of \"thoughts\", we need to begin talking about an idealized narrative with multiple medialities, one that exists in both local material and non-material \"in-between\"Ã‚Â states of meaning.\r\r\n\r\r\nMARC RUPPEL is a doctoral candidate in English, working on a dissertation on cross-sited narrative. His research interests include digital studies, popular culture, and Native American literature.\r\r\n\r\r\nComing up @MITH: Workshop on Scholarly Electronic Publishing (March 29) and on April 4, Ralph Bauer (Associate Professor, English): \"The Early Americas Digital Archive; and \"Marlene Mayo (Associate Professor, History): \"Gender, Class, and Race in Occupied Japan.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nView MITH's complete Spring Speakers Schedule here:\r\r\n\r\r\n&nbsp;\r\r\n\r\r\n&nbsp;\r\r\n\r\r\n<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100609001120/http://mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_spring_2006.pdf\">http://mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_spring_2006.pdf</a>\r\r\n\r\r\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Acting Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-5896).",

THATCamp has become an annual unconference hosted by GMU, and inspired regional digital humanities unconferences in France, Texas, Michigan, Ohio, and California. Lester will also draw from his experience engaging existing communities of interest through social networking sites to discuss the changing landscape of crowdsourcing and suggest ways that digital humanists can engage the public to answer research questions.\n\nDAVE LESTER, Assistant Director of MITH, has previously been employed by George Mason University’s Center for History &amp; New Media where he coordinated software development outreach for the Omeka Web publishing system used by libraries, museums, and archives. He was responsible for prototyping mobile applications for museums, fostering a collaborative open source community, and co-organizing THATCamp, an annual Digital Humanities “unconference” bringing together practitioners to collaborate and share their work. Prior to Mason, Dave was a Crossroads Fellow at Georgetown University’s Center for New Designs in Learning &amp; Scholarship, and helped redevelop the American Studies Crossroads Project Web site. He is also a HASTAC scholar, and his ongoing research focuses on place-based computing and the engagement of the public in crowdsourcing local history.\n\nComing up @MITH: There are no further talks scheduled until after Spring Break as we anticipate presentations from candidates visiting campus for the College of Arts and Humanities cluster search in Digital Humanities, Media, and Culture.\n\nView MITH's complete Fall Speakers Schedule here:\n\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20100608231200/http://www.mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_spring_2010.pdf\n\nAll talks free and open to the public!\n\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-8927).",

In collaboration with HTRC, MITH will develop a prototype application to facilitate the distributed correction and enhancement of HathiTrust metadata records.\n\nThis work builds directly on several previous MITH projects, including a system for HathiTrust metadata correction developed by Travis Brown, MITH Assistant Director of Research and Development, as part of a partnership between MITH and the <a href=\"http://prosody.princeton.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Princeton Prosody Archive</a>, as well as work with Faculty Fellow Peter Mallios and the <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/research/fla/\">Foreign Literatures in America</a> (FLA) team. We are excited to be pushing this work forward in ways that will help make the HathiTrust an increasingly useful resource for scholars.\n\nAs part of this new project, MITH will continue to collaborate with Mallios and the FLA team to develop a set of services and interfaces that will allow the FLA project (and other projects like it) to pull metadata records from the HathiTrust, correct and annotate these records using standardized vocabularies, gather corrections and annotations from other teams or scholars, and export enhanced metadata in formats suitable for publication as linked data. The design of this prototype application is intended to leverage the effort of scholars as they identify and select relevant resources from the HathiTrust corpus to create collections (“worksets”) useful for scholarly analyses. Mallios and the FLA team will experiment with using the prototype to continue their work studying the reception of foreign and immigrant authored literary works in the U.S., in interdisciplinary terms that encompass literature, culture, politics, history, and international relations. The MITH team will include Research Programmer Raffaele Viglianti and Project Manager Stephanie Sapienza, as well as Project Director Trevor Muñoz.\n\nThe HathiTrust Research Center's Workset Creation for Scholarly Analysis: Prototyping Project (WCSA) is a two-year effort, funded by the <a title=\"Andrew W. Mellon Foundation\" href=\"http://mellon.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</a>, which aims to engage scholars in designing tools for exploration, location, and analytic grouping of materials so they can routinely conduct computational scholarship at scale, based on meaningful worksets.\n\nFor more information, please contact Trevor Muñoz.",

We are working to improve the timeline, but for now, the lines above the dots (which are sized according to how many materials are in the collection) indicate how these stories reappear over time. We want to visualize how these stories drop out of conversations or how often they are referenced.\n\n\n\nThe Take Back the Archive project explores experimental interfaces including Rich Prospect Browsing as outlined in <a href=\"https://www.id.iit.edu/artifacts/visual-interface-design-for-digital-cultural-heritage/\">Visual Interface Design for Digital Cultural Heritage</a>. We used Rich Prospect Browsing as an element of transparency and poly-vocalism to show the extent of the collected materials for the archive, as well as a quick way of identifying the type of content. In this case, materials were designated as advocacy materials, policy reports, and journalistic accounts. Rich Prospect Browsing offers options for representing the full scope of materials with the goal of empowering users to understand the varied paths through the archival materials, that there is not one story, but many represented within. A major challenge to transparency is the ability to visualize absence--we know that many people do not report, particularly men and people from the LGBT community, so their stories do not appear in the archive. Can we better represent absence of materials to signal that this archive is incomplete or not fully representational?\n\n\n\nShowing every item within the collection additionally resists embedding assumptions of rank and relevance in search algorithms, namely that the most commonly asserted statements must be true. Sadler and Bourg point out that ‘search algorithms represent a single majority-rules point of view, masquerading as neutrality; which does not render visible how the system has been designed for an “ideal user.” Further, the documentation and research determining the characteristics of that ideal user are not shared with others.\n\n\n\nI lean on Safiya Noble’s work on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2d2I_ZSN1U\">Biased Data</a> which explores the ways search algorithms reflect racism. She writes ”when we talk about these kinds of racist experiences and pointers that happen in technical systems, we also hear in the public discourse these things talked about, again, as anomalies, as glitches, rather than helping us understand and unveil the ways that programmers are people who write, and code is a language. And all languages are value-laden, including binary code languages.”\n\n\n\nNobel writes ”when we talk about these kinds of racist experiences and pointers that happen in technical systems, we also hear in the public discourse these things talked about, again, as anomalies, as glitches, rather than helping us understand and unveil the ways that programmers are people who write, and code is a language. And all languages are value-laden, including binary code languages.”\n\n\n\nFor the <a href=\"http://dhtraining.org/hilt/course/depostcolonial-digital-humanities/\">De/Post/Colonial Digital Humanities course at HILT 2015</a>, Roopika Risam and Micha Cardenas collaborated with participants to develop a resource for designing digital humanities research with demonstrated commitments to social justice. 11 participants shared their work publicly with an explicit invitation for others to contribute prompts and resources around<strong> access, material conditions, methods, ontologies and epistemologies</strong> that shape digital humanities. In their words, “The goal here is to make visible the critical and theoretical processes that subtend digital humanities practices.”\n\n\n\nThe site contains prompts, such as “How accessible is the project for people with disabilities?” “How accessible is the project in low-bandwidth environments?” “Which archives does the project use?” and “Whose voices are absent from these archives?” alongside links to practitioners and resources engaged with the issues around a particular prompt.\n\n\n\nUsers are able to comment at sentence, paragraph, or section level, extending a conversation about practice beyond the local and temporally located working group. The goal here is not to stagnate or stall a project, rather to slow down and reflect upon the ethical choices needed in the creation of digital work. The goal is to break these choices down to manageable, addressable parts. As Amy Wickner observed, <strong>Ethical tensions are addressable. While ethical considerations need to be at the center of our work, they need not prohibit this work from progressing.</strong>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://africandiasporaphd.com/\">African Diaspora PhD</a>, led by Jessica Marie Johnson, Kidada Williams, and Ana-Lucia Araujo—uses tagging and clear licensing information as well as multiple entry points into content, as examples of elements of the principle of transparency. The team page does a great job of showcasing who is contributing to the various pieces of the project, highlighting shared credit as an element of collaboration.\n\n\n\nCollaboration here, as in the next example, <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/research/documenting-the-now-supporting-scholarly-use-and-preservation-of-social-media-content/\">Documenting the Now</a>, can be very useful when thinking about the library. <strong>What does collaboration look like and mean within the library?</strong> Particularly for liaison librarians, but also for all throughout the library, we can include a Collaborator’s Bill of Rights or other documents to make visible our expectations, skills, and constraints when we collaborate. Making shared credit something actionable for our work.\n\n\n\nDocumenting the Now does a fantastic job at communicating technical infrastructure and project decisions through a variety of platforms, from newsletters to a Slack Channel to GitHub, all elements of transparency.\n\n\n\nFurther, Documenting the Now builds tools alongside the community of activists, scholars, researchers, and interested public so users are able to manage their own data and representation. Christina Harlow points to DocNow as a model for library and information professionals in opening our work of selecting, curating, and managing data and tools to the very users who are best positioned to shape and improve these practices.\n\n\n\n[/fusion_text][fusion_imageframe image_id=\"19299\" style_type=\"none\" stylecolor=\"\" hover_type=\"none\" bordersize=\"\" bordercolor=\"\" borderradius=\"\" align=\"center\" lightbox=\"yes\" gallery_id=\"gallery\" lightbox_image=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/transforming-dh.png\" alt=\"Transform(ing)Dh\" link=\"\" linktarget=\"_self\" hide_on_mobile=\"small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_direction=\"left\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_offset=\"\"]http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/transforming-dh-980x609.png[/fusion_imageframe][fusion_text]\n\n\n\nCollecting in collaboration with communities is slower, more complicated, yet this practice can support our reflection on biases inherent within traditional collecting policies, particularly who decides what is valuable, worth of collecting and preserving and therefore status, funding, and place within the archive. <em>It also means we must address what collaboration looks like and mean within the library, particularly attention to what power structures are inherent and tacit within collaborations?</em> Ed Summers, co-PI of <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/research/documenting-the-now-supporting-scholarly-use-and-preservation-of-social-media-content/\">Doc Now</a>, indicates that collaboration can be a source of tension-but this tension is vital because the project has a responsibility to work with communities to insure people are authentically represented, <strong>or not</strong>, within the archive.\n\n\n\n[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]",

    "wp post content": "In a <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/digging-into-data-with-topic-models/\" target=\"_blank\">recent post</a> to this blog, Sayan Bhattacharyya described his contributions to the <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/corporacamp/tool.php\" target=\"_blank\">Woodchipper</a> project in the context of a broader discussion about corpus-based approaches to humanities research. Topic modeling, the statistical technology undergirding Woodchipper, has garnered increasing attention as a tool of hermeneutic empowerment, a method for drawing structure out of a corpus on the basis of minimal critical presuppositions. In this post I map out a basic genealogy of topic modeling in the humanities, from the highly cited paper that first articulated Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to recent work at MITH.\n\n<strong>The Story of Topic Modeling</strong>\n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CCcQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cs.princeton.edu%2F~blei%2Fpapers%2FBleiNgJordan2003.pdf&amp;rct=j&amp;q=blei%20ng%202003%20topic%20modeling&amp;ei=Jrs2TtuGG-S50AHG_cj3Cw&amp;usg=AFQjCNEGsYCPJ8IZk9Y4xKeIS6WCKUeO-A&amp;sig2=Daec-QOPp6uZnxCp841icg&amp;cad=rja\" target=\"_blank\">original LDA topic modeling paper</a>, the one that defined the field, was published by Blei, Ng, and Jordan in 2003. The basic story is one of assumptions, and it goes like this: First, assume that each document is made up of a random mixture of categories, or topics. Now, suppose each category is defined by its preference for some words over others. Finally, let's pretend we're going to generate each word in each document from scratch. Over and over again, we randomly choose a category, then we randomly choose a word based on the preferences of that category.\n\nObviously the corpus wasn't actually generated this way. Barring cyborg intervention, it was probably written down by a person or group of people. However, topic modeling calls on us to suspend our disbelief. Let's just suppose the corpus was generated entirely through this process. Then, given that the corpus is what it is, what are the most likely underlying affinities between words and between categories? Topic modeling infers a plausible answer under the assumption that the “generative story” I told a paragraph ago is true.\n\nSkepticism is warranted, but the proof of the pudding is that it can be quite nice. As an aside to <a href=\"http://historying.org/2010/04/01/topic-modeling-martha-ballards-diary/\" target=\"_blank\">his work modeling Martha Ballard's diary</a>, Cameron Blevins (Ph.D. candidate in American History, Stanford University) offers frank acknowledgment that a newcomer can benefit from topic modeling by using a standard toolkit like <a href=\"http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">MALLET</a> (developed by University of Massachusetts-Amherst): \"I don’t pretend to have a firm grasp on the inner statistical/computational plumbing of how MALLET produces these topics, but in the case of Martha Ballard’s diary, it worked. Beautifully.\"\n\nA tool like MALLET gives a sense of the relative importance of topics in the composition of each document, as well as a list of the most prominent words in each topic. The word lists define the topics – it's up to practitioners to discern meaning in the topics and to give them names. For example, Blevins identifies the theme of “housework” in two topics, and then shows that the prevalence of these topics in the corpus increases over the life-span of Martha Ballard's diary. Although a correlation between housework and age might seem counterintuitive, it turns out to corroborate the definitive critical commentary on the diary.\n\nIn this or similar fashion, the “topic proportions” assigned to each document are often used, in conjunction with topic word lists, to draw comparative insights about a corpus. Boundary lines are drawn around document subsets and topic proportions are aggregated within each piece of territory. In chronological applications like Blevins' study of the diary, it is often advantageous to draw boundary lines in time. <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20120417131033/http://www.pnas.org:80/content/101/suppl.1/5228.full.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Griffiths and Steyvers (2004)</a> illustrate how to register temporal changes in topic composition using the output from basic LDA. <a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~newman/pubs/JASIST_Newman.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Newman and Block (2006)</a>'s work with the 18th century <em>Pennsylvania Gazette</em> corpus was perhaps the first diachronic application of topic modeling in the humanities.\n\n<strong>Into a DH Frame: Graphs, Maps, and Trees</strong>\n\nApplications of topic modeling in the digital humanities are sometimes framed within a “distant reading” paradigm, for which Franco Moretti's Graphs, Maps, Trees (2005) is the key text. Robert K. Nelson, director of the Digital Scholarship Lab and author of the <a href=\"http://dsl.richmond.edu/dispatch/pages/intro\" target=\"_blank\">Mining the Dispatch</a> project, explains that “the real potential of topic modeling . . . isn't at the level of the individual document. Topic modeling, instead, allows us to step back from individual documents and look at larger patterns among all the documents, to practice not close but distant reading, to borrow [fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=\"yes\" overflow=\"visible\"][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=\"1_1\" background_position=\"left top\" background_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" border_color=\"\" border_style=\"solid\" spacing=\"yes\" background_image=\"\" background_repeat=\"no-repeat\" padding=\"\" margin_top=\"0px\" margin_bottom=\"0px\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_direction=\"left\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" center_content=\"no\" min_height=\"none\"][Moretti's] memorable phrase.” In his <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/digging-into-data-with-topic-models/\" target=\"_blank\">recent post</a> on this blog, my fellow MITH intern Sayan Bhattacharyya motivates interface enhancements to the Woodchipper project by appealing to the interplay of distant and close reading. In general, the Woodchipper project aims to facilitate a seamless interpretive experience that toggles between multiple levels of engagement with a corpus of texts.\n\n<strong>Five Elements of Topic Modeling Projects</strong>\n\nIn <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20111211124523/http://www.stanford.edu:80/~mjockers/cgi-bin/drupal/node/39\" target=\"_blank\">one of the earliest impulses</a> in the current wave of humanities topic modeling, Matthew Jockers (Stanford University) modeled a corpus of blogs generated during the “Day of DH”, a “community publication project that [brought] together digital humanists from around the world to document what they do on one day.” In Jockers' methodology, I identify five elements needed to communicate the story of a topic modeling project:\n\nCorpus\nTechnique\nUnit of Analysis\nPost Processing\nVisualization\n\nFor Jockers' project, these elements (potentially, descriptive metadata elements in a future registry or repository of Bayesian DH projects) are populated as follows:\n\n<strong>Corpus</strong>: Day of DH Blog posts\n<strong>Technique</strong>: vanilla LDA using MALLET\n<strong>Unit of analysis</strong>: Blog (all the posts on a single blog)\n<strong>Post Processing</strong>: \"With a little massaging in R, I read in the matrix and then use some simple distance and clustering functions to group the bloggers into 10 (again an arbitrary number) groups; groups based on shared themes.\"\n<strong>Visualization</strong>: \"I then output a matrix showing which authors have the most in common.\"\n\n<strong>A Catalogue of DH Topic Modeling Projects</strong>\n\nAs I hinted before, a distinction between diachronic and synchronic units of analysis seems feasible. It also turns out to be an efficacious organizer for a directory of DH projects. Jockers' “Day of DH” project, based on the blog as unit of analysis, happens to be synchronic; earlier, Newman and Block's time-bound approach to colonial newspapers was diachronic. The distinction structures this open list of DH topic modeling projects:\n\n<strong>Synchronic approaches</strong> (Unit of analysis is not time bound)\n<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20111211124523/http://www.stanford.edu:80/~mjockers/cgi-bin/drupal/node/39\" target=\"_blank\">Matthew Jockers' work</a> on the Day of DH blog posts (2010).\n<a href=\"https://dhs.stanford.edu/comprehending-the-digital-humanities/\" target=\"_blank\">Elijah Meeks' work</a> on self-definitions of digital humanists (2011).\n<a href=\"//dhs.stanford.edu/algorithmic-literacy/topic-networks-in-proust/\" target=\"_blank\">Jeff Druin's work</a> on Proust (2011).\n<a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/corporacamp/tool.php\" target=\"_blank\">Travis Brown's work</a> on Jane Austen's <em>Emma</em> and and Byron's <em>Don Juan</em> (2011).\n\n<strong>Diachronic Approaches</strong> (Unit of analysis is a time slice)\n<a href=\"http://www.ics.uci.edu/~newman/pubs/JASIST_Newman.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Block and Newman's work</a> on the <em>Pennsylvania Gazette</em> (2006).\n<a href=\"http://historying.org/2010/04/01/topic-modeling-martha-ballards-diary/\" target=\"_blank\">Cameron Blevins' work</a> on Martha Ballard's diary (2010).\n<a href=\"http://dsl.richmond.edu/dispatch/pages/intro\" target=\"_blank\">Robert K. Nelson's work</a> on the <em>Richmond Daily Dispatch</em> corpus (2011).\n<a href=\"http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W/W11/W11-15.pdf#page=108\" target=\"_blank\">Yang, Torget, and Mihalcea's work</a> on Texas newspapers (2011).\n\nOne might expect this directory to expand rapidly as practitioners enter the field and new techniques are imported from Natural Language Processing (NLP) into the DH community.\n\nIn this post I have tried to draw out the unique value of LDA topic modeling as a text mining technique in the humanities, and to identify significant landmarks in the field. In future posts, I will begin incorporating topic modeling approaches that extend the LDA model into the conversation, and to document our exploratory movements at MITH.

Documenting the Now is aimed at accomplishing two different, but deeply interrelated goals. The first is to develop an open source Web application called DocNow that will allow researchers and archivists to easily collect, analyze and preserve Twitter messages and the Web resources they reference. The second is to cultivate a much needed conversation between scholars, archivists, journalists and human rights activists around the effective and ethical use of social media content. We are very grateful to the Andrew Mellon Foundation for its generous support that will allow us to pursue these goals over the next two years.\n\n\n\nAs you can imagine, realizing the second goal is really a prerequisite for achieving the first. We want the DocNow application to reflect the use cases and requirements that emerge from the conversation. But at the same time, in order to have a meaningful conversation we need to know what is possible when it comes to collecting, analyzing and preserving social media content. That’s why we will be doing both concurrently, starting with our hand picked board of advisors, and software development team ... and you, if you are interested. We will use early prototyping on the DocNow application to drive the conversation, and inform its continued development. We’re just getting started but this blog post provides a brief look at how the project came to be, some initial ideas we have for directions to head in, and how you can get involved if you are interested.[/fusion_text][fusion_text]\n\n<h2>Background</h2>\n\n[/fusion_text][fusion_text]\n\nI say we are just getting started, but the seeds for Documenting the Now can be found back in 2014 at a meeting of the Society of American Archivists in Washington DC. Although separated in space, many of the conversations at the conference in DC centered on the ongoing protests over the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Michael_Brown\">killing of Michael Brown</a>, an unarmed African American teenager, by white police officer Darren Wilson. News of the killing and ongoing protests spread initially in social media.. Even as traditional media began reporting on the story, their narrative was challenged, and reframed by the conversation in Twitter. While the democratizing role of social media is ideologically complex, Sarah Jackson and Brooke Foucault Welles have <a href=\"http://www.northeastern.edu/camd/commstudies/2016/01/15/guided-national-debate-ferguson/\">uncovered evidence</a> that in Ferguson, Twitter allowed individual initiators to raise awareness about the events in the initial hours following the death of Michael Brown:\n\n<blockquote>African-Americans, women, and young people, including several members of Michael Brown’s working-class, African-American community, were particularly influential and succeeded in defining the terms of debate despite their historical exclusion from the American public sphere. This highlights democratic potentials within the networked public sphere, particularly vis-à-vis the discursive labor of members of American counter publics willing to contribute collective knowledge and critiques to the process of making sense of community crisis.\n\n<a href=\"#ref-jackson-welles-2015\">Jackson &amp; Welles, 2015, p. 412</a></blockquote>\n\nThe archivists in DC that week were particularly attuned to the importance of this documentation that was being unfurled into Twitter, and outwards onto the Web as photographs, video and audio—some of it being livestreamed to a global audience. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bergisjules\">Bergis Jules</a> and myself took part in that conversation at SAA, and resolved to do what we could to collect the Twitter conversation as best we could, for researchers now and in the future.\n\n\n\nOf course, just as the deaths of countless other people of color at the hands of police preceded Michael Brown they tragically continued over the next few months: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Tamir_Rice\">Tamir Rice</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Eric_Courtney_Harris\">Eric Harris</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Lamar_Scott\">Walter Scott</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Ferrell\">Jonathan Ferrell</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandra_Bland\">Sandra Bland</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_DuBose\">Samuel DuBose</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Gray\">Freddie Gray</a>. The only difference this time was that the traditional media outlets began to pay more attention, as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter\">Black Lives Matter</a> movement started by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alicia_Garza\">Alicia Garza</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrisse_Cullors\">Patrisse Cullors</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opal_Tometi\">Opal Tometi</a> in 2013, accelerated in towns and cities across the United States.\n\n\n\nBergis and I continued our data collection work over the past year. You can see a description of some of these datasets in this TimeMapper visualization. We also began to write about this process of data collection and analysis online at Medium in the <a href=\"https://medium.com/on-archivy\">On Archivy</a> column. We were pleased to receive useful feedback and additional contributions from the Web archiving community.\n\n\n\nOver this same period MITH participated in a series of <a href=\"http://blacklivesmatterumd.tumblr.com/\">BlackLivesMatter teach-ins at UMD</a>. These <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/researching-ferguson-update-previewing-miths-teach-ins-blacklivesmatter-umd/\">workshops</a> were aimed at helping students and faculty contextualize the events in Ferguson, and help make them it part of their study. As a result we began to get requests from researchers such as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ecalvo68\">Ernesto Calvo</a> in Political Science as well as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SociologistRay\">Rashawn Ray</a> and <a href=\"https://socy.umd.edu/gradprofile/Brown/Melissa\">Melissa Brown</a> in Sociology who wanted to use the data we had collected in their research. Bergis and I also began conversations with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mre1920\">Meredith Evans</a> at WUSTL to see if there was a way to collaborate with them on their Documenting Ferguson archive. We wanted to help WUSTL figure out how the pivotal material in social media could form part of their archive.\n\n\n\nIt was at this time that we realized the potential for the Documenting the Now project. While many tools existed for collecting Twitter data, none were particularly suited to the needs of archivists who need to not only collect, but also appraise the material referenced in this conversation: the text, images, audio and video that is out on the Web. We didn’t have an ethical framework for involving the content creators in this process. We needed meaningful and workable models that would allow archivists to engage with content creators, or the initiators that Jackson and Welles describe. How can we build collections that are useful for researchers studying events like those in Ferguson, while also respecting the rights of the content creators, and Twitter’s Terms of Service?[/fusion_text][fusion_text]\n\n<h3>Social Media Archiving</h3>\n\n[/fusion_text][fusion_text]Another important dimension to our work, is the relationship between the DocNow application we are building to other projects in the Web archiving space: specifically the <a href=\"http://sfm.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\">Social Feed Manager</a> from George Washington University and <a href=\"https://webrecorder.io/\">Rhizome’s WebRecorder</a> project.\n\n\n\nBergis was instrumental in helping start the SFM project at GWU, so we have a vested interest in using or at least interoperating with it. SFM’s scope is simultaneously a bit broader and a bit narrower than DocNow’s. SFM is best thought of as an extensible framework for collecting data from multiple social media sites including Flickr, Weibo as well as Twitter. DocNow on the other hand is narrowly focused on Twitter, at least to start with. The reason for this is that DocNow is going to be an environment for viewing, selecting and curating content from Twitter. SFM has explicitly kept access, discovery and analysis of content out of scope. We plan to work closely with the SFM team to make sure that DocNow will interoperate with SFM at the data layer. One specific use case we will be looking at is functionality that would allow data collected with SFM to be imported into DocNow for analysis and curation.\n\n\n\nAnother area in which SFM and DocNow differ is in their approach to archiving the Web. In DocNow we are explicitly interested in using the social media stream as a lens for finding and evaluating Web content. This idea is not unique to DocNow: it has been explored by the British Library in their <a href=\"http://www.netpreserve.org/projects/twittervane\">TwitterVane</a> experiment, and is currently being investigated by the NSF funded <a href=\"http://eventsarchive.org/\">EventsArchive</a> project at Virginia Tech, as well as the <a href=\"http://icrawl.l3s.uni-hannover.de/\">iCrawl project</a> at the L3S Research Center. While we certainly will be paying attention to these ongoing efforts we think our approach in DocNow is going to be substantially different because our primary use cases involve curation, and the appraisal of content, that directly considers the role of content creators.\n\n\n\nDocNow’s need for Web archiving functionality is why we are extremely interested in using Rhizome’s <a href=\"https://webrecorder.io/\">WebRecorder</a> project. WebRecorder provides an open source, curator oriented environment for collecting and archiving Web content. Unlike more traditional automated approaches to Web archiving it uses the attention of the curator to guide preservation, and the curator’s browser as an intrinsic part of the process. One specific way that we are hoping this collaboration will take shape is in the contextualization of Web content. As content is being collected from the Web can archivists and researchers apply notes about why the resource was collected, and potentially document interactions with the content’s creator? WebRecorder was funded by Mellon in the same cycle as Documenting the Now, so we have a very real incentive to align the two projects.\n\n\n\nOne final area of development for DocNow that hasn't been mentioned yet is our approach to visualization and analysis. In order to allow curators and archivists to build collections of social media and Web content we will necessarily need to build views into the collected data. We can anticipate a set of views, or a dashboard of sorts that provides insight into the conversation and the Web content, as well as functionality to collect and annotate it. But we also know that we will not be able to fully anticipate all the needs of all research questions.\n\n\n\nOf course this uncertainty is what makes research interesting: asking questions that have never been asked before. So we want to build DocNow so that it provides a workspace for more knowledgeable users to run their own analysis. We are particularly excited about the work coming out of the <a href=\"https://uwaterloo.ca/web-archive-group/\">Web Archives for Historical Research Group</a> at the University of Waterloo, who are using Jimmy Lin's <a href=\"https://github.com/lintool/warcbase\">WarcBase</a> and Apache Spark as a platform for analysis of Web archives. We are hoping that Web accessible workspaces like SparkNotebooks or <a href=\"http://jupyter.org/\">Jupyter</a> notebooks the are embedded in DocNow could provide a compelling environment for research use of the data collections. It is still early days, but if this seems like an interesting avenue to explore please <a>get in touch</a>. We are hiring part time developers and designers to help us out with the work.[/fusion_text][fusion_text]\n\n<h3>Silences in the Archive</h3>\n\n[/fusion_text][fusion_text]\n\nCentral to our work in Documenting the Now is the humanist’s awareness that what we know of history is deeply tied to the traces that are created and remain in our archives to be accessed and analyzed by researchers. How is our knowledge today shaped by the silences that our archives contain? Trouillot’s notion of historical production lays bare this process, in which archives form such a crucial element:\n\n<blockquote>Silences enter the process of historical production at four crucial moments: the moment of fact creation (the making of sources): the moment of fact assembly (the making of archives); the moment of fact retrieval (the making of narratives); and the moment of retrospective significance (the making of history in the final instance).\n\n\n\n(Trouillot, 1997, p. 26)</blockquote>\n\nWe want Documenting the Now (the conversation and the application) to embody this process, by allowing this new cultural and historical material to be archived, so that narratives and history can be made of them. This isn’t a process that a single institution or organization can do alone. It is a shared responsibility that spans disciplines, professions and technical frameworks.\n\n\n\nSo, this is the challenge that we’ve signed up for. We are extremely fortunate to be joined by a distinguished board of 18 advisors from the fields African American studies, communication, journalism, digital libraries as well as practicing archivists, journalists and technologists. You can see a list of them below. You can also expect to hear more about our work as it develops here on the MITH blog, on our (currently minimalist) project website where you can also sign up for an occasional newsletter. If you are really interested in participating we will let you know about our regular community calls, where we will discuss recent developments and use cases you might have.[/fusion_text][fusion_text]\n\n<h3>Our Advisory Board</h3>\n\n[/fusion_text][fusion_text]<em>In alphabetical

The cries of ‘how could this happen here?’ and ‘we had no idea!’ were discordant with the long history of sexual and racial violence at UVa.\n\n\n\nTogether with Professor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lisa_goff?lang=en\">Lisa Goff</a>, the <a href=\"http://scholarslab.org/\">Scholars’ Lab</a> team organized a digital archive to document this history at the university. <a href=\"http://scholarslab.org/people/jeremy-boggs/\">Jeremy Boggs</a> and I felt the archive must be feminist at the core, that feminist principles must be present at each stage-from collecting materials, to describing and organizing metadata, to the interface, to the ways in which the archive was shared. While we continued to work on <a href=\"http://takeback.scholarslab.org/\">Take Back the Archive</a>, we felt this feminist mode of working could be extend to other projects.\n\n\n\nAdvocacy by Design articulates a shared understanding and practice that fronts questions of how people are represented in, or are subjects of, academic work; questions of who reads and uses our work as well as those who collaborate and contribute to our work. We articulate this advocacy through particular stances on a number of interrelated concepts, we call principles. Some principles are borrowed from Shaowen Bardzell’s <a href=\"http://wtf.tw/ref/bardzell.pdf\">Feminist HCI: Taking Stock and Outlining an Agenda for Design</a>, while others grew out of our experiences with Take Back the Archive.\n\n\n\nThese principles include within them components and elements, such metadata, project management, and licenses, to better apply principles throughout a research inquiry. Advocacy is active--an attention-based practice of asking what are we doing to foster diverse voices? What do these practices look like face-to-face? What do they look like in the things we design, build, share?\n\n\n\nAdvocacy by Design begins with defining, seeking ‘the why’ and using that why as a guide through the research area. Defining the why enables us to identify which hows are critical. In the beginning stages of a research project or formation of a library committee, task force, or service, the hows should be platform agnostic. For example, centering the why opens up not just what the goals of a particular service or committee will be, but why those goals are important? In turn, the why drives ‘how’ that service or committee will work, how it will be legible to patrons or library colleagues.[/fusion_text][fusion_imageframe image_id=\"18923\" style_type=\"none\" stylecolor=\"\" hover_type=\"none\" bordersize=\"\" bordercolor=\"\" borderradius=\"\" align=\"center\" lightbox=\"yes\" gallery_id=\"gallery\" lightbox_image=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/frank-chimero_why-and-how.png\" alt=\"Frank Chimero - Why and How\" link=\"\" linktarget=\"_self\" hide_on_mobile=\"small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_direction=\"left\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_offset=\"\"]http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/frank-chimero_why-and-how-980x607.png[/fusion_imageframe][fusion_text]As <a href=\"https://shapeofdesignbook.com/\">Frank Chimero</a> points out, it is easier to ask \"How do I paint this tree?\" (or in our case \"how do we organize a new committee?\") than to articulate why this tree or committee needs to be.  Defining the why clarifies the objectives of our work, something we can return to when the tasks pile up. For Advocacy by Design, the ‘why’ frames which principles should be fronted and how those principles can be enacted.\n\n\n\nI lean on Bess Sadler and Chris Bourg’s <a href=\"http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/10425\">Feminism and the Future of Library Discovery</a>:\n\n\n\n“Research libraries in particular have always reflected the inequalities, biases, ethnocentrism, and power imbalances that exist throughout the academic enterprise through collection policies and hiring practices that reflect the biases of those in power at a given institution.”\n\n\n\nMy ‘why’ is grounded in identifying and revealing practices that reinforce patterns of exclusion and inequality, the “how” flows from this beginning.\n\n\n\nAdvocacy by Design is not proscriptive, not a checklist, rather a way of practicing that invites return and reflection upon the why and how along with attention to the questions of <i>who is represented in-and are subjects of-archives and academic work</i>; questions of who reads and uses our work as well as those who collaborate and contribute to our work.\n\n\n\nPrinciples for Advocacy by Design include transparency, openness, stewardship, temporality, an ethic of care, accessibility and usability, poly-vocalism, sustainability, interoperability, and collaboration. Today I would like to focus on Transparency, Poly-vocalism, and Collaboration ending with some reflection on the Ethic of Care. As you will see, the principles are interconnected and elements move across them. It is not meant to draw strict boundaries, rather to develop a vocabulary to frame our discussion. Elements are ways to make visible the principles of Advocacy by Design within our workflows, interactions, and research products. What follows in future posts are example projects to tease out how different elements could work to enact specific principles.[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]",

The research project that produced the Roadmap was led by Alison Langmead, with Project Managers Aisling Quigley (2016-17) and Chelsea Gunn (2017-18). The final goal of that project was to create a digital sustainability roadmap for developers and curators of digital projects to follow. The work was initially based on what the project team discovered during its NEH-funded project, “Sustaining MedArt.\" In this blog post, which is a late entry in MITH’s <a href=\"https://mith.umd.edu/tag/mith-digital-stewardship-series/\">Digital Stewardship Series</a> from 2016, I’m going to talk a bit about what I discovered during the process of using the roadmap for one of MITH’s projects, how I synthesized our discoveries in the form of a concrete tool for MITH to utilize the roadmap afterward, and how this has changed some of my conceptions about digital sustainability practices.\n\n\n\nThe process of walking a future digital project through the roadmap can be completed either in a full eight-hour day session, or two four-hour sessions. During  the process, you work through three sections, each with different modules pertaining to aspects of a project’s future sustainability prospects. We chose the latter, with each attending member focusing on a different MITH project they were developing or working on. I opted to use a project for which we were awaiting funding at the time, <a href=\"https://mith.umd.edu/research/unlocking-the-airwaves/\">Unlocking the Airwaves: Revitalizing an Early Public and Educational Radio Collection</a>. Although significant time and effort went into developing the grant proposal for Airwaves, which included a section on sustainability, the Roadmap process cemented how much more concretely we could have been thinking through these issues, and how better planning for those components from the start would lead to better management of the project. In fact, one finding that Langmead and her team had discovered as they developed and tested the roadmap, is that thinking through the project management aspects of a digital project was a necessary first component to even being able to effectively get through the remaining sections of roadmap exercises. So as they went along, they added several elements and exercises to Sections A and B which force users to pinpoint the structural elements of their project. These include elements such as access points, deliverables, workflows, intellectual goals, data flow, and anticipated digital lifespan. This kind of work is essentially an extension of a project charter, which often includes a lot of these same basic concepts. In fact, Module B1 of the roadmap encourages users to create or reference existing charters, and stresses that using the roadmap in conjunction with a charter enhances the usefulness of both tools.\n\n\n\nThe lifespan questions in Section A were eye-opening, because although the need to ask them seems obvious - How long do you want your project to last? Why have you chosen this lifespan? - I think we as stewards of digital information feel compelled to predict unrealistically long lifespans, which Langmead and her collaborators define as “BookTime:”\n\n\n\n“BookTime” is a term we have coined to denote a project lifespan equivalent to, “As long as a paper-based codex would last in the controlled, professional conditions of a library.” It may often be assumed that this is coterminous with “Forever,” but that belief relies heavily on a number of latent expectations about the nature of libraries, the inherent affordances of paper and glue, and other infrastructural dependencies.\n\n\n\nThe module asks us to acknowledge that not every digital project can realistically span decades into the future, and that sometimes this honesty is better for both the project and your team. The module also leverages concepts such as ‘graceful degradation,’ and ‘Bloom-and-Fade,’ both of which, in moments of dark humor, felt similar to planning for a project’s  hospice care or estate. “It’s okay, everything dies, let’s just be open in talking about it and how we’ll get through it together.” Humor aside, it was a useful exercise for me to acknowledge that time, change, and entropy will stand in the way of a project achieving BookTime, and that that IS, in fact, okay.\n\n\n\n<img class=\"wp-image-20168 alignright\" src=\"https://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Roadmap-B2-Tech.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"270\" height=\"277\" />\n\n\n\nThe other two sections and exercises that I felt were the most useful and that provided the core, structural materials on which to base a sustainability plan were Sustainability Priorities (Section A4) and Technological Infrastructure (Sections B2 and B3). In the former, we were asked to list out the core structural components of a project “without which your project simply would not be <i>your</i> project,” and to list them in order of priority. This could include things such as, but not limited to, authority records, curated access points, facets, geo-spatial data, or digitized materials. We were also asked to define the communities that each property served. In the latter, we were asked to list out every single technological component of the project, from Google Drive, to Trello, to IIIF servers, to the university’s digital repository, define the function(s) of each, and assign project team members that are responsible for each. Then we were asked to realistically assess how long each technology was guaranteed to be funded, as well as “how the duration of the funding for members of your project team compares with the duration of the funding for technologies they maintain, keeping in mind that funding discrepancies may require special considerations and/or contingency plans to ensure uninterrupted attention.” Again, at first glance, much of this may seem very logical and obvious, but actually <i>doing</i> these exercises is illuminating (and sometimes sobering).\n\n\n\n<img class=\" wp-image-20167 alignleft\" src=\"https://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Roadmap-C1-NDSA.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"376\" height=\"290\" />After Sections A and B force you to have a reckoning with the deep dark potential (good and bad) of your project, Section C focuses on applying the the National Digital Stewardship Alliance (NDSA)’s Levels of Preservation to your identified structural components. The Levels of Preservation are a set of recommendations that align the entire the digital preservation spectrum in six core areas: Access, Backing up Work, Permissions, Metadata, File Formats, and Data Integrity. For each of these areas, the roadmap defines four ‘levels’ of commitment to each of these areas, and what each of those levels really mean. For example, Level 1 for Data Integrity involves designating which project members have credentials for certain accounts and services, and who has read/write/move/delete authorization. Levels 2-3 requires the ability to repair data and create fixity information for stable files, and Level 4 specifies the checking of that fixity data specifically in response to specific events or activities. After defining your current and anticipated levels in each area, you’re asked to define concrete actions your team would need to undertake in order to achieve your desired level. Once again, these exercises encourage expectation management, with comments like “Please note! Reaching Level 4 sustainability practices is not the goal. Your work here is to balance what your project needs with the resources (both in terms of technology and staff) that you have.” It also notes that it is “absolutely okay” to decide that your project will choose Level 0 for any one of these areas, choosing consciously not to engage with that area, using the resources you have to focus on what your team wants to prioritize.\n\n\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_20169\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"210\"]<img class=\" wp-image-20169\" src=\"https://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/IMG_1785-e1538682046509.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"210\" height=\"280\" /> Module A3 in written form[/caption]\n\n\n\nAfter the two four-hour meetings, my brain was full and I was full of new ideas about my project that probably should have already occurred to me, but that only coalesced in any meaningful way by walking through the roadmap process. I’ve also been around long enough to know that the giddy enthusiasm that comes after a meeting like this can die on the vine if those ideas aren’t transformed into actionable items and documented somewhere. I did have the printed roadmap modules and exercises with my written answers on them, and Langmead and her team were clear that if we wanted to merely file (or scan) those written documents and stop there, that was fine. But written in the final module of the roadmap is the recommendation that after its completion, \"make sure that you store the documentation for this, and all other, STSR modules in one of your reliable sites of project documentation.\" So after several months of contemplation, I finally determined that MITH’s most reliable current site of project documentation is Airtable, which we’ve been using more and more to track aspects of different projects.\n\n\n\nAirtable is an online relational database application that looks and functions like a spreadsheet in its default ‘Grid’ UI, but which also has more robust relational functions allowing you to meaningfully connect data between different tables/worksheets. As opposed to merely entering my answers to each module/exercise, I opted to begin by actually moving references and links to all the roadmap’s sections and modules into two tables in Airtable, so that the full text of each module was easily at hand for reference. I also included base, table, and\n\n\n\ncolumn descriptions at all levels (this would be the rough equivalent of Excel comments), which explain how information should be entered or that gave sample entries. The base description also provides an overview to this whole exercise, and gives attribution to the project in the format requested by Langmead and her team.\n\n\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_20166\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"571\"]<img class=\"wp-image-20166\" src=\"https://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Airtable-Roadmap-Descriptions.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"571\" height=\"244\" /> There are descriptions throughout with details on how to utilize each table or field. Click on the 'i' Info button to display them.[/caption]\n\n\n\nThere were actual spreadsheets provided by the Roadmap’s project team for certain exercises, and I uploaded those as new tables in Airtable, and modified them as needed to connect/link with other tables. For example, the Technological Infrastructure table (which includes all the various technologies used by your project), the ‘Project Member Responsible’ column is linked to the Project Team table. So after you’ve entered the data for each, you can go back to the Project Team table and see all the tech components each member is responsible for, rolled up in a <a href=\"https://guide.airtable.com/linking-tables/\">linked record field</a>. There’s also a reference table listing out the definitions of Levels 1-4 for each of the six NDSA areas, so when you’re deciding what to enter in the Sustainability Levels table, you can instantly reference that table and choose an appropriate level for each area. After crafting the ‘template,’ I tested its usability by entering all the data from Unlocking the Airwaves that I’d written down. By doing that I realized where there were a few tweaks and bottlenecks that needed ironing out, and went back and modified the template. See below for a few more screenshots of the completed template.[/fusion_text][fusion_slider hover_type=\"none\" width=\"\" height=\"\" hide_on_mobile=\"small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility\" class=\"\" id=\"\"]\n\n[fusion_slide type=\"image\" link=\"https://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/1-Airtable-Roadmap-UtA-Screenshots-Sections-Reference.jpg\" lightbox=\"yes\" linktarget=\"_self\"]https://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/1-Airtable-Roadmap-UtA-Screenshots-Sections-Reference-980x362.jpg[/fusion_slide]\n\n[fusion_slide type=\"image\" link=\"https://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2-Airtable-Roadmap-UtA-Screenshots-Modules-Reference.jpg\" lightbox=\"yes\" linktarget=\"_self\"]https://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2-Airtable-Roadmap-UtA-Screenshots-Modules-Reference-980x552.jpg[/fusion_slide]\n\n[fusion_slide type=\"image\" link=\"https://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/3-Airtable-Roadmap-UtA-Screenshots-QA.jpg\" lightbox=\"yes\" linktarget=\"_self\"]https://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/3-Airtable-Roadmap-UtA-Screenshots-QA-980x501.jpg[/fusion_slide]\n\n[fusion_slide type=\"image\" link=\"https://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/4-Airtable-Roadmap-UtA-Screenshots-Properties.jpg\" lightbox=\"yes\" linktarget=\"_self\"]https://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/4-Airtable-Roadmap-UtA-Screenshots-Properties-980x812.jpg[/fusion_slide]\n\n[fusion_slide type=\"image\" link=\"https://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/5-Airtable-Roadmap-UtA-Screenshots-Proj-Documentation.jpg\" lightbox=\"yes\" linktarget=\"_self\"]https://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/5-Airtable-Roadmap-UtA-Screenshots-Proj-Documentation-980x589.jpg[/fusion_slide]\n\n[fusion_slide type=\"image\" link=\"https://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/6-Airtable-Roadmap-UtA-Screenshots-Proj-Team.jpg\" lightbox=\"yes\" linktarget=\"_self\"]https://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/6-Airtable-Roadmap-UtA-Screenshots-Proj-Team-980x631.jpg[/fusion_slide]\n\n[fusion_slide type=\"image\" link=\"https://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/7-Airtable-Roadmap-UtA-Screenshots-Technologies.jpg\" lightbox=\"yes\" linktarget=\"_self\"]https://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/7-Airtable-Roadmap-UtA-Screenshots-Technologies-980x651.jpg[/fusion_slide]\n\n[fusion_slide type=\"image\" link=\"]https://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/8-Airtable-Roadmap-UtA-Screenshots-Sustainability-Levels.jpg\" lightbox=\"yes\" linktarget=\"_self\"]https://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/8-Airtable-Roadmap-UtA-Screenshots-Sustainability-Levels-980x357.jpg[/fusion_slide]\n\n[fusion_slide type=\"image\" link=\"https://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/9-Airtable-Roadmap-UtA-Screenshots-Sustainability-Checklist.jpg\" lightbox=\"yes\" linktarget=\"_self\"]https://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/9-Airtable-Roadmap-UtA-Screenshots-Sustainability-Checklist-980x707.jpg[/fusion_slide]\n\n[fusion_slide type=\"image\" link=\"https://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/10-Airtable-Roadmap-UtA-Screenshots-Sustainability-Levels-Reference.jpg\" lightbox=\"yes\" linktarget=\"_self\"]https://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/10-Airtable-Roadmap-UtA-Screenshots-Sustainability-Levels-Reference-980x343.jpg[/fusion_slide]\n\n[fusion_slide type=\"image\" link=\"https://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/11-Airtable-Roadmap-UtA-Screenshots-Resources.jpg\" lightbox=\"yes\" linktarget=\"_self\"]https://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/11-Airtable-Roadmap-UtA-Screenshots-Resources-980x553.jpg[/fusion_slide][/fusion_slider][fusion_text]\n\nSo now we’ve got the roadmap data for Unlocking the Airwaves saved in a reliable site of project documentation. MITH team members are now encouraged (but not required) to use the template as we develop new projects, and it’s available to anyone else who’d like to request a blank duplicated copy. Dr. Langmead also provided a gentle but useful reminder that there is inherent risk in picking and using any such technology for this purpose, since platforms like Airtable may not always remain available. She suggested that we include a mention along the lines of “The inclusion of Airtable in your project’s suite of technologies should be considered carefully (in line with the work done in Modules A5 and B2)” in the intro description text for the base, which we did.\n\n\n\nIn a way this was also a sense-making exercise wherein, by taking all the roadmap data and turning it into structured data, I'd not only be able to sync up all these components in my head and turn them into actionable tasks, I’d also better retain the information. Anyone who has transformed, mapped, or structured previously unstructured data knows that by doing these tasks, you become much more intimately connected to your data. But what I think really appeals to me about the roadmap process is the mindfulness aspect. It encourages participants to think beyond the theoretical concepts of sustainability and actually apply them, write them down, look at them, consider their implications, and be honest about project expectations as aligned with available resources. In a world of overtapped resources and academic and bureaucratic hurdles, that’s an incredibly valuable skill to have.[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container][fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=\"no\" equal_height_columns=\"no\" menu_anchor=\"\" hide_on_mobile=\"small-visibility,medium-visibility,large-visibility\" class=\"\" id=\"\" background_color=\"\" background_image=\"\" background_position=\"center center\" background_repeat=\"no-repeat\" fade=\"no\" background_parallax=\"none\" parallax_speed=\"0.3\" video_mp4=\"\" video_webm=\"\" video_ogv=\"\" video_url=\"\" video_aspect_ratio=\"16:9\" video_loop=\"yes\" video_mute=\"yes\" overlay_color=\"\" video_preview_image=\"\" border_size=\"\" border_color=\"\" border_style=\"solid\" padding_top=\"\" padding_bottom=\"\" padding_left=\"\" padding_right=\"\"][/fusion_builder_container]",

MMRPGs such as Second Life and World of Warcraft create complex social, narrative, and imaginative spaces that have been the subject of important recent books by Edward Castronova and Henry Jenkins, among others. Far from merely idle pastimes, these virtual worlds, or simulations, manifest increasingly vexed relations to our own daily realities. Castronova has calculated that one of the most popular and longest running games, EverQuest, has a real world economy whose GNP places it somewhere between that of Bulgaria and Russia; Reuters, meanwhile, has just opened a news bureau within Second Life, where it might be expected to cover events such as a Suzanne Vega concert that unfolded entirely within that world's virtual setting.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday we are interested in talking with persons/players active in one or more of these game worlds. We want *you* to come and educate *us* about your experiences, we want to get feedback on our current proposed work, and we want to discuss the possibility of creating an interest group for those interested in discussing MMRPGs at some kind of regular interval.\r\n\r\nNote: Jason Nelson's appearance, originally scheduled for 10/31, has been CANCELLED.\r\n\r\nComing up @MITH Nov. 7: VIKA ZAFRIN (Brown University), \"The Virtual Humanities Lab and the Evolution of Remote Collaboration.\" View the complete Fall 2006 schedule for Digital Dialogues here:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100608224354/http://www.mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_fall_2006.pdf\">http://www.mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_fall_2006.pdf</a>\r\n\r\nFree and open to the public.\r\n\r\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-5896).",

The participants, which include the Information Schools at Maryland, the University of Texas, and the University of Michigan, as well as Nebraska's Center for Digital Research in the Humanities and Michigan State's MATRIX, alongside of MITH, will also work to develop a collaborative research program that draws on complementary areas of expertise and interest in the digital humanities and information studies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKARI KRAUS, Assistant Professor in the iSchool at Maryland with a joint appointment in the Department of English, is the principal investigator for the three-year $590,000 award.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to Kraus, \"There is tremendous interest among our MLS students in the digital humanities, in part because so many of them have an arts and humanities background.  Digital humanities as a field provides a perfect bridge between their undergraduate and graduate degrees. Many of our students are eager to find work in digital libraries and the cultural heritage sector, and these internships will help prepare them to do that.\" NEIL FRAISTAT, MITH's Director and a local Co-PI on the grant, adds \"We at MITH are delighted to be participating in this important program, which reflects the close ties we have forged with our own superb iSchool at the University of Maryland, as well as relationships we would like to build with other iSchools around the country. Together, we are helping to train the next generation of digital humanists.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe funded planning stage for the project begins this fall, with the first of a total of eighteen internships available in summer 2009.

      "Deena Larsen Collection",
      "DLC"
    ],
    "wp post content": "My previous posts on <em>The Deena Larsen Collection</em> (<em>DLC</em>) focused on visiting the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) in person and interacting with the collection physically. While at MITH I read through early versions of the poems in <em>Marble Springs</em>, I loaded 20-year-old diskettes into a 20-year-old computer (and crossed my fingers), and looked through a box of newly-received-but-as-yet-uncataloged materials. As it is not always convenient to drive 700 miles to visit MITH (although I am planning another such trip as I write this), it would be nice to have access to the collection from a distance. My first interaction with the <em>DLC</em>, as it will likely be for most of you, was electronic, rather than physical, through <em>The Deena Larsen Collection </em><a title=\"Deena Larsen Collection\" href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/research/deena-larsen-collection/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>, designed by Amanda Visconti (whom I follow on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Literature_Geek\" target=\"_blank\">@literature_geek</a>).\n\n<a title=\"Deena Larsen Collection\" href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/research/deena-larsen-collection/\"><img title=\"DLC_web_homepage\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DLC_web-front.jpg\" width=\"410\" /></a>\n\nThe <em>DLC </em>site has more detail about how the collection came to MITH, and Larsen’s artist statement. Another page is devoted to Larsen’s important work <em>Marble Springs</em>. The page includes a video of <em>Marble Springs</em> running on modern computing equipment via an emulator program. The bulk of the site, though, is given over to a growing catalog of the collection. At this writing there are 114 photos of <em>DLC</em> contents, including the <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/larsen/items/show/41\" target=\"_blank\">Mac Classic II Cozy</a>, the previously mentioned <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/larsen/items/show/42\" target=\"_blank\">shower curtain</a> (below), and a cover shot of Brendon Towle’s paper \"<a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/larsen/items/show/153\" target=\"_blank\">Towards a Prescriptive Theory of Hypertext Fiction</a>\".\n\n<a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DLC_showercurtain.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone\" title=\"DLC_ShowerCurtain\" alt=\"Shower Curtain\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DLC_showercurtain.jpg\" width=\"410\" height=\"307\" /></a>\n\nThe on-line catalog is great, giving a sense of what the collection contains. However, I will admit to feeling teased by it, like a kid outside a candy shop with a closed sign hanging in the window.\n\nThe fact that the catalog represents a fairly small portion of collection has everything to do with resources. “We don’t have the institutional resources,” MITH Associate Director Matthew Kirschenbaum notes. At this point, Kirschenbaum is the only MITH staffer assigned to the <em>DLC</em>, and they are currently without an intern.\n\nFurther, Kirschenbaum, while he would like to begin digitizing items in the collection, pointed out some of challenges to fully digitizing the contents. In good archival practice, items need to have full metadata applied. Then, the collection is not limited to Larsen’s output, so there are concerns over intellectual property and copyrights. And while we can create digital representations of textual documents easily (given the time), the collections more interesting electronic literature pieces present complex problems. Should we try to emulate or migrate <em>Marble Springs</em> and other hypertexts (if we can get permission)?\n\nFinally, I asked Kirschenbaum about separating the intellectual content of the work from the physical artifact. “My own intellectual training,” he answered, “and my convictions are that the materiality of the artifact is essential to its identity, and one should not separate those things. I think Marble Springs is a particularly powerful example of that because Deena I think had very clearly a sense of the computer itself as part of the environment of the work.” Kirschenbaum went on to say that it still may be useful to try to migrate works like <em>Marble Springs</em>, into perhaps HTML, if we can maintain the primary functionality, but that would depend on audience need. “I don't think you can be a fundamentalist about those things,” he added.\n\nSo while there are significant difficulties to full digitization of <em>The Deena Larsen Collection</em>, there are a few steps that could be taken in the short term, to give distant researchers greater access. Papers, such as Larsen’s 1992 Thesis, <em>Hyperpoems and Hyperpossibilites </em>(below), could be scanned and made available to read on-line or via download. Currently, the catalog has a picture of the cover page, and a few interior pages. Making the thesis digital would give hypertext researchers an interesting pre-World Wide Web view.\n\n<a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DLC_HandH_cover.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright\" title=\"DLC_HandH_cover\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DLC_HandH_cover_sm.jpg\" width=\"225\" height=\"244\" /></a>\n\nAs the collection contains hundreds of articles about computers and the development of Web culture, a linked bibliography of Larsen’s clippings could be created. Such a bibliography could help to contextualize Larsen’s thoughts on, and practice in, hypertextual works with the wider computer culture. Further, it could be a useful tool for researchers.\n\nLarsen attended a number of conferences over the past two decades, collecting conference materials. Perhaps MITH could work out an arrangement to share links with the organizations that sponsored the conferences and the <em>DLC</em>, perhaps attracting more traffic and interest to the collection.\n\nThe <em>DLC </em>could also produce some original works based on items in the collection. Larsen met hundreds of people, and apparently was an avid business card swapper, as stacks and stacks of them are now in the collection. A visualization of e-literature, hypertextuality, and computer social networks based on these cards could be revealing…or just neat to look at.\n\nThere is a great potential for making certain aspects of <em>The Deena Larsen Collection</em> available electronically rather easily, given time and human resources (not a given). There are also sizable challenges to making the most interesting parts of the collection available via the web; some technological in nature, others legal. Since the <em>DLC</em> staff would like to make more materials available to researchers, hopefully resources can be found to do so. Hopefully too, as its curators see the DLC as a research test bed, the work of researchers utilizing the collection can address some of these challenges, and the output can be incorporated into <em>The Deena Larsen Collection</em>.\n\n<em>The Deena Larsen Collection </em>is nearly as much about the hypertext community of the late Twentieth Century as it is about the works of Deena Larsen herself. It will likely need to be a community effort to expand the reach of <em>The Deena Larsen Collection.</em>\n\n_______________________________________________\n\nI would like to thank Matthew Kirschenbaum and all the folks at MITH for the opportunity to post on a collection to which I feel such a deep connection.\n\nI would also like to thank Deena Larsen for her encouragement as I study her work.\n\n_______________________________________________\n\nWant to schedule a visit to the <em>DLC</em>?

    "wp post content": "WASHINGTON (March 27, 2007) The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) at the University of Maryland are pleased to announce a summit meeting to plan a national coalition of digital humanities centers.\r\n\r\nThe meeting will take place at NEH headquarters in Washington, D.C., on April 12-13, 2007. The meeting is part of NEH's Digital Humanities Initiative, which supports projects that use or study the impact of digital technology on the humanities. Digital technology offers humanists new ways to conduct research, conceptualize relationships, and present scholarship to a wider audience.\r\n\r\nAt digital humanities centers around the country, historians, archaeologists, and other humanities scholars have been working with computer scientists and engineers to develop innovative ways of applying emerging digital technologies to the humanities. These collaborations have created new methods of conducting research, interpreting archival data, and teaching the humanities.\r\n\r\nIn order to take the digital humanities, and humanities scholarship, to the next level, national collaboration needs to be encouraged between digital humanities centers and funding organizations.\r\n\r\n\"Digital humanities centers serve as the technological backbone for the future of humanities scholarship,\" said Dr. Bruce Cole, Chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities. \"Encouraging collaboration among the centers will serve to speed innovation and replicate success throughout the nation.\"\r\n\r\nCollaborative work done by the nation's network of science labs has produced major breakthroughs, such as the human genome project and the creation of the Internet. As with the science labs, this new network of digital humanities centers will promote the national exchange of ideas and research necessary to generate revolutionary innovations in the humanities.\r\n\r\nThe centerpiece of the conference is a day-long discussion of key issues involved in fostering collaboration, developing funding resources, and creating blueprints for future projects. The discussion will be chaired by Neil Fraistat, Director of the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities.\r\n\r\n\"We hope that by the end of the meeting, a framework will be in place for a national coalition of digital humanities centers that can start functioning immediately,\" says Fraistat.\r\n\r\nAlong with the directors of major digital humanities centers, representatives from government, industry, and the private sector will be in attendance, including those from the Mellon Foundation, Google, Institute of Museum and Library Services, National Science Foundation, American Council of Learned Societies, the J. Paul Getty Trust, John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, Henry Luce Foundation, Internet2, and Library of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe conference begins at 4:00 p.m. on April 12, with a welcome address by NEH Chairman Bruce Cole. John Unsworth will then deliver a plenary address on \"Digital Humanities Centers as Cyberinfrastructure.\" Unsworth is the director of the Graduate School of Library and Information Science at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. Vint Cerf, the Chief Internet Evangelist for Google, will also provide some remarks. A reception follows hosted by the University of Maryland's Dean of Arts and Humanities James Harris, and Dean of the Libraries Charles Lowry.\r\n\r\nOn April 13, the conference attendees will spend the day discussing how to create a framework for a permanent coalition of digital humanities centers.\r\n\r\nNEH media contact: Elissa Pruett at (202) 606-8446\r\n\r\nMITH media contact: Neil Fraistat at (301) 405-8596",

The goal is to develop improved software and user interfaces that empower diverse users in the sciences and arts to be more productive, and more innovative. Potential users include a combination of software and other engineers, diverse scientists, product and graphic designers, and architects, as well as writers, poets, musicians, new media artists, and many others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnhanced interfaces could enable more effective searching of intellectual resources, improved collaboration among teams, and more rapid discovery processes. These advanced interfaces should also provide potent support in goal setting, speedier exploration of alternatives, improved understanding through visualization, and better dissemination of results. For creative endeavors that require composition of novel artifacts (computer programs, engineering diagrams, symphonies, animations, artwork), enhanced interfaces could facilitate rapid exploration of alternatives, prevent unproductive choices, and enable easy backtracking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis NSF-sponsored workshop (June 2005, <a href=\"http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/CST/\">http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/CST/</a>) brought together 25 research leaders and graduate students to share experiences, identify opportunities, and formulate research challenges. Two key outcomes emerged:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1) Formulation of guidelines for design of creativity support tools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2) Novel research methods to assess creativity support tools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next step is planning for the June 2007 Conference on Creativity and Cognition in Washington, DC. The talk is also meant to invite participation in organizing this event.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEN SHNEIDERMAN (<a href=\"http://www.cs.umd.edu/~ben\">http://www.cs.umd.edu/~ben</a>) is a Professor in the Department of Computer Science Founding Director (1983-2000) of the Human-Computer Interaction Laboratory (<a href=\"http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/\">http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/</a>), and Member of the Institutes for Advanced Computer Studies &amp; for Systems Research, all at the University of Maryland at College Park. He was elected as a Fellow of the Association for Computing (ACM ) in 1997 and a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in 2001. He received the ACM SIGCHI Lifetime Achievement Award in 2001.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBen is the author of Software Psychology: Human Factors in Computer and Information Systems (1980) and Designing the User Interface: Strategies for Effective Human-Computer Interaction (4th ed. 2004) <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20030608130259/http://www.awl.com:80/DTUI/\">http://www.awl.com/DTUI/</a> . He pioneered the highlighted textual link in 1983, and it became part of Hyperties, a precursor to the web. His move into information visualization helped spawn the successful company Spotfire http://www.spotfire.com/ . He is a technical advisor for the HiveGroup and ILOG. With S Card and J. Mackinlay, he co-authored Readings in Information Visualization: Using Vision to Think (1999).

Professor Sample argues the ideal result is the open source professor, a teacher and scholar who applies the tenets of the open source software community to his or her own professional life. This means sharing, conversation, collaboration, and reflection at every step in the teaching and research process, not just with the final product. Technology plays a key role in making open source professing possible, and Professor Sample will discuss the philosophical and practical implications of such a transparent approach to pedagogy and scholarship, as well as possible pitfalls for untenured faculty.\n\nPROFESSOR MARK SAMPLE teaches and researches contemporary American literature and Digital Culture at George Mason University. His most recent publication, in Game Studies, explores the interplay between video games, the War on Terror, and the production of knowledge. Professor Sample can be found blogging at http://www.samplereality.com.\n\nComing up @ MITH 11/3: Ben Bederson, Nick Chen, &amp; Matt Kirschenbaum, &quot;The Great Ebook Throwdown&quot;\n\nView MITH&apos;s complete Digital Dialogues Schedule here:\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20100608230933/http://www.mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_fall_2009.pdf\n\nAll talks are free and open to the public!\n\nContact Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-8927)",

It also concerns the processes of inclusion and exclusion through which bodies of texts take shape in the form of editions, archives, collections, and exhibition building, as well as the ethical responsibilities faced by textual scholars, archivists, conservationists, media archaeologists, digital resource creators, and cultural heritage professionals engaging in these processes.</span>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/sts2017\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Click here to view the conference website</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, which now includes the program schedule and list of speakers (subject to change), a link to register, and information on hotel reservations and other logistics. </span><b>Please note that there are a limited number of rooms available at the discounted group conference rate at the College Park Marriott, and room reservations must be made before April 17, 2017. </b>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We are beyond excited to host this fantastic event, and hope to see many of your faces here in College Park in late May!!</span>",

The irony is that explicit training in the professional tools employed by professors, would actually make PhDs who end up off the tenure track, more widely employable. This presentation is intended to open up a discussion to identify professional tools that will make PhDs better professors, better alt-ac employees, and create better paths to non-academic careers. All we have to do is shake the fantasy that scholarship alone will save us, that everything practical can be absorbed through osmosis, that even admitting contingency is tantamount to failure. It's time to get real about who we are and what we do.\n\nTIM CARMODY has a PhD in Comparative Literature &amp; Literary Theory from the University of Pennsylvania (2009), where he also served as a postdoctoral fellow in 2009-2010. From 2007-2009, Tim was the graduate student representative on the MLA's Nominating Committee, and member and co-chair of the Committee on the Status of Graduate Students in the Profession. In 2010, he left the academy to become a full-time technology and culture journalist, joining Wired.com and writing for The Atlantic, MIT Technology Review, Kottke.org, Lifehacker, and HiLobrow. He also blogs about ideas &amp; journalism at Snarkmarket, pop culture at The Idler, and the history and future of reading at Bookfuturism.com. He specializes in crossover pieces --- writing about cell phones or video game consoles for liberal arts audiences, or the shift from parchment to paper for e-reader enthusiasts, or what William Carlos Williams's Paterson can teach us about cyborgs. Mostly, he likes to think really hard while talking as fast as he can.\n\nA continuously updated schedule of talks is also available on the <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/podcast/\">Digital Dialogues webpage</a>.\n\nUnable to attend the events in person? Archived podcasts can be found on the MITH website, and you can follow our Digital Dialogues Twitter account <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/digdialog\">@digdialog</a> as well as the Twitter hashtag #mithdd to keep up with live tweets from our sessions.\n\nAll talks free and open to the public!

    "wp post content": "Our most respected newspapers want their stories to be accurate because once the words are on paper, and the paper is in someone’s hands, there’s no changing them. The words are literally fixed in ink to the page, and mass produced into many copies that are pretty much impossible to recall. Reputations can rise and fall based on how well newspapers are able to report significant events. But of course physical paper isn’t the whole story anymore.\n\n\n\nNews on the web can be edited quickly as new facts arrive, and more is learned. Typos can be quickly corrected–but content can also be modified for a multitude of purposes. Often these changes instantly render the previous version invisible. Many newspapers use their website as a place for their first drafts, which allows them to craft a story in near real time, while being the first to publish breaking news.\n\n\n\nNews travels fast in social media as it is shared and reshared across all kinds of networks of relationships. What if that initial, perhaps flawed version goes viral, and it is the only version you ever read? It’s not necessarily fake news, because there’s no explicit intent to mislead or deceive, but it may not be the best, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2017/01/01/fake-news-and-how-the-washington-post-rewrote-its-story-on-russian-hacking-of-the-power-grid/#780dc24e291e\">most accurate </a>news either. Wouldn’t it be useful to be able to watch how news stories shift in time to better understand how the news is produced? Or as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jftitone\">Jeanine Finn</a> memorably put it: how do we understand the news <a href=\"https://jeaninefinn.me/2016/11/15/understanding-fake-news-in-2016-before-the-truth-gets-its-pants-on/\">before truth gets its pants on</a>?\n\n\n\nAs part of MITH’s participation in the <a href=\"https://www.docnow.io/\">Documenting the Now</a> project we’ve been working on an experimental utility called <a href=\"https://github.com/docnow/diffengine\">diffengine</a> to help track how news is changing. It relies on an old and quietly ubiquitous standard called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS\">RSS</a>. RSS is a data format for syndicating content on the Web. In other words it’s an automated way of sharing what’s changing on your website, and for following what changes on someone else’s. News organizations use it heavily. When you listen to a podcast you’re using RSS. If you have a blog or write on Medium an RSS feed is quietly being generated for you whenever you write a new post.\n\n\n\nSo what diffengine does is really quite simple. First it subscribes to one or more RSS feeds, for example the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/rss-feeds/2014/08/04/ab6f109a-1bf7-11e4-ae54-0cfe1f974f8a_story.html?utm_term=.650a7743f53f\">Washington Post</a>, and then it watches to see if any articles change their content over time. If a change is noticed a representation of the change, or a <a href=\"http://catb.org/jargon/html/D/diff.html\">diff</a>, is generated, the new version is archived at the <a href=\"https://archive.org/\">Internet Archive</a>, and the diff is (optionally) tweeted.\n\n\n\nWe’ve been experimenting with an initial version of diffengine by having it track the Washington Post, the Guardian and Breitbart News which you can see on the following Twitter accounts: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wapo_diff\">wapo_diff</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardian_diff\">guardian_diff</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/breitbart_diff\">breitbart_diff</a>. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ruebot\">Nick Ruest</a> at York University and Ryan Baumann at Duke University have been setting up their own instances of diffengine to track what is now 25 media outlets, which you can see in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryanfb/lists/diffengine/members\">this list</a>  that Ryan is maintaining.\n\n\n\nSo here’s an example of what a change looks like when it is tweeted:\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Deportation force is ‘not happening,’ Paul Ryan tells undocumented family - The Washi… <a href=\"https://t.co/OQEpG1Inj3\">https://t.co/OQEpG1Inj3</a> -&gt; <a href=\"https://t.co/NsDNI5Dflt\">https://t.co/NsDNI5Dflt</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/t0Q6iuG2qX\">pic.twitter.com/t0Q6iuG2qX</a></p>\n\n— Editing the Wapo (@wapo_diff) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wapo_diff/status/819885771469553664\">January 13, 2017</a></blockquote>\n\n<script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n\n\n\nThe text highlighted in red has been deleted and the text highlighted in green has been added. But you can’t necessarily take diffengine’s word for it right? Bots are <a href=\"http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/7090/5653\">sending</a> all kinds of fraudulent and intentionally misleading information out on the web — especially in social media. So when diffengine notices new or changed content it uses Internet Archive’s <a href=\"https://archive.org/about/faqs.php#1050\">save page now</a> functionality to take a snapshot of the page, which it then references in the tweet. So you can see the original and changed content in the <a href=\"https://archive.org/\">most trusted public repository</a> we have for archived web content. You can see the links to both the before and after versions in the tweet above.\n\n\n\ndiffengine draws heavily on the work and example of two similar projects: <a href=\"https://github.com/j-e-d/NYTdiff\">NYTDiff</a> and <a href=\"http://newsdiffs.org/\">NewsDiffs</a>. NYTdiff is able to create presentable diff images and tweet them for the New York Times. But it was designed to work specifically with the NYTimes API. diffengine borrows the use of phantomjs for creating tweetable images. NewsDiffs on the other hand provides a comprehensive framework for watching changes on multiple news sites (Washington Post, New York Times, CNN, BBC, etc). But you need to be a programmer to add a <a href=\"https://github.com/ecprice/newsdiffs/tree/master/parsers\">parser module</a> for a website that you want to monitor. It is also a fully functional web application which requires considerable commitment to setup and run.\n\n\n\nWith the help of <a href=\"https://pythonhosted.org/feedparser/\">feedparser</a> diffengine takes a different approach by working with any site that publishes an RSS feed of changes. This covers many news organizations, but also personal blogs and organizational websites that put out regular updates. And with the <a href=\"https://github.com/buriy/python-readability\">readability</a> module diffengine is able to automatically extract the primary content of pages, without requiring special parsing to remove boilerplate material on a site-by-site basis.\n\n\n\nTo do its work diffengine keeps a small database of feeds, feed entries and version histories that it uses to notice when content has changed. If you know your way around a <a href=\"https://sqlite.org/\">SQLite</a> database you can query it to see how content has changed over time. This database could be a valuable source of research data, or <a href=\"https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/handle/2142/39750\">small data</a>, for the study of media production, or the way organizations or people communicate online. One possible direction we are considering is creating a simple web frontend for this database that allows you to navigate the changed content without requiring SQL chops.\n\n\n\nPerhaps diffengine could also create its own private archive of the web content, rather than relying on a public snapshot at the Internet Archive. Keeping the archive private could help address ethical concerns around documenting particular individuals or communities when conducting research. If this sounds useful or interesting please get in touch with the <a href=\"https://www.docnow.io/\">Documenting the Now</a> project, by joining our <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf3E7PAXPoT-XoedpEy9UCTpDPS8kPj5JkMwpaWbuqVP0bTrQ/viewform\">Slack channel</a> or emailing us at <a href=\"mailto:info@docnow.io.\">info@docnow.io</a>.\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/docnow/diffengine/#Install\">Installation</a> of diffengine is currently a bit challenging if you aren’t already familiar with installing Python packages from the command line. If you are willing to give it a try let us know how it goes over on <a href=\"https://github.com/docnow/diffengine\">GitHub</a>. Ideas for sites for us to monitor as we develop diffengine are also welcome!\n\n\n\n<em>Special thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mkirschenbaum\">Matthew Kirschenbaum</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gregj\">Gregory Jansen</a> at the University of Maryland for the initial inspiration behind this idea of showing rather than telling what news is. <a href=\"http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/\">The Human-Computer Interaction Lab</a> at UMD hosted an informal workshop after the recent election to see what possible responses could be, and diffengine is one outcome from that brainstorming.</em>\n\n\n\n<em>This page was <a href=\"https://news.docnow.io/tracking-changes-with-diffengine-60bbbff81d7d\">originally published</a> on the Documenting the Now blog</em>",

Shelley e.1, e.2, and e.3. Beyond the fair copy of what is arguably Shelley’s greatest poem, these notebooks contain fair copies of his lyric poems “</span><a href=\"http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/contents/ode_to_heaven\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ode to Heaven</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">” and “</span><a href=\"http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/contents/misery/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Misery.—A Fragment</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">,” as well as his</span><a href=\"http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/contents/ion\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">draft translation of Plato’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ion</span></i></a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span></i>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As with our earlier release of the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Frankenstein </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">manuscripts, these manuscripts all appear as high quality page images accompanied by full transcriptions, and they are encoded in a </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">schema based upon the Text Encoding Initiative’s guidelines for “Representation of Primary Resources,” enabling researchers, editors, and students to pursue a variety of scholarly investigations. Our encoding captures important aspects of the composition process, tracing the revisionary evolution of primary manuscripts and enabling users to see and search for additions, deletions, substitutions, retracings, insertions, transpositions, shifts in hand, displacements, paratextual notes, and other variables related to the composition process.</span>\n\n\n\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Prometheus Unbound</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, itself, was first published in 1820 in a volume entitled </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Prometheus Unbound: A Lyrical Drama in Four Acts, With Other Poems </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">(hereafter </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">1820</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">). No poem caused Shelley (PBS) more pains to compose or occupied him for so long. It took him almost a year and a half to write the principal parts of the poem, beginning in late August or early September 1818 and ending in December 1819. But he appears to have been planning the poem as early as March 1818, and to be revising it as late as May 1820.</span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The</span><a href=\"http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/contents/prometheus_unbound/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">intermediate fair copy of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Prometheus Unbound</span></i></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> located in e.1-e.3 served as PBS's safekeeping copy; and he recorded in it revisions made to the poem after the press transcript had already been sent to England from Italy. Mary W. Shelley transcribed for the press most or all of Acts 1-3 between 5 and 12 September 1819, and all of Act 4 in mid-December 1819. As was his usual practice, PBS appears to have corrected the press transcripts, making a series of small final revisions to prepare the poem for the press. It is by now a commonplace that he was extremely dissatisfied with the published text of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">1820</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, the only edition of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Prometheus Unbound</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> to appear during his lifetime, for which he was not allowed to read proof. But the \"formidable list\" of errata he prepared for that text has been lost or destroyed—as has been the press transcript itself, which best would have reflected his intentions for the printed text. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The last surviving manuscript of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Prometheus Unbound</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> in PBS's hand, these notebooks are the necessary starting point for all those who desire to better their understanding of Shelley's greatest poetic achievement. </span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For this release, the S-GA team invested in refining the design of the site to improve users’ experience of navigating the rich contents of the Archive. Most notably, the contents of S-GA can all be accessed by Manuscript (with page images ordered by their sequence in the manuscript), or by Work (with page images ordered by their linear sequence in the work, e.g., Acts and scenes). The </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Frankenstein </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">manuscript page images have been refactored so that they can be accessed in all of the</span><a href=\"http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/contents/frankenstein_chapters\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">complicated arrangements and rearrangements</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> through which they have descended to us over time</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Our next planned release for S-GA in late Spring 2016 will increase its contents by an order of magnitude, with several thousand as yet untranscribed page images. We continue to work behind the scenes on opening the Archive to participatory curation.</span>",

Throughout the course of the year, Dr. Peterson is giving book talks across the country. A complete calendar of her events is listed on the <a href=\"http://www.blackgothamarchive.org/\">Archive</a>.\n\n\n\nThe <em>Speaking of Books... Conversations with Campus Authors</em> series of author talks and signings was begun in 2005 by the University of Maryland Libraries' Humanities Librarians to highlight new and interesting research by faculty members from all schools and colleges at the University of Maryland. These free events are open to all members of the campus community and the general public. Each author will answer questions following his or her talk and sign books, which will be available for purchase. Refreshments will be served.",

This meeting is free, but registration is required due to space limitations. Lunch will be provided. Visit <a href=\"http://www.openannotation.org/RolloutInfo.html\">the rollout page</a> for more information, including <a href=\"http://www.openannotation.org/MITH_Agenda.html\">an agenda</a> and <a href=\"https://www.eventville.com/Catalog/EventRegistration1.asp?Eventid=1010271\">registration</a>. Please register by April 19th.\n\nThe Open Annotation Data Model Rollouts are a series of three meetings organized by the members of the Open Annotation Consortium and Annotation Ontology to introduce the Open Annotation Data Model Community Specification developed through their collaboration as the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/community/openannotation/\">W3C Open Annotation Community Group</a>. This series of meetings is made possible by generous funding from the <a href=\"http://www.mellon.org/\">Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</a>.\n\nThese day-long public rollouts will inform digital humanities and sciences computing developers, curators of digital collections, and scholars using digital content about the W3C Open Annotation Community Group’s work. Topics will include the Open Annotation Data Model, the W3C Open Annotation Community Group, existing implementations of Open Annotation producers and consumers, and developer tools and resources.\n\nMITH will be presenting its <a href=\"http://umd-mith.github.com/OACVideoAnnotator/\">video annotation developer toolkit</a> developed in conjunction with <a href=\"http://alexanderstreet.com/\">Alexander Street Press</a>. The toolkit provides a JavaScript framework for creating and viewing annotations of video embedded in a web page without having access to the video stream, enabling annotation of proprietary video. MITH will also outline its ongoing work developing a Drupal module that will use this toolkit to enable annotation of video embedded in a website.\n\nThe May event is the second in the series. Other rollouts are being held at Stanford University in April and at the University of Manchester in June.",

    "wp post content": "A digital humanities center is nothing if not a site of constant motion: staff, directors, fellows, projects, partners, tools, technologies, resources, and (innumerable) best practices all change over time, sometimes in quite unpredictable ways. As small, partly or wholly soft-funded units whose missions involve research, or teaching, or anchoring a local interest community, digital humanities centers face fundamental challenges involving the long-term digital stewardship of the work they help to produce.\n\n\n\nThe importance of stewarding digital scholarship will only grow and the work will need to be shared by the entire digital humanities community. Founded sixteen years ago in 1999, MITH is proud of the way it has faced and continues to face these challenges. We would like to take this opportunity to document our practices in a series of blog posts, beginning with this one, in the hope of providing a clear and potentially useful record of our principles for digital stewardship, the issues we’ve faced, and our practices for dealing with them.\n\n\n\nIn this initial post, we’ll provide an overview of the actions MITH has taken to steward the variety of digital humanities work created here. In doing so, we’ll articulate the underlying principles that have guided our decisions and present some key lessons we’ve learned. Finally, we’ll point out some areas where further work is needed by stakeholders across the wider digital humanities community.\n\n<h3>What are we stewarding?</h3>\n\nTo document digital stewardship practices effectively, we need to be as clear as possible about what we are stewarding. In MITH’s case, we are concerned with actions taken to care for and manage over time the digital humanities work publicly shared by staff, students, faculty, librarians and others who have been affiliated with MITH. Given the era of MITH’s founding, the World Wide Web has been the chief means for making such work public. So as to have a compact way of referring to “digital humanities work made publicly available via the technologies of the web”, we will use the term “website” throughout this initial discussion of MITH’s stewardship activities. However, we purposefully understand the referents of “website” to encompass things ranging from collections of a few hyperlinked documents to complex applications and virtual worlds. In other contexts, these things might also be discussed as “databases”, “digital archives”, “tools”, or “projects”. (In other words, the use of the term “website” is a convenience based on the fact that most of the digital work we’re interested in was delivered using the web.) We acknowledge, furthermore, that the “websites” we are stewarding may represent or document the bulk of the intellectual, emotional, and technical labor of a person or a project, or they may represent very little of that labor—like the varying portions of icebergs buoyant enough to rise above the water line.\n\n\n\nAt one level, then, the digital humanities work we’re discussing comprises aggregations of computer files: documents and data in various formats, layers of interlocking software, and so on. At another level, this work comprises <a href=\"http://codespeak.scholarslab.org/\">tacit knowledge</a> of its creators—including knowledge located in the interrelationships between people. This work also comprises elements of how it has been received since it was made public—its position in networks of (hyper-) links and citations, for example. In discussing stewardship we mean the process of assessing, accounting for, and making decisions about how to represent all of these elements of the digital work people affiliated with MITH have created, within the constraints of available resources and from whatever situated vantage point each of us inevitably occupies.\n\n<h3>Principle: active records and archival records</h3>\n\nOne important principle for MITH’s stewardship activities is acknowledging that we manage digital materials of two different major types. To borrow from the parlance of <a href=\"http://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/r/record\">archives and records management</a>, we care for digital humanities websites as both “active records” and “archival records”. By active records, we mean websites that are still in regular use by creators or their successors to do digital humanities work. Such use could involve adding additional data, sharing with students in an ongoing course, or incorporating a site into a new project or publication. By archival records, we generally mean websites that are no longer the active project of the scholars who created them—for instance, if they are no longer being updated with new data—but which have ongoing value and interest from elements of the community beyond the original scholar or team. The actual age of a particular resource is not significant in this distinction: older work is not automatically “archival,” just as recent work can be active briefly and become “archival” in a short amount of time (work related to events like conferences is a good example).\n\n\n\nOne important implication that follows from our decision to think of MITH’s digital materials as records with active and archival modes is that this principle makes explicit the balance that a digital humanities center must strike. <a href=\"http://nowviskie.org/Graceful_Degradation.pdf\">Websites have a lifecycle</a>. Different choices and actions are appropriate at different stages of that lifecycle. On the one hand, for websites as active records, we want to maintain working systems in place to enable digital humanities work by specific members of our community with whom we have ongoing collaborative relationships. For websites as archival records, on the other hand, our aim may be less to manage active systems as it is to see that representations of earlier work are preserved in some form as evidence of people’s scholarship and of MITH’s own history.\n\n<h3>MITH’s stewardship in practice</h3>\n\nThe rubric of stewardship that MITH has outlined for itself encompasses both active management and digital preservation. The locus of this discussion of specific stewardship actions will be the MITH servers—as institutional spaces into which, over time, digital materials were transferred so as to be made public as part of digital humanities work.\n\n<h5>Systems Administration and \"Backups\"</h5>\n\nMITH has, for many years, as part of our active management, “backed up” the contents of our running server machines to guard against sudden data loss. At present, MITH pays for a service hosted by the University of Maryland Division of Information Technology for this purpose. These backups guard against data loss from a short-term failure of the servers—so that the latest copy of the full system can be restored to a recent running state. This backup service also ensures that copies of the data on MITH’s machines are duplicated at an additional location on the University of Maryland campus and to magnetic tape for storage at a geographically remote location from the campus (as current best practice suggests).\n\n\n\nActive management to support digital materials necessarily involves change—for one thing, physical machines wear out and become obsolete. The longer a website’s life, the more certain it is that those digital materials will need to be migrated from one system to another in response to the obsolescence of the underlying physical machines. Over its sixteen year history, MITH has used a succession of physical machines as servers. As machines approached their end of life, MITH would migrate the content of servers—the digital materials over which MITH exercised stewardship—to new hardware. As an example of this process and in the interest of precision, we’ll discuss actions undertaken on two generations of such systems: machines that hosted MITH’s projects from 2006 to 2009, and those that have hosted MITH’s projects since 2009. The two physical servers that hosted MITH projects from 2006 to 2009 also contain data representing an older generation of machines—copies of MITH’s digital work back to 2003. Given that the outgoing and the successor machines have run versions of the same operating system, migration refers to copying those parts of the system where users (rather than system utilities) have stored data. These include file directories associated with the accounts of people who were granted access to MITH machines, file directories utilized by the web server (containing the HTML and related documents and source code for various websites), as well as databases, and configuration files. The copying—migration—of these key files was part of the management of the MITH servers as active systems. The goal was to replicate functionality from one generation of physical hardware to the next. As part of server migrations, MITH also created disk images, that is complete copies, of the servers’ hard drives, and took other actions (about which we’ll say more below) to help ensure preservation of data.\n\n\n\nFor the majority of the digital work created at MITH, this represents the complete story. Basic active management has kept these websites, some quite old, online.\n\n<h5>Security</h5>\n\nThe life stories of digital materials can become more complex for a number of reasons. Security problems are one complication that face stewards of digital materials. In the case of digital humanities websites, the most common security problems involve SQL injection attacks in which interactive components of a site can be compromised to run malicious software code often for the purpose of sending spam messages or disrupting regular network traffic. MITH has direct experience with these challenges. At the request of the University of Maryland’s network administrators and with assistance from staff of the Division of Information Technology and paid external computer security consultants, MITH conducted a thorough review of all its projects in 2009 after several years of progressively increasing instability due to security problems. This review was conducted as part of migrating to new, clean systems and some sites were deemed too insecure to return to full, online availability. Compressed archives of projects, even those with security vulnerabilities, were copied to new machines and external storage media. No files were ever deleted but the process of responding to security concerns nonetheless created a category of projects that could not simply be reproduced online following the server migrations. These projects have needed to be managed in alternative ways. By evaluating some sites as archival records not solely as active projects, MITH staff decided to re-mount static resources—HTML pages, images, and so on—without the accompanying databases to lessen future security risk while preserving evidence of these projects. The 2008 Digital Diasporas Symposium is one example of this approach. A database had been part of the original site for the purpose of accepting registration information but no longer needed to be online after the end of the conference. In other cases, addressing security or other problems would require making choices or potentially altering features of sites. Where a site was no longer the active project of the scholar who created it (she/he has “completed” it and moved on), MITH has decided not to make substantial changes unilaterally.\n\n<h5>Migrations and Transfers</h5>\n\nDigital materials have also sometimes been migrated to other systems not managed by MITH, for example because a project director moved to another institution and wanted to transfer stewardship of the project. As a principle of stewardship, we believe that it is acceptable—even necessary—for the responsibility for digital work to change over time. This principle entails sharing copies of data with project creators and potentially others. At MITH, we consider sharing complete copies of digital materials (including the databases and all the other components) part of our stewardship in three specific ways: first, so that project creators have additional backup copies of their own, to manage as they see fit; second, so that those who request access can view materials from sites with security vulnerabilities offline; and third, so that stewardship of a site can be transferred to a new institution. MITH has made a practice of offering copies of digital material for personal backups when a funding period (for externally-supported projects), or a fellowship (for internally-funded projects), ends. Also, in 2007, those who had produced digital work at MITH up to that time were offered copies of their data to take for their own personal use. In these cases, project creators are provided with compressed archives of files copied from the MITH servers and MITH also retains copies. In the second case, of materials from sites that are offline due to security vulnerabilities, we have provided copies of files in response to specific requests on an ad hoc basis. When project directors or others choose to take over responsibility for a particular website, thereby ending MITH’s involvement in its active and ongoing management, MITH will link to or redirect traffic to the new versions of a digital project while also retaining copies of the earlier data created at MITH for preservation.\n\n<h5>Collaborative Work</h5>\n\nMITH’s experience with providing access copies of digital projects suggests issues that the community as a whole needs to grapple with further. As a principle, project creators should have access to their own work to use or build upon. Yet, almost all digital humanities projects are works of collaborative authorship and represent the efforts of not only project directors but staff members, graduate students, and others. Best practices for project charters probably need to indicate who can make decisions over the long-term. It is unwieldy to ask, long afterwards, all the graduate students who have worked on a project, for example, how to handle providing copies of materials but, at the same time, MITH takes seriously principles of respect for all contributors, as expressed in initiatives like the <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/offthetracks/recommendations/\">Collaborators’ Bill of Rights</a>. When third parties, not the original creators, want complete copies of a site the prospects become more complex yet. Solutions to many of these kind of conundrums involve using open licenses for content and source code. Other conundrums may be trickier—if materials are being transferred to someone other than the original creator should project files be reviewed, as is the process in many analog archives, so that personal information (if any) or database credentials could be removed or reset?\n\n<h5>Repositories and Archives</h5>\n\nIn addition to managing digital materials as part of active servers, MITH has taken steps to document projects created here as part of a broader stewardship strategy that also includes digital preservation activities. In 2012, MITH staff deposited a collection of materials with the institutional repository for the University of Maryland and we continue to make this a part of our project process. At around the same time, MITH moved its physical offices. In the course of the move, staff deposited boxes of physical materials documenting MITH’s activities with the University Archives. Also in 2012, MITH staff worked with the University of Maryland Libraries’ Special Collections and University Archives to ensure that internet addresses where most MITH projects are found would be regularly crawled by a web archiving tool (<a href=\"https://www.archive-it.org/\">Archive-It</a>) paid for through the Libraries’ collection budget. By adding an active partnership with the Libraries to MITH’s strategy we could be confident that our specific content would be collected and that collection would occur more regularly than could be expected from waiting for archiving software operated by the Internet Archive and other organizations to visit MITH sites.\n\n\n\nTo be sure, web archive versions of sites are not always identical to the original ones but we think they represent an important element of digital stewardship planning. Maintaining a live website, keeping it online and accessible at its original location with its complete original functionality, is not digital preservation but active management. A stewardship strategy predicated entirely on active management is unsustainable. For one, such a strategy is too expensive and labor-intensive given the limited resources of a digital humanities center such as MITH. Larger memory organizations such as libraries should aim to collect widely and reflect the diversity of practice of digital humanities work. The <a href=\"http://blog.dshr.org/2014/11/talk-costs-why-do-we-care.html\">economies of collecting and preserving such work at scale</a> also militate against stewardship strategies that depend on managing each digital humanities website (only) as an active system. Finally, active management of digital humanities websites, where they are embedded in a working web server, exposes them to ongoing risk of corruption and human error. We cannot ignore, for the convenience of present use, the aspect of preservation that involves removing materials from their original situation and relocating them where actions can be taken for their long term survival even if this entails changing the experience of using them. A serious discussion of digital stewardship must incorporate consideration of how best to sunset projects as active sites. For all these reasons, the role of web archives as they relate to the future use and preservation of digital humanities work is an area where there is much work still to do—and may be the subject of a future post.\n\n<h5>Additional Digital Preservation Strategies</h5>\n\nFinally, as we mentioned above, MITH has collaborated on a number of important digital preservation research projects that have affected how we preserve MITH’s own outputs. First, this research agenda has helped us recruit staff, students, and faculty interested in digital preservation challenges. MITH faculty and staff have authored <a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/mechanisms\">books</a>, <a href=\"http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/6/2/000129/000129.html\">articles</a>, <a href=\"http://dh2011abstracts.stanford.edu/xtf/view?docId=tei/ab-223.xml;query=;brand=default\">conference papers</a> and <a href=\"http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub149\">reports</a>, convened <a href=\"http://cirss.lis.illinois.edu/paloalto/\">summit meetings</a>, organized <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/pda2013/\">conferences</a>, led <a href=\"http://www.dhcuration.org/institute/\">training institutes</a>, built <a href=\"http://www.bitcurator.net/\">tools</a>, disseminated <a href=\"http://guide.dhcuration.org/\">resources</a>, and spoken widely on the importance of digital preservation and data curation. Second, by working on these digital preservation research projects, people at MITH have gained certain technical skills and conceptual approaches to problems. We’ll offer just one brief example of how this has played out. Though the physical machines that immediately preceded our current generation of servers were decommissioned about 6 years ago, MITH has retained this physical hardware, as well as various other internal and external hard drives of machines MITH staff and faculty have used. Credit this decision to the habits of thought and practice that MITH’s engagement with digital preservation has cultivated. Our work on digital preservation has caused us to consider the physical nature even of things like websites and to consider further how original hardware may represent a crucial element for preservation. A few months ago, MITH asked <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/people/person/porter-olsen/\">Porter Olsen</a>, former Community Lead of the <a href=\"http://www.bitcurator.net/\">BitCurator</a> project and a Graduate Assistant at MITH, to apply some of the skills he learned from his work here to help us evaluate whether new tools and capabilities could be applied to curating and preserving digital humanities materials from systems like MITH’s old web servers. We know from our research and our experience that no matter how thoughtfully we’ve crafted policies and procedures and no matter how carefully we’ve acted, digital stewardship is a complex and challenging endeavor that requires us to keep learning and trying to improve.\n\n\n\nIn the next post in the series, Porter will describe in more detail how he was able to use the BitCurator tools, which MITH helped develop, to collect and preserve additional information. In other future posts, Stephanie Sapienza, MITH’s Project Manager, will discuss work she’s been leading to revamp the section of our website where we document all of MITH’s work in order to make it easier to find information about previous projects. MITH’s Lead Developer Ed Summers will post some lessons learned about best practices for migrating complex and dynamic websites. And, since preserving computing hardware as well as software figures in the story of MITH’s digital stewardship practices thus far, we’ll also consider the preservation implications of the increasing move to “cloud” computing.\n\n<h3>(Provisional) conclusions</h3>\n\nThere are no ready-made solutions, no repositories ready to accept many of the kinds of complex objects digital humanists produce so every stewardship strategy falls somewhere along a spectrum of benefits and tradeoffs. Complex work carried out by multiple people over long spans of time during which our collective knowledge of best practices was itself evolving is difficult to judge according to a binary of success or failure, presence or erasure. Attempting to do so likely vitiates the value of the open and detailed discussion of this work for the community genuinely interested in preserving the fullest history of digital humanities work. It also runs counter to the conclusions generated by MITH’s own active research in digital preservation, and the theoretical and methodological writings of several of its staff and administration.\n\n\n\nWe would not claim that this process of caring for the range of MITH’s digital humanities websites has been flawlessly executed at every step. During server migrations, in particular, sites have sometimes gone offline due to a misconfiguration of one kind or another. When we discover these errors or when they have been pointed out to us, we’ve investigated and restored the online availability of materials where possible. Where this has not been possible because earlier work would need new investment to fix security vulnerabilities or make other substantial changes, we have documented projects and retained data—and even hardware. One thing the history of MITH’s digital work should suggest is that there are important distinctions between preserving data, maintaining or sustaining specific computing systems, and providing varying levels of access (online vs. offline, original vs. migrated).\n\n\n\nThe expectations of access for archival material differ from those for active material. Just as with analog collections, it may be necessary to find archival “websites” in different locations than their active counterparts; archival websites might take slightly different forms; additional requests or effort might be necessary to access these things. We at MITH recognize that it is a frustrating experience to find that digital work that was once available on the web is offline or that the experience of working with it has changed. As a community, our expectation of digital work has been that, in many cases, it’s present online or it’s gone. At MITH, where we have digital work that is preserved but not online this ingrained expectation is a challenge. For more and more digital work, we think that there must be a middle, archival way—how do we begin to incorporate this into our practices in satisfying ways? Most researchers have encountered analog collections that are unprocessed or materials that are out for repair and preservation. At the moment, this is perhaps the best comparison for the state of some few of MITH’s digital outputs, yet we are continuously working to develop and improve our own practices of curation and preservation.\n\n\n\nAt MITH, we have chosen a stewardship strategy that entails both actively managing systems that still run a variety of websites and also taking actions to preserve copies and alternate representations of these sites including through retention of compressed offline archives of project data, through web archiving, and through deposit of supplementary materials and documentation with both our (digital) institutional repository and our (analog) university archives.\n\n\n\nWe value the tradition of work that has been accomplished at MITH over the last 16 years. Digital humanities has a history and indeed multiple histories, not just in terms of the intellectual pedigree of the phrase or the concept, but in the legacy of material work that has been performed in its name. MITH’s research has addressed itself to issues of gender and diversity among other core humanist concerns. MITH has also attracted and recruited people interested in digital preservation, and has actively collaborated on a range of digital preservation projects and initiatives in its research. These intertwined aspects of our work have particular resonance now, given that digital humanities practitioners are placing increased emphasis on recovering narratives and origin stories for the field that are more diverse than some stakeholders seem interested in acknowledging. Stewarding the collective history of work at MITH thus helps make visible the diverse history of the digital humanities.\n\n\n\n<em><a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/tag/mith-digital-stewardship-series/\">Click here to access subsequent posts in our series on this topic</a>.</em>",

Reenactments were among the experiments in communication across knowledge worlds that began to take particular form in the nineties. Science-styled television documentary forms, internet repurposings, museum exhibitions, and academic historiographies worked hard to shape an array of cognitive sensations accessed, skilled and displayed by new technologies. These experiments became epistemological melodramas of identity, national interests, and global restructuring that tried to solve the tricky mapping problems of addressing many audiences simultaneously.\n\nKATIE KING is Associate Professor of Women's Studies at the University of Maryland, College Park, and a Fellow of the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH). She received her Ph.D. in the History of Consciousness at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Her interdisciplinary scholarship is located at the intersection of feminist technoscience studies, cyberculture and media studies, and LGBT Studies. Her first book was \"Theory in its Feminist Travels: conversations in U.S. women's movements.\" She has two others in progress now, \"Speaking with Things,\" an introduction to writing technologies, and the other, \"Networked Reenactments,\" flexible knowledges under globalization.\n\nView MITH's complete Digital Dialogues schedule here:\n\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20100615144914/http://www.mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_spring_2009.pdf\n\nAll talks free and open to the public!\n\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-8927).",

Ilya’s open-source <a href=\"http://github.com/ikreymer/pywb\">pywb</a> software allows for high-quality replay (browsing) of archived web data stored in standardized ARC and WARC file formats. It is similar in principle to the Internet Archive's <a href=\"http://archive.org/web/\">Wayback Machine</a>, but is distinguished by its ability to accurately replay complex dynamic sites, including video and audio content.\n\nIlya has worked recently with Harvard University to help integrate pywb into their <a href=\"http://perma.cc/\">perma.cc</a> service. perma.cc enables authors, and publishers to selectively archive Web content. He is currently working with <a href=\"http://rhizome.org/\">Rhizome</a>, a non-profit affiliated with the <a href=\"http://www.newmuseum.org/\">New Museum</a> in New York City, to help them archive highly dynamic digital art on the Web. You can read more about this work in a recent New York Times <a href=\"http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/10/19/a-new-tool-to-preserve-moments-on-the-internet/?_r=0\">article</a> about the project. Ilya has also worked to integrate pywb with <a href=\"http://github.com/lintool/warcbase\">WarcBase</a> which is a Hadoop based storage system for web archives created by UMD’s Jimmy Lin. Ilya previously worked as an engineer at the Internet Archive.\n\nWe expect this to be part demo, part technical discussion about pywb and web archiving in general. Please feel free to help us spread the word by disseminating this link to interested members of the community. Also, if you have a laptop bring it so you can try out some live web archiving.",

Whereas print editions of medieval literary texts typically treat the presence of competing textual versions, authors, and manuscript witnesses as a problem to resolve, either by recreating a hypothetical authorial text or choosing the best extant text to represent an entire textual or narrative tradition, digital manuscript archives are increasingly fostering a re-emergence of the simultaneous presence of competing voices and authorial roles. Digital media are thus allowing us an opportunity to \"get medieval\" in our representations of texts in a manner unprecedented in the age of print. Examples will be drawn from my work on three manuscript archives--the Roman de la Rose Digital Surrogates Project, the Piers Plowman Electronic Archive, and the Siege of Jerusalem Electronic Archive. No familiarity with medieval texts or textual traditions will be assumed or necessary to follow or participate in this discussion!\r\r\n\r\r\nTimothy Stinson earned his Ph.D. in English from the University of Virginia. His dissertation, entitled \"The Siege of Jerusalem: An Electronic Archive and Hypertext Edition,\" was an electronic archive of the nine surviving manuscripts witnesses of an anonymous fourteenth-century alliterative poem, and comprises editions of each of them linked to images of all extant manuscript leaves. He is currently a postdoctoral fellow at Johns Hopkins University, where he works on the Roman de la Rose Digital Surrogates Project.\r\r\n\r\r\nComing up @MITH Oct. 10: DANIEL PITTI (Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities, University of Virginia), \"Social Software: Why Would I Want to Consult an Encyclopedia that Would Have Me as a Contributor?\" View the complete Fall 2006 schedule for Digital Dialogues here: <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100608224354/http://www.mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_fall_2006.pdf\">http://www.mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_fall_2006.pdf</a>\r\r\n\r\r\nFree and open to the public.\r\r\n\r\r\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-5896).",

    "wp post content": "Later this week I will be attending the 2nd <a href=\"http://www.ai.soc.i.kyoto-u.ac.jp/culture2011/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">International Culture and Computing Conference</a> at the University of Kyoto and presenting the paper \"Diggable Data, Scalable Reading, and New Humanities Scholarship.\" Digital Humanities is rapidly gaining a foothold in Japanese academic scholarship, and this conference features a strand devoted to new methodologies, ideas and outcomes that arise from the application of digital methods.\n\nIn this paper, co-written with Neil Fraistat, we address two interrelated gains of the digital turn in humanities scholarship - one political and the other intellectual. First is the popularizing of humanities scholarship through the opening of opportunities for transmission of sources and outputs of digital scholarship. The paper then looks at some approaches to big data in the humanities, critiquing their value and pointing to some of the methodological questions they raise. It then goes on to argue for digital textual scholarship that can move from the massive to the particular, borrowing a phrase from Martin Mueller to argue for 'scalable reading', ultimately explaining how <a href=\"http://www.projectbamboo.org\" target=\"_blank\">Project Bamboo</a> will support the opening up of scholarship and scalable reading through digital means.\n\nIn a <a href=\"http://www.wallandbinkley.com/rcb/articles/newtools-output.html\" target=\"_blank\">1935 article in the Yale Review</a> the historian Robert C. Binkley wrote, \"Micro-copying is a technique that will... give the reader exactly what he wants, and bring it to him wherever he wants to use it.\" Binkley was an advocate of democratizing scholarship through the application of the new media technologies of the first half of the twentieth century. Similar arguments are often made today by advocates of the digital humanities. There are strong parallels between Binkley's approach and the gains in public humanities that have arisen from the digitization of the artifacts of human culture. The ease of transmission and the relatively low-cost of delivery that digitized works allow has a democratizing effect on scholarship, engaging a much broader public in a range of scholarly activities.\n\nThe <a href=\"http://books.google.com/ngrams\" target=\"_blank\">Google Ngram Viewer</a> brought the idea of using computation to study culture to many who had previously been unaware of its potentials. The Ngram Viewer is based around a very simple idea: type in two or more words and you get a comparison of their occurrence in the Google Books corpora over time. A range of questions of interest to humanities scholars is possible: When did a word enter common usage? When did words fall out of favor? What is the historical trajectory of a concept in, for example, nineteenth-century politics? How much were people writing about a literary figure, or a work of fiction?\n\nThe paper critiques this and several other approaches to the use of big data in the analysis of texts - including <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/26/books/review/the-mechanic-muse-what-is-distant-reading.html?pagewanted=all\" target=\"_blank\">Franco Moretti's 'Distant Reading'</a> of literary history - and then builds on these to argue for 'scalable' textual scholarship. Scalability in this context utilizes new computational approaches that allow for the interrogation of massive text objects far beyond the capability of the individual reader, while simultaneously allowing for traditional forms of close reading. Rather than only providing the opportunity for abstraction of many texts it should be possible for scholars to investigate closely the component parts that the computer utilized in obtaining the abstraction. For every step away from the text the scholar will be provided with the means to step back into the text and see the passage, stanza or phrase that is represented in the abstraction.",

Kress Foundation in support of a planning meeting for a major symposium entitled <a href=\"https://mith.umd.edu/research/art-history-digital-dimensions/\">Art History in Digital Dimensions</a>, to be held in College Park and Washington, DC in the fall, 2015. The Steering Committee for the symposium, which includes faculty and students from the University of Maryland and distinguished international scholars in art history and the digital humanities, will be meeting in November, 2014, to determine the agenda of the symposium. A key goal of this initiative is to develop and publicize principles and practical guidelines for the future of graduate training in the digital humanities, art history, and museology, and to consider these in light of such themes as cultural rights/human rights, and scholarly and artistic practice in a collaborative context. Events at the symposium will be guided by principles established at the planning meeting that address critical issues for art history in the digital world and in the public sphere. This initiative builds on the Kress Foundation’s impressive record in the sphere of digital art history.\n\n\n\nThe planning meeting will take place on November 19 – 20, 2014, in the Michelle Smith Collaboratory for Visual Culture in the Department of Art History and Archaeology. For more information, please contact Meredith J. Gill, Chair, Department of Art History and Archaeology (<a href=\"mailto:mgill@umd.edu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">mgill@umd.edu</a>) and Neil Fraistat, Director, Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (<a href=\"mailto:fraistat@umd.edu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fraistat@umd.edu</a>).",

    "wp post content": "The comments on the <a href=\"http://www.digitalmishnah.org\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Mishnah</a> demo deserve a full response (although the short response is: thank you and, in almost all cases, I agree). However, for this post I want to report on progress in getting and identifying texts for the extended demo. We have made the decision to build out from the sample chapter in Bava Metsi’a to all of tractate Neziqin (the “Bavot”), a 30-chapter and 13-14,000-word base text to work with.\n\nMichael Krupp has generously provided transcriptions of 4 orders for three manuscripts (Kaufmann, Parma de Rossi 138, and Cambridge Add. 470.1). The first is now available in an <a href=\"http://kaufmann.mtak.hu/en/ms50/ms50-coll1.htm\">electronic version</a> that is far better than what was available to Krupp when the transcriptions were made. The Cambridge ms  is presumably based on the edition of it by Lowe in the nineteenth century, and the Cambridge Libraries reported recently that that manuscript would be available on line. (At least, that’s what the Genizah Unit said on Facebook on July 4.) So there is room for improving the texts and resources available to do so. This should facilitate making substantial blocks of text available rather quickly. The problem is actually finding the time to encode the texts …\n\nMeanwhile, with the participation of Lieberman Institute, under the direction of Shamma Friedman and the aid of Leor Jacoby, I am gradually filling out the corpus of texts available. I say gradually not because the work on the part of the Institute transcribers is slow. However, our agreement is for transcribers to provide transcriptions, and I see to the conversion to XML.\n\nThose in the “biz” know that Yad Izhak Ben-Zvi and the Friedenberg Genizah Project recently published a three volume Thesaurus of Talmudic Manuscripts, edited by Sussman. The detailed information on joins makes it easier to prioritize fragments to transcribe. (It also leaves me feeling “scooped,” since my discoveries of joins were in most cases, possibly in all, anticipated by the Thesaurus, which was not yet available when I started working on this project.) On the basis of that catalog, the number of distinct shelfmarks for witnesses (once we include all the fragments of joined manuscripts where one or more fragment has text in the Bavot) runs to 200.\n\nSo, aside from wondering about next steps on the application that will drive the edition, I am drowning in texts. Happily, but drowning nonetheless.\n\n<em>Hayim Lapin is Robert H. Smith Professor of Jewish Studies and Professor in the Department of History at the University of Maryland.

    "wp post content": "MITH is very pleased to announce a new <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/research/miths-vintage-computers/\">Web site </a> devoted to its sizable (and growing) collection of vintage computers, retro software, and other artifacts from the early era of personal computing. The centerpiece of the site is a a considered metadata and modeling approach to computing hardware, whereby individual components of the vintage machines are documented, contextualized within their relation to the system as a whole, and expressed using Dublin Core. The site gathers links to other recent MITH projects in born-digital cultural heritage, and serves as a clearing house for our expanding portfolio in this area. It also includes newly written non-specialist's documentation for the FC5025 Floppy Disk Controller, a device used to retrieve data off of obsolescent media formats.\n\nThe site is presented using the content management tool Omeka. It was researched and designed by Walker Sampson, who recently completed an MLS from the School of Information at the University of Texas; Sampson was in residence at MITH this past summer under the auspices of the IMLS-sponsored Digital Humanities Model Internship Program. MITH's Associate Director Matthew Kirschenbaum comments, \"This site demonstrates the role that vintage computing can have in the environment of an active digital humanities center; as born-digital cultural heritage becomes ever more important, centers such as MITH will play a part alongside of libraries and archives in addressing its long-term presentation and curation.\"",

After an erroneous tip called into law enforcement authorities in 2002, Elahi was subjected to an intensive post 9-11 investigation by the FBI. After undergoing six months of interrogations and nine consecutive lie-detector tests, he was cleared of suspicions. After this harrowing experience, Elahi conceived \"Tracking Transience\" (http://trackingtransience.net), a self-tracking system that constantly and publicly presents his exact location, activities, and other personal data. This self-surveillance project is a critique of contemporary investigative techniques and provides an ongoing \"alibi\" for Elahi in the event of future accusations.\n\nHASAN ELAHI is an interdisciplinary artist whose work examines issues of surveillance, simulated time, transport systems, borders and frontiers. His work has been presented in numerous exhibitions at venues such as SITE Santa Fe, Centre Georges Pompidou, Sundance Film Festival, Kassel Kulturbahnhof, and at the Venice Biennale. Elahi recently was invited to speak about his work at the Tate Modern, The Einstein Forum, and at at the American Association of Artificial Intelligence. His work has been supported with grants and sponsorships from the Creative Capital Foundation, Ford Foundation/Philip Morris, and the Asociación Artetik Berrikuntzara in Donostia-San Sebastián in the Basque Country/Spain. His work is frequently in the media and has been covered by The New York Times, Forbes, Wired, CNN, ABC, CBS, NPR, Al Jazeera, Fox, and has also appeared on The Colbert Report. In 2009, he was Resident Faculty and Nancy G. MacGrath Endowed Chair at Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture and is a 2010 Alpert/MacDowell fellow. Currently, he is Associate Professor of Art at University of Maryland.\n\nView MITH’s complete Fall Speakers Schedule here:\n\n<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20111121205902/http://mith.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_fall_2010.pdf\">http://mith.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_fall_2010.pdf</a>\n\nAll talks free and open to the public!\n\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (http://mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-8927).",

My role was to translate the strategy for digital stewardship that Trevor outlined into the design process Kirsten was heading up while coordinating my research through MITH’s records with the work that Porter was doing to locate and reorganize legacy data from different websites and projects that had become obsolete or been decommissioned but were still being stored on MITH’s old servers. Throughout the process, I drew on some of my archival training to consider issues of appraisal and documentation. Also, as MITH’s project manager, I focused on communication and transparency to keep everyone collaborating efficiently.\n\n\n\nA crucial insight—which we only recognized once we were well into the project—is that what we were doing with the “Research” page was less a redesign of existing content than it was a fundamental shift in how we conceive of this part of MITH’s web presence: to encompass a data curation mission. We were creating something new with this iteration of the “Research” page because MITH had never intended to use the website as a complete catalogue of all of the center’s many projects. As you can see browsing through the old versions of the site, what has become the “Research” page started out as something more like news: “What is MITH working on these days?” The purpose of creating pages for different projects and linking out to their other manifestations on the web was and is, first about publicity. We want people who hear a talk or read a blog post to be able to search for more information and find some kind of information about a project on our site. Successive redesigns grouped this information together and started using “research” or “projects” as part of the information architecture of the site. We can be pretty confident that no one set out to create a public catalogue or registry of MITH projects and websites. So, capturing a fuller picture of MITH’s output over the years is a mission that the website has grown into along with MITH’s own longstanding commitment to digital stewardship and to representing the history of digital humanities as a field. As part of this growing process, we’ve added a lot more metadata fields to the content management system that runs this site, we’ve collated and cross-referenced data that wasn’t previously part of the site, and we’ve worked to organize the data and make it available through a new, more usable interface.\n\n<h4>MITH's Data: Record Retention and Appraisal</h4>\n\nFirst, there was a need for the consolidation and cross-referencing of data related to the history of MITH’s DH scholarship. Although we did have individual project pages online for the vast number of current and former MITH projects, we also knew that projects may have become less publicly visible over time for such reasons as sites becoming vulnerable to hacking and needing to be taken offline; side effects of past site migrations and upgrades; staff turnover leading to knowledge gaps or miscommunication about project updates; and no doubt, inevitably, some oversight/human error.\n\n\n\nTo start the process of gathering and updating data about MITH’s research, I started making a list of locations where MITH history was located:\n\n<ol>\n\n\t<li>The current MITH website;</li>\n\n\t<li>Past iterations of the MITH website on the Wayback Machine;</li>\n\n\t<li>MITH’s electronic records;</li>\n\n\t<li>MITH’s paper records in Special Collections/University Archives;</li>\n\n\t<li>Former MITH Research tracking documents.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\nRecord retention is a tricky business in general, as is the appraisal of an organizational record. I liked to keep in mind <a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/research/alic/reference/archives-resources/appraisal-conclusions.html\" target=\"_blank\">Dennis Meissner’s warning</a> that “too great an abstraction is an evil,” suggesting that an imaginative archivist could find some reason for the retention of every document, thus reducing appraisal to the level of an intellectual game. We cannot retain everything. Despite always having data curation and archiving experts on staff or working with us, there has never been a dedicated MITH Archivist. As with most organizations, the decision to keep or discard institutional records is often a choice made in a particular moment, mostly factoring in current assessments of need. So while we have a fairly complete portrait of our activities taking in all of the above five sources, that portrait had to be painstakingly assembled over a series of months.\n\n\n\nI downloaded all available project and event metadata from the current MITH Wordpress site and set it up in a dedicated shared spreadsheet. Then the MITH staff met and talked through our ideas about the design of the revamped interface, determining what an ideal set of core project metadata elements would be, and what information would display where on the new site. We looked at what metadata was already present on the site, and Kirsten created a separate tab on the spreadsheet to track existing and new metadata elements.\n\n\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_17248\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"387\"]<img class=\"wp-image-17248 \" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/DISC-Web-Components-735x980.jpg\" alt=\"DISC Web Components\" width=\"387\" height=\"516\" /> Archival documentation found in MITH's paper archives: An early outline of possible components for the Disability Studies Academic Community (DISC) website.[/caption]\n\n\n\nThe easiest additions were projects which had been on former versions of the MITH site, now archived in the Wayback Machine. Since the descriptions and information in these had already been curated and vetted by former MITH staff, it was typically in fine shape for porting over as-is, filling in holes with other research. MITH’s electronic records provided much of the information about post-2009 projects that needed additional metadata.\n\n\n\nAmong MITH’s records were a number of different “tracking documents,” for example, documentation of the contents of a server as of a particular month and year. These could be helpful, but they were often created to serve a very specific purpose so they could also serve to obfuscate research conclusions, particularly in instances where there was evidence of a development site for a project which never came to fruition, or was only there to test out alternative versions of a current site. File paths from these documents were helpful in working with Porter to track down projects on legacy servers, but then I often had to track down all the basic metadata on a project in the MITH paper records.\n\n\n\nThe MITH paper records were a particular challenge because a) they were interesting and could lead to distracting perusal of old correspondence and documentation, and b) because they contained entire folders on projects which got very far in the development process but never came to fruition.. Often folders for projects that did come to fruition contained all the same types of records and data, so unless I checked in with the project director it was difficult to determine when to stop going down the rabbit hole.\n\n<h4>Disambiguation and Taxonomies</h4>\n\nThe process of cycling through all of the above sources tended to be iterative, requiring back- and-forth rechecking and cross-referencing of conflicting data. But in the end I filled in all the new metadata elements for current projects, and added the full set of metadata elements for a total of 24 projects that will be getting “new” representation in our redesigned research-page-as-catalog.\n\n\n\nWhen it came to enabling visitors to benefit from all of this data curation, Raff pitched in to develop a small Javascript application for the “Research” page to enable faceted browsing. For example, although projects often refer to the funder/sponsor in the description text, we’d never tracked that data in a separate field. And, although we’d used tags to assign keywords to specific projects, the main reason for using the tags was to connect a project page to related blog posts. Over time the list of tags had become a bit spotty and random. So, if a user wanted to explore the history of awarded MITH grant projects and then filter down on specific research topics, this information would need to be populated throughout all current MITH projects as well as projects we added through the consolidation process. To facilitate this, we developed a new, hierarchical taxonomy of Topic tags in a third spreadsheet tab. You can see the result of this re-tagging and re-organization through the options for faceted browsing on the left-hand side of the new “Research” page.\n\n<h4>Conclusions &amp; Takeaways</h4>\n\nThis process was rewarding in that I acquired a unique vantage point on MITH’s history, including the quantification and distinction of types of research we’ve really specialized in over the years. There were also many fascinating insights, such as learning about MITH’s role in the development of early online educational technology (see the <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/research/spainonline/\" target=\"_blank\">Spain/Online</a> project), and MITH’s role in helping develop Disability Studies as a recognized academic discipline (<a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/research/disc-a-disabilities-studies-academic-community/\" target=\"_blank\">DISC: A Disability Studies Academic Community</a>). Lastly, I was delighted to learn more about MITH’s history organizing spoken word poetry events involving the community (read about the <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/research/gwendolyn-brooks-poetry-slam/\" target=\"_blank\">Gwendolyn Brooks Poetry Slam</a> in 2004, which featured the involvement of local high school students, and a community Q&amp;A with Irvin Kershner, director of the Empire Strikes Back, after a public screening of the film.\n\n\n\nWith the new interface going live in conjunction with the latest redesign of the MITH website, I hope that our community finds as much inspiration digging into MITH’s history as I have.[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]",

The challenge today is to design fields that are accessible across barriers of language, culture and immediate intent: we are beginning to design fields for translation, customization and personalization. This talk looks at the interaction between wholly automated and largely general systems and the knowledge structures on which particular domains depend.\r\r\n\r\r\nOn the one hand, we need to update our models of intellectual activity to keep pace the already present and rapidly emerging practices. At the same time, as we identify new services to support new activities, we need to develop methods whereby we can mine the machine actionable data from vast libraries of legacy print data available as page images and scalable accept user contributions of every type. One goal in the next five years is to have available for speakers of Arabic and Chinese the core data about Greco-Roman culture and then to make available corresponding materials about Chinese and Arabic culture to the English speaking public. This involves a suite of data driven services that provide high performance results for particular domains.\r\r\n\r\r\nGREGORY CRANE is Professor of Classics and Winnick Family Chair of Technology and Entrepreneurship at Tufts University. He is also the founder and director of the Perseus Project, which has been working on digital libraries and cyberinfrastructure for twenty years. He is directing projects aimed at developing a coherent cyberinfrastructure for cultural heritage in general and for Greco-Roman culture in particular.\r\r\n\r\r\nThis talk concludes MITH's Digital Dialogues series for the semester. It is free and open to the public.\r\r\n\r\r\nIt's not too late to register for Digital Diasporas, the first conference devoted exclusively to the intersection of African American/African Diaspora Studies and the digital humanities: http://web.archive.org/web/20100608231719/http://www.mith2.umd.edu/diaspora2008/\r\r\n\r\r\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-8927).",

    "wp post content": "The University of Maryland is pleased to announce the receipt of an NEH Digital Humanities Start-Up award, \"Approaches to Managing and Collecting Born-Digital Literary Materials for Scholarly Use.\" The project, directed by Matthew Kirschenbaum, Associate Professor of English at the University of Maryland, will involve a series of site visits and planning meetings among personnel working with the born-digital components of three significant collections of literary material: the Salman Rushdie Papers at Emory University's Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Book Library (which includes Rushdie's laptops), the Michael Joyce Papers at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin, and the Deena Larsen Collection at the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) at the University of Maryland. The meetings and site visits will facilitate the preparation of a larger collaborative grant proposal among the three institutions aimed at developing archival tools and best practices for preserving and curating the born-digital documents and records of contemporary literary authorship.\r\n\r\nAccording to Kirschenbaum, \"Today nearly all literature is born-digital in the sense that before it is ever printed as a book the text is composed with a word processor, saved on a hard drive or other electronic storage media, and accessed as part of a computer operating system. This new technological fact about writing means that an author working today will not and cannot be studied in the future in the same way as writers of the past, since the basic material evidence of their creative activity--manuscripts and drafts, working notes, correspondence, journals--is, like all textual production, increasingly migrating to the electronic realm. We look forward to the process of examining how to best meet these challenges, balancing the needs of both scholarship and archives in the new textual environment.\"\r\n\r\nStephen Enniss, Director of the Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Book Library at Emory, notes \"The born-digital archive not only contains enormous data, it also contains enormous potential for literary scholars to pose new questions of the archive not even contemplated in the past.\" Thomas F. Staley, Director of the Ransom Center, comments \"The Ransom Center is very pleased to be part of this vitally important project to explore how we can best preserve and make accessible the map of an author's creative process in the digital age. This collaborative effort between the Ransom Center, MITH, and Emory will help lead the way in the preservation of born-digital materials and ensure that these materials are available to students and scholars for generations to come.\" Neil Fraistat, Director of MITH, adds \"This project will deepen MITH's focus on the preservation and analysis of born digital literary artifacts, which is already well established in its work with the Electronic Literature Organization and on an NDIIPP funded project on the preservation of virtual worlds.\"\r\n\r\nOther project participants include Erika Farr (Emory), Naomi Nelson (Emory), Kari Kraus (Maryland), Catherine Stollar Peters (New York State Archives), and Gabriela Redwine (Ransom Center).\r\n\r\nFurther Inquiries:\r\n\r\nMatthew Kirschenbaum\r\n\r\nAssociate Professor of English\r\n\r\nAssociate Director,\r\n\r\nMaryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH)\r\n\r\nUniversity of Maryland\r\n\r\n301-405-8505\r\n\r\nmgk at umd dot edu",

This work is part of a collaboration between the <a href=\"https://lakelandchp.com/\">Lakeland Community Heritage Project (LCHP)</a>, the University of Maryland’s Department of American Studies, and MITH.\n\n\n\nEight students will work with us this summer—four from the Lakeland community and four from local schools and universities. The students are receiving 8 hours of training introducing them to the history of Lakeland and the LCHP and learning oral history methods they will use to conduct interviews. The project will follow a template that Project Director Dr. Mary Corbin Sies has previously used with classes as part of her long-term investment in working with the Lakeland community. In addition to Sies, Ms. Violetta Sharps Jones, a local historian and LCHP board member, MITH’s Stephanie Sapienza, Dr. Asim Ali, a Lecturer and ethnographer from the Department of American Studies, and Ashleigh Coren, Special Collections Librarian for Teaching and Learning, at the University of Maryland Libraries are all contributing their expertise.\n\n\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_19708\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"980\"]<img class=\"size-large wp-image-19708\" src=\"https://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_2096-980x735.jpg\" alt=\"Group photo of interns and instructors for Lakeland oral history project\" width=\"980\" height=\"735\" /> Members of the Summer 2018 Lakeland Oral Histories team[/caption]\n\n\n\nAt our first session, Ms. Sharps Jones shared stories about Lakeland’s early history with the students. She explained Lakeland’s central geographic location among a group of small, interconnected African American communities along U.S. Route One in Prince George's County, MD. Because it was the location of the main African American high school in the county prior to 1950 and its easy access to train and trolley transportation, Lakeland became a natural gathering place for African American social and recreational activities.\n\n\n\nThe mission of the LCHP, a decade-old local historical society, is to preserve and share the history and heritage of Lakeland, which thrived until its self-contained cultural traditions and sense of place were undermined by social change and a devastating urban renewal program. Dr. Sies and the Department of American Studies have collaborated with LCHP since 2009, establishing an ongoing community-engaged project whose primary achievement is creation of <a href=\"https://lakeland.umd.edu/\">The Lakeland Digital Archive</a>. The partnership provides LCHP—an all-volunteer historical society—with student and faculty labor to help document and archive Lakeland's history while training students in an ethical and equitable practice of collaborative heritage research in which students assist Lakelanders to produce historical knowledge in their own voices.\n\n\n\nMITH joined the project in 2017 when we offered our experience with digital preservation and agreed to house and secure the Lakeland Digital Archive on MITH's servers. Our role now is to help make available the results of years of research by community members and UMD students documenting an historic African American community before and after segregation. Over the course of the past several months, MITH faculty Sapienza, Ed Summers, and Trevor Muñoz have worked with Sies and LCHP President Ms. Maxine Gross to inventory, organize, and augment metadata for objects already in the digital collection. We have organized two events with Lakelanders to crowdsource identification of subjects among the many photos in the collection.\n\n\n\nIn collaboration with members of the Lakeland community, MITH is facilitating a multi-year effort to redesign the archive website to make available the history of Lakeland in forms accessible to the community. The new oral histories that student researchers collect this summer will join the thousands of other items in this important digital resource.",

Our <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/digital-dialogues/schedule/\">Fall 2016 series</a> starts off strong with talks from our two newest hires, Assistant Director of Innovation and Learning <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/people/person/purdom-lindblad/\">Purdom Lindblad</a>, and Director of the <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/research/synergies-among-digital-humanities-and-african-american-history-and-culture/\">AADHum project</a> <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/people/person/catherine-knight-steele/\">Catherine Steele</a>. Then we will bring you five additional speakers from disciplines ranging from Film and Media, African American Studies and Literature, Medieval Conservation, and Museums and Material Culture.\n\n\n\nTo kick things off, we are holding our third annual Pre-Season Mixer on <strong>Tuesday September 27th at 12:30pm</strong>. We've held these mixers each year since 2014 to allow new students, faculty and members of the campus community to come meet MITH staff and our community of Digital Dialogues attendees, hear about the series, and get acquainted with what MITH does. We also want to hear about you - your research interests, your current projects (and dream project) in the digital scholarly humanities, and more. Attendees will be given the opportunity to give a 3-5 minute lightning talk to spark a discussion. Stay tuned for more information!\n\n\n\nThis season, four of our talks are being presented in conjunction with our Mellon-funded initiative, Synergies among Digital Humanities and African American History and Culture (AADHum): Catherine Steele, Ravon Ruffin, Sarah Patterson/Jim Casey, and Dana Williams/Kenton Rambsy.

Please join us for these two presentations.\r\n\r\n\"Yintong: the Chinese Phonological Database\"\r\n\r\nDAVID PRAGER BRANNER, Associate Professor of Chinese\r\n\r\nYintong is a database of Chinese historical phonology with a number of new search mechanisms. It is designed to make this arcane but important body of knowledge accessible to students and other non-specialists who can use it in the study of modern Chinese dialects, classical literature, and historical linguistics.\r\n\r\n\"The Steinschneider Bibliographical Database: Digitizing a Classic Reference Work for Arabic and Latin Premodern Philosophy, Science, Medicine, and Literature Translated into Hebrew\"\r\n\r\nCHIP MANEKIN, Associate Pofessor of Philosophy\r\n\r\nIn 1893 the Austrian Jewish scholar Moritz Steinschneider published the crowning achievement of a long and distinguished scholarly career -- a thousand page bibliographical essay (in German) entitled The Hebrew Translations of the Middle Ages, and the Jews as Transmitters. For over a century, the Hebrew Translations of the Middle Ages has been the primary reference source for medieval Jewish philosophy, science, medicine, and literature, translated from the Arabic and Latin into Hebrew. It is the classic work on the translation movement of the High Middle Ages from Arabic and Latin into Hebrew. Over a century old, it has never been translated, revised, or updated. The Steinschneider Bibliographical Database (SBD), a project of MITH and funded in part by an NEH collaborative grant, will be a fully searchable English translation, revision, and update of Steinschneider's work prepared by scholars in Germany, Israel, and the US that will be available to scholars on the world wide web. As part of the website scholars will be able to consult digital images of Steinschneider's own annotated copy of the original German, as well the fifteen-hundred page handwritten French memoire that preceded the German print edition.\r\n\r\nComing up @MITH, *Friday,* April 28th 9:30-12:00 in the McKledin Special Events Room (6137): A Morning of Discussion About Electronic Literature. In preparation for the Electronic Literature Organization's impending move to MITH (www.eliterature.org), two of the organization's directors, ALAN LIU (Professor of English, University of California Santa Barbara) and JOE TABBI (Professor of English, University of Illinois Chicago) will visit to present talks on the preservation and collecting of electronic literature, as well as a new curriculum (at Santa Barbara) to support its teaching.\r\n\r\nView MITH's complete Spring Speakers Schedule here:\r\n\r\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20100609001120/http://mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_spring_2006.pdf\r\n\r\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Acting Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-5896).",

    "wp post content": "“…it is a true hybrid collection. It is not just a collection of digital materials.” MITH Associate Director Matt Kirschenbaum\n\n<a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DLC_collage.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone\" title=\"DLC_Collection\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DLC_collage.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"475\" height=\"311\" /></a>\n\nBefore opening the display cases, you will be shown to the three-ring binder with <em>The Deena Larsen Collection </em>Finding Aid, if you haven’t already accessed the <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/larsen/about/about\" target=\"_blank\">electronic copy</a> (scroll down to “The Collection Finding Aid” heading). The materials are inventoried in a spreadsheet of 18 tabs with categories such as “Authors,” “Manuals,” “Hardware,” “Articles,” “Correspondence,” and “Course Materials.” Many of the tabs relate to a specific archival box or set of boxes in the cases. There is also a separate finding aid spreadsheet for the 800+ (and growing) 3.5 inch floppy disk agglomeration that represent the most numerous single media item in the <em>Deena Larsen Collection (DLC)</em>.\n\nThe finding aids are vital to the researcher first coming to the <em>DLC</em>. Once you begin to crack open the boxes and binders on the shelves, you are confronted by the broad scope of the collection. <em>The Deena Larsen Collection</em> contains nearly 400 articles clipped from various sources, known and unknown, with another 150+ printed from various Web sources; materials from a dozen conferences; a hand-full of bound computer manuals from the days before everything was electronic PDF files; and the boxes of disks containing work from Larsen and many other e-literature authors, in various drafts and stages of completion.\n\n<a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DLC_discs.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright\" title=\"DLC_discs\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DLC_discs_sm.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"329\" /></a>\n\nMaryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) Associate Director Matthew Kirschenbaum expects that most researchers will be drawn to the <em>DLC</em> for the array of e-literature to be found here. The disk boxes include hypertexts produced in HyperCard, StorySpace, and HTML. The authors represented include Stephanie Strickland, Judy Mallory, William Dickey, Bill Bly, and many others.\n\nThe collection also has disks with purchased and pirated copies of software. These may be useful as <em>DLC </em>researchers begin trying to access the files on the disks, if for instance, a dedicated work-station were loaded with the software of the era utilized by Larsen: HyperCard, MacWrite, MacPaint, Photoshop 4, etc.\n\nAs I noted in an earlier post, I was able to find a number of working versions of <em>Marble Springs, Second Edition</em> in the disk finding aid. However, some of these disks were not in the boxes. I searched through the boxes, and did not find them misfiled. Kirschenbaum told me that the MITH staff was able to successfully disk image about 70 percent of the 800+ disks cataloged. The remaining disks presented problems, either due to physical problems with the adding diskettes, or due to software incompatibility.\n\nAs I was working with the disk boxes, I thought that perhaps each box should have a box inventory sheet and an inventory control sheet, which would record instances of materials being checked out for research or preservation use. I have worked with such systems in other special collections, and have found it useful.\n\n<a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/DLC_disk_find_sample.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone\" title=\"DLC_disk_find_sample\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/DLC_disk_find_sample.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"475\" height=\"315\" /></a>\n\nWhile each disk has been cataloged, the description is at the disk level, meaning that the description in the finding aid is based on the information on the label. The MITH staffers have yet had the time to do a file level description of the contents of each disk. This task is of course made more difficult by the fact that the Mac operating systems of the time did not always record the source program for files. So there is no telling if the “doc” files on a disk were created in MacWrite or Microsoft Word. (Although, when I queried Deena Larsen via email during my visit to MITH she told me they were likely MacWrite.)\n\nAnd while each disk has been assigned an identifier, the same cannot be said for the articles and correspondence in the <em>DLC</em>. I think the Correspondence box could be improved with an ordered inventory and an identifier for each document. It may also be useful going forward to add a <em>DLC</em> identifying tag to materials, so it is clear where it came from. I am thinking here of the occasional document that gets left on the photocopier or scanner. A simple ID tag with the prefix “DLC” and the unique identifier would help the materials get returned to their proper home.\n\nCabinet and shelf numbering would also be helpful to future researchers. In my exuberance to look through the collection, I pulled out more than one box at a time, and found myself looking at the pictures I had taken to make sure I got things back in their proper places. (And that was after thesis advisor Jerry McDonough tweeted back to Kirschenbaum to make sure I tidied up after myself.)\n\nThe broad range of media types in this hybrid collection does present organizational challenges. The shower curtain, for instance, is too large to be stored in the display cases as they now exist. And the collection is growing. While I was there, I was allowed the chance to look through a box that Larsen had recently deposited. There are likely to be many more to come.\n\nThe <em>DLC</em> staff has a great start on collection organization, and with more use it can be made stronger for future researchers.\n\n<strong>Up next: </strong><em>Accessing the DLC from a Distance</em>\n\n<em>______________________________________________________________________\n</em>\n\nWant to schedule a visit to the <em>DLC</em>?

Williams Bldg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInteraction design centers on the ability for a person to absorb, react to, and act upon information inside computers. It is clear that the manipulation of bits is well served by the strategies and techniques of computer science and electrical engineering, but close scrutiny of the human side of that gap might help us fit minds as well as we optimize algorithms. The last good decade has seen much more focus on \"human I/O\" in the form of perception, but we can take even better advantage of the eye if we know how it feeds \"upstream\" sense-making processes. Red may be a visually salient danger warning--but not if it's a tulip in a field in Haarlem, or red type and ornaments in a centuries-old codex. We understand objects in context and reinterpret our perceptions in radically different ways depending on that context.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe center of my research and practice for the last five years has been the exploration of higher and higher mental processes--beyond sensation and perception to object recognition and cognition. Necessity has lately driven me even farther: all the way past semiotics to psycholinguistics, and finally the humanities. It has become an axiom for me that many interfaces are best driven to be consistent not with other interfaces, but the way people think about a specific task. And the best doors into that realm have been explorations in the plastic arts (how people use visual richness to differentiate among categories of information), poetry (using metaphor to tame abstract information), and perhaps even storytelling (to understand process and aid long-term retention). These human endeavors may have more to offer us on the level of technique than we realize.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis talk will structure these observations, support them with references from source materials outside computer domains (such as psycholinguistics and hermeneutics), and show examples of antique information visualization techniques which in many ways are much more sophisticated that what we do today. I will deconstruct as an example recently-completed work for the 2006-7 transition of the New York Stock Exchange to a half-human, half-electronic \"Hybrid Market;\" a design that has sped up brokers in their most fundamental task from 7 seconds to less than a second--a 15:1 speedup directly resulting from an application of these principles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** Workshop\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Domain- and Task-Specific Tools for the Humanities: We'll explore what's needed now, what's attainable.\"\r\n\r\nThursday, March 29, 10:00-12:30 MITH (B0131 McKeldin)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis workshop is an initial exploration of how KWIRQI design principles (Knowledge Work Interfaces: Reality-Quoting Interfaces) might be applied to the domain of research and criticism in literature. The heart of a KWIRQI design is the way it adopts jargon and metaphors from a very limited community of practice, \"quoting the reality\" of that community.  Here, we will be trying to isolate and understand what ideas are common in this domain, and what tasks might best be supported by the development of new computer-based tools for literature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI will lead the group in an enumeration of bits of jargon and discovery of common concept spatializations. For example, in the financial domain a \"high price\" is a large number; there is no a-priori reason to assume that a large number is \"up.\" But that pairing of a concrete adjective with an abstract noun tells us that traders have mapped numbers into space: specifically a vertical dimension in their minds. Remarkably, this mapping seems to happen in all knowledge work domains I have studied. We will search for these domain-specific implicit metaphors shared by critics and text analysts; for this reason it will be extremely valuable to have \"pre-digital\" researchers who have been practicing for many years: they carry the wealth of this local culture in their minds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe hope to justify their time by developing a listing of tasks that manipulate these concepts and metaphors then doing an economics-style tradeoff; ranking which tasks will help support the field the most, yet be easiest to implement and take best advantage of local university resources and expertise. We want to take the most tedious work they do and offload it to a computer, then present the results in exactly the way they would sketch them on a napkin to relate them to a student. The overall goal will be the creation of scope definitions and perhaps initial design sketches for tools that can be designed, built, and put into use in the immediate future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** Biography\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nW.

    "wp post content": "<em>This is the 4th post in <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/tag/mith-digital-stewardship-series/\">MITH's Digital Stewardship Series</a>. In this post Ed Summers discusses ways to align your content with the grain of the Web so that it can last (a bit) longer.</em>\n\n\n\nIf I had to guess I would bet you found the document you are reading right now by following a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink\">hyperlink</a>. Perhaps it was a link in a Twitter or Facebook status update that a friend shared? Or maybe it was a link from our <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/\">homepage</a>, or from some other blog? It’s even possible that you clicked on the URL for this page in an email you received. We’re not putting MITH URLs on the sides of buses, on signs, or in magazines (yet), but people have been known to do <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code\">that that sort of thing</a>. At any rate, we (MITH) are glad you arrived, because not all links on the Web lead somewhere. Some links lead into dead ends, to nowhere–to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404\">HTTP 404</a>. Here is how historian Jill Lepore describes the Web in her piece <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/cobweb\">The Cobweb</a>:\n\n<blockquote>The Web dwells in a never-ending present. It is—elementally—ethereal, ephemeral, unstable, and unreliable. Sometimes when you try to visit a Web page what you see is an error message: <em>Page Not Found</em>. This is known as <em>link rot</em>, and it’s a drag, but it’s better than the alternative.</blockquote>\n\nI like this description, because it hints at something fundamental about the origins of the Web: if we didn’t have a partially broken Web, where content is constantly in flux and sometimes breaking, it’s quite possible we wouldn’t have a Web at all.\n\n<h2>Broken By Design</h2>\n\nWhen Tim Berners-Lee created the Web at CERN in 1989 he had the insight to allow anyone to link to anywhere else. This was a significant departure from previous hypertext systems which featured link databases that ensured pages were interlinked properly. Even when the Web only existed on his NEXT workstation Berners-Lee was already thinking of a World Wide Web (WWW) where authors could create links without needing to ask for permission, just like they used words. Berners-Lee understood that in order for the Web to grow he had to cede control of the link database. Here is Berners-Lee writing about these early days of the Web:\n\n<blockquote>For an international hypertext system to be worthwhile, of course, many people would have to post information. The physicist would not find much on quarks, nor the art student on Van Gogh, if many people and organizations did not make their information available in the first place. Not only that, but much information -- from phone numbers to current ideas and today's menu -- is constantly changing, and is only as good as it is up-to-date. That meant that anyone (authorized) should be able to read it. There could be no central control. To publish information, it would be put on any server, a computer that shared its resources with other computers, and the person operating it defined who could contribute, modify, and access material on it. (Weaving the Web, p. 38-39).</blockquote>\n\nSo in a way the Web is necessarily broken by design--there is no central authority making sure all the links work. The Web’s decentralization is one of the primary factors that allowed it to germinate and grow. I don’t have to ask for permission to create <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot\">this link to Wikipedia</a> or to anywhere else on the Web. I simply put the URL in my HTML and publish it. Similarly, no one has to ask me for permission to link here. An obvious consequence of this freedom is that if the page I’ve linked to happens to be deleted or moved somewhere else, then my link will break.\n\n\n\nFast forward through 25 years of exponential growth and we have a Web where roughly<a href=\"http://idlewords.com/talks/web_design_first_100_years.htm\"> 5%</a> of the URLs collected using the social bookmarking site Pinboard break per year. URLs shared in social media are <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.3026\">estimated</a> to fare even worse with about 11% lost per year. In 2013 a group at Harvard University <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2329161\">discovered</a> that 50% of the links in Supreme Court opinions no longer link to the originally cited information. To paraphrase William Gibson, the past isn’t evenly distributed.\n\n\n\nThere is no magic incantation that will make your Web content permanent. At the moment we rely on the perseverance and care of Web archivists like the Internet Archive, or your own organization's Web archiving team, to collect what they can. Perhaps efforts like <a href=\"https://ipfs.io/\">IPFS </a>will succeed in layering new, more resilient protocols over or underneath the Web. But for now you are most likely stuck with the Web we’ve got, and if you’re like MITH, lots of it.\n\n\n\nFortunately, over the last 25 years Web developers and information architects have developed some useful techniques for working with this fundamental brokenness of the Web. I’m not sure if these are best practices as much as they are practical recipes. If you tend a corner of the Web here are some very practical tools available to you you for helping mitigate some of the risks of link rot.\n\n<h2>Names</h2>\n\n<blockquote>There are only <a href=\"http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html\">t</a>wo problems in computer science: cache invalidation, naming things and off-by-one errors. (Phil Karlton by way of <a href=\"http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html\">Martin Fowler</a>)</blockquote>\n\nNaming things is hard partly because of semantic drift. The things our names seem to refer to have a tendency to shift and change over time. For example if I create a blog at <em>wordpress.example.org</em> and a few years later decide to use a different blogging platform, I’m kind of stuck with a hostname that no longer fits my website. When creating content on the Web it's important to be attentive to the hostnames you pick for your websites. Unfortunately most of us don’t have time machines to jump in to see what the future is going to look like. But we do have memories of the often tangled paths that lead to the present state of a project. Draw upon these histories when naming your websites. Turn naming into a cooperative and collaborative exercise.\n\n\n\nNaming on the Web is ultimately about the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System\">Domain Name System</a> (DNS). DNS is a distributed database that maps a hostname like <em>mith.umd.edu</em> to its IP address 174.129.6.250, which is a unique identifier for a computer that is connected to the Internet. Think of DNS as you would your address book, which lets you look up the phone number or mailing address for a person you know using their name. When your friend moves from one place to another, or changes their phone number you update your address book with the latest information. Establishing a DNS name for your website like <em>mith.umd.edu</em> lets you move the actual machine around, say from your campus IT department, to a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services, which changes its IP address, but without changing its name. DNS is there to provide stability to the Web and the underlying Internet.\n\n\n\nDNS is <em>distributed</em> in that there are actually many, many address books or zones that are hierarchically arranged in a pyramid like structure, with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_root_zone\">one root zone</a> at the top. In the case of <em>mith.umd.edu</em> the address book is managed by the University of Maryland. In order to change the hostname <em>mith.umd.edu </em>to point at another IP address I would need to contact an administrator at UMD and request that it be changed. Depending on my trust relationship with this administrator they might or might not fulfill my request. Sometimes you might want to purchase a new domain for your site like <em>namingthingsishard.org </em>from a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Domain_registrars\">DNS Registrar</a>. After you paid the registrar an annual fee, you would be able to administer the address book yourself. But with great power comes great responsibility.\n\n\n\nGiven its role in making Internet names more stable it's ironic that DNS is often blamed as a leading factor for link rot. It’s true, if you register a new domain and forget to pay your bill, a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybersquatting\">cybersquatter</a> can snatch it up and hold it hostage. Alternative systems like <a href=\"https://www.handle.net/\">Handles</a>, <a href=\"http://www.doi.org/\">Digital Object Identifiers </a>and more recently <a href=\"https://namecoin.info/\">NameCoin</a> or <a href=\"https://ipfs.io/\">IPFS</a> have been developed partly out of an inherent distrust of DNS. These systems offer various improvements over DNS, but in some ways recapitulate the very problems that DNS itself was designed to solve. DNS has its warts, but it has been difficult to unseat because of its ubiquitous use on the Internet. Here are a few things you can do when working with DNS to keep your websites available over time:\n\n<ul>\n\n \t<li>Pick a hostname you and your team can collectively live with, at least for a bit. Think of it as a community decision.</li>\n\n \t<li>If your new website fits logically in a domain that you already have access to use it instead of registering a new domain name. This way you have no new bills to pay, or management to do.</li>\n\n \t<li>If you register a new domain keep your user registration account and contact information up to date. When a bill needs to be paid that’s who the registrar is going to get in touch with. When staff come and go make sure the contact information is changed appropriately.</li>\n\n \t<li>Pick a registrar that lets you lock the domain to prevent unwanted updates and transfers.</li>\n\n \t<li>If your registrar allows you to enable two-factor authentication do it. You’ll feel safer the next time you log in to make changes.</li>\n\n \t<li>If the creator of a website has moved on to other organization, transfer the ownership of the domain to them. They are the ones making sure it stays online so it makes sense for them to own and administer the domain.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Redirects</h2>\n\nA more practical solution than minting the perfect and unchanging name for your website is to accept that things change, and to let people know when these changes occur. An established way to announce a name change on the Web is to use the modest HTTP redirect. Think of an HTTP redirect as the forwarding address you give the post office when you move. The post office keeps your change of address on file, and forwards mail on to your new address, for a period of time (typically a year). The medium is different but the mechanics are quite similar, as your browser seamlessly follows a redirect from the old location of a document to its new location.\n\n\n\nThe Hypertext Transfer Protocol (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol\">HTTP</a>) defines the rules for how Web browsers and servers to talk to each other. Web browsers make HTTP requests for Web pages using their URL, and Web servers send HTTP responses to those requests. Each <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html\">type of response</a> has a unique three digit code assigned to it. I already mentioned the 404 Not Found error above, which is a type of HTTP response that is used when the server cannot locate a resource with the URL that was requested. When the server returns a 200 OK response the browser know everything is fine and that it can display the page. One of the other class of HTTP responses servers can send are redirects, such as 301 Moved Permanently and 302 Found.\n\n\n\n301 Moved Permanently is your friend in situations where a given website has moved to another location, as when a domain name is changed, or when the content of a website has been redesigned. Consider the example above when wordpress.example.org no longer works because another blogging platform is now being used. You can set up your webserver so that all requests for wordpress.example.org redirect permanently to blog.example.org.\n\n\n\nThe actual mechanisms for doing the redirect vary depending on the type of Web server you are running. For example, if you use the Apache Web server you can enable the <a href=\"https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/rewrite/remapping.html\">mod_rewrite</a> module and then put a file named .htaccess containing this in your document root:\n\n<pre>RewriteEngine On\n\nRewriteBase /\n\nRewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^wordpress.example.org$ [fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=\"yes\" overflow=\"visible\"][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=\"1_1\" background_position=\"left top\" background_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" border_color=\"\" border_style=\"solid\" spacing=\"yes\" background_image=\"\" background_repeat=\"no-repeat\" padding=\"\" margin_top=\"0px\" margin_bottom=\"0px\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_direction=\"left\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" center_content=\"no\" min_height=\"none\"][NC]\n\nRewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://blog.example.org/$1 [L,R=301]\n\n</pre>\n\nThe point of this example isn’t to explain how mod_rewrite or Apache work, but merely to highlight one way (among many) of doing a permanent redirect. Whatever webserver you happen to use is bound to support HTTP redirects in some fashion. When things move from one place to another try to let people know that the website has moved permanently elsewhere. When people visit the old location their browser will seamlessly move on to the new location. Web search engines like Google also will notice the change in location and update their index appropriately, since they don’t want their search results to send people down blind alleys. Consider creating a terms of service for your website where you commit to serving redirects for a period of time, say one year, to give people a chance to update their links.\n\n<h2>Proxies</h2>\n\nAnother pivot point for managing your Web content are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy\">reverse proxies</a>. Remember those HTTP requests and responses mentioned earlier? Reverse proxies receive HTTP requests from a client, forward them on to another server and then send the response they receive back to the original client. That's kind of complicated so here's an example. Recently at MITH we moved many of our web properties from a single machine running on campus to Amazon Web Services, a.k.a. The Cloud. We had many Wordpress, Drupal and Omeka websites running on the single machine and wanted to disaggregate them so they could run on separate Amazon EC2 instances. The reason for doing this was largely to allow them to be maintained independently of each other. We wanted to make this process as painless as possible by avoiding major changes to our URL namespaces. For example the MITH Vintage Computing Omeka site lived at:\n\n<blockquote>http://mith.umd.edu/vintage-computers/</blockquote>\n\nand we didn’t want to have to move it to somewhere like:\n\n<blockquote>http://omeka.mith.umd.edu/vintage-computers/</blockquote>\n\nCertainly the old locations could have been permanently redirected to the new locations for some period of time. But doing that properly for over 100 project websites was a bit daunting. Instead we chose to use a reverse proxy server called <a href=\"https://varnish-cache.org/\">Varnish</a> to manage the traffic to and from our new servers. An added benefit to using a reverse proxy like Varnish is that it will cache content where appropriate, which greatly improves user experience when pages have been previously requested. In fact speeding up websites is the primary use case for Varnish. Another advantage to using something like Varnish is that its configuration becomes an active map of your organization's Web landscape. You can use the configuration as documentation for the web properties you manage. Here’s a partial view of our setup now:\n\n\n\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-17606 aligncenter\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/image01-300x283.png\" alt=\"image01\" width=\"300\" height=\"283\" />\n\n\n\nReverse proxies are an extremely useful tool for managing your Web namespace. They allow you to present a simplified namespace of your websites to your users, while also giving you a powerful mechanism to grow and adapt your backend infrastructure over time.\n\n<h2>Cool URIs</h2>\n\nWhen a link breaks it’s not just the hostname or domain name in the URL that can be at fault. What is much more common is for the path or query components of the link URL to change. Unless a URL is for a website’s homepage almost all URLs have a path, which is the part that immediately follows the hostname, for example:\n\n<blockquote>http://mith.umd.edu<b>/vintage-computers/items/show/9</b></blockquote>\n\nThis URL identifies the record in our Vintage Computers website for this Apple IIe computer that has been signed by the author Bruce Sterling:\n\n\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-17607 size-full\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/image00.jpg\" alt=\"image00\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" />\n\n\n\nIn addition, a URL may have a query component, which is the portion of the URL that starts with a question mark. Here’s an example of a URL that identifies a search for the word apple in the Vintage Computing website:\n\n<blockquote>http://mith.umd.edu/vintage-computers/items/browse<b>?search=apple</b></blockquote>\n\nThe path and query portions of a URL are much more susceptible to change because they uniquely identify the location of a document on the Web server, or (more often the case) the type of Web application that is running on the server. Consider what might happen if we auction off the Apple IIe (never!) and delete record 9 from our Omeka instance. Omeka will respond with a 404 Not Found response. Or perhaps we upgrade the version of Omeka that uses a new search query such as ?q=apple instead of ?search=apple. In this case the URL will no longer identify the search results.\n\n\n\nEven though they are highly sensitive to change there are some rules of thumb you can follow to help insure that your URLs don’t break over time. A useful set of recommendations can be found in a document called <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html\">Cool URIs Don’t Change</a> written by Tim Berners-Lee himself back in 1998, which recommends you avoid URLs that contain:\n\n<ul>\n\n \t<li>filename extensions: http://example.org/search<strong>.php</strong></li>\n\n \t<li>application names: http://example.org/<strong>omeka</strong>/</li>\n\n \t<li>access metadata: http://example.org/<strong>public</strong>/item/1</li>\n\n \t<li>status metadata: http://example.org/<strong>drafts</strong>/item/1</li>\n\n \t<li>user metadata: http://example.org/<strong>timbl</strong>/notes/</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nIronically enough the URL for Cool URIs Don’t Change is <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html\">http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html</a> which is counter to the first recommendation since it uses the .html filename extension. Remember, these are not hard and fast rules--they are simply helpful pointers to things that are more susceptible to change in URLs.\n\n\n\nIn fact you may have already heard of Cool URIs by a more popular name: <em>permalinks</em>. In 2000, Just as blogging was becoming popular, Paul Bausch, Matt Howie and Ev Williams at Blogger needed a way to reference older posts that had cycled off a a blog’s homepage. Necessity was the mother of invention, and so the idea of the permalink was born. A permalink uniquely identifies a blog post which can be used when referencing older content in the archive. The idea is now so ubiquitous it is difficult to recognize as the innovation it was then.\n\n\n\nWhen you create a post on WordPress, or send a tweet on Twitter your piece of content is automatically assigned a new URL that others can use when they want to link to it. The permalink was put to work in 2001 when Wikipedia launched, and every topic got its own URL There are not close to 5 million articles in English Wikipedia now. Previously many websites shrouded their URLs with complex query strings, which exposed the internals of the programs that made the content available, and lent to their transience. Clean URLs inspire people to link to them with some expectation that they will be managed and persistent. Consider these two examples:\n\n<blockquote>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permalink</blockquote>\n\nand:\n\n<blockquote>https://twitter.com/jack/status/20</blockquote>\n\ncompared with:\n\n<blockquote>http://www.example.com/login.htm?ts=1231231232222&amp;st=223232&amp;page=32&amp;ap=123442&amp;whatever=somewordshere</blockquote>\n\nWhen you are creating your website it’s a good idea to be conscious of the URLs you are minting on the Web. Do they uniquely identify content in a simple and memorable way? Can you name the types of resources that the URL patterns will identify? Could you conceivably change the Web framework or content management system being used without needing to change all the URLs? Consider creating a short document that details how your organization uses its URL namespaces, and its commitment to maintaining resources over time. You won't be going out on a limb, because these ideas aren't particularly new: check out what Dan Cohen and Roy Rosenzweig said over 10 years ago about <a href=\"http://chnm.gmu.edu/digitalhistory/designing/5.php\">Designing for the History of the Web</a> in their book <a href=\"http://chnm.gmu.edu/digitalhistory/\">Digital History</a>.\n\n<h2>Web Archives</h2>\n\nIn his <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/stewarding-digital-humanities-work-on-the-web-at-mith/\">first post</a> in this series Trevor referred to the distinction between active and inactive records in archival theory, and how it informs MITH’s approach to managing its Web properties. Active records are records taht remain in day to day use by their creators. Inactive records on the other hand are largely kept for historical research purposes. An analogy can be made here to dynamic and static websites. Both types of websites are important, but each has fundamentally different uses, architectural constraints and affordances.\n\n\n\nOver the last 15 years MITH has used a variety of Web content management systems (CMS) as part of our projects: Drupal, WordPress, Omeka, MediaWiki, and even some homegrown ones. CMS are very useful during the active development of a project because they make it easy for authenticated users to create and edit of Web content using their Web browser. But at a certain point a project transitions (slowly or quickly) into maintenance mode. All good grant funding must come to an end. Key project participants can move on to new projects and new jobs at other institutions. The urgent need for the project to have a dynamic website can be reduced, over time, to basically nothing. The website’s value is now as a record of past activity and work, rather than the purpose it was initially serving.\n\n\n\nWhen you notice this transition in the life cycle of one of your projects there’s an opportunity to take a snapshot of the website so that the content remains available, and preserve what there is of the server side code and data. The venerable wget command line utility can create a mirror of a website. Here’s an example command you could use to harvest a website at http://example.com/app/\n\n<pre>     wget --warc-file example\n\n          --mirror \\\n\n          --page-requisites \\\n\n          --html-extension \\\n\n          --convert-links \\\n\n          --wait 1 \\\n\n          --execute robots=off \\\n\n          --no-parent \\\n\n          http://example.com/app/\n\n</pre>\n\nOnce the command completes you will see a directory called example.com that contains static HTML, JavaScript, CSS and image files for the website. You should be able to take the contents of the directory and move it up to your server as a static representation of the website. In addition you will have an example.warc.gz that contains all the HTTP requests and responses that went into building the mirror. The WARC file can be transferred to a web archive viewing application like the Wayback Machine or pywb for replay.\n\n\n\nOne caveat here is that this snapshot will be missing any server side functionality that was present and not browsable via an HTML hyperlink. So for example a search form will no longer work, because it was dependent on a user entering in a search query into a box, and submitting it to the server for processing. Once you have a static version of your website the server side code for performing the query, and generating the results, will no longer be there. To simplify the user experience you may want to disable any of this functionality prior to crawling. If giving up the server side functionality compromises the functionality of the snapshot it may not be suitable for archiving in this way.\n\n\n\nIf your institution subscribes to a web archiving service provider such as ArchiveIt you may be able to nominate your website for archiving. Once the site has been archived you can redirect (as mentioned earlier) traffic to the new location provided by your vendor. Additionally you can rely on what is available of your website at Internet Archive. Although you may need to do some work to verify that all the content you need is there. Both approaches will require you to make sure your website’s robots.txt is configured to allow crawling so that the Web archiving bots can access all the relevant pages.\n\n<h2>Static Sites</h2>\n\nWhat if it wasn’t necessary to archive websites. What if they were designed to be more resistant to change? In the early days of the Web people composed static HTML documents by hand. It was easy to view source, copy and paste a snippet of HTML, save it in a file, and move it up to a webserver for the world to read. But it didn’t take long before we were creating server side programs to generate Web pages dynamically based on content stored in databases and personalized services like authentication and user preferences. While the dynamic, server side driven Web is still prevalent, over time there has been a slight shift back towards so called static websites for certain use cases.\n\n\n\nFor example when the New York Times <a href=\"http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/20/using-flat-files-so-elections-dont-break-your-server/\">needed</a> to respond to thousands of requests per second for results on election night they used static websites. When healthcare.gov was being launched to educate millions of people about the Affordable Care Healthcare Act in 2013 the only part of the site with 100% uptime was the thousands of pages being managed as a static website. When lots of people come looking for a page it’s important not to need to connect to a database, query it, and generate some HTML using the query results. This is known as the so called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundering_herd_problem\">thundering herd problem</a>. The less moving parts there are, the faster the page can be sent to the user.\n\n\n\nStrangely the same property of simplicity that is useful for performance reasons has positive side effects for preservation as well. The server side code that talks to databases to dynamically build HTML or JSON documents is extremely dependent on environmental conditions such as: operating system, software libraries, programming language, computational and network resources, etc. This code is often custom made, configured for the task at hand and can contain undiscovered bugs that compromise functionality and security. Even when using off the shelf software like WordPress or Drupal it’s important to keep these Web applications up to date, since spammers and crackers scan the Web looking for stale versions to exploit.\n\n\n\nRead only static sites largely sidestep these problems since the only software that is being used are a Web browser and a Web server (which is running in its simplest mode, serving up documents). Both are battle tested by millions of people every day. Of course it’s not really practical to hand code an entire website in HTML so now there are now many different static site generators available that build the site once using templates, includes, configuration files and plugins for various things. Once built the website can be made available very easily by copying the files to a Web server which makes them available. <a href=\"https://www.staticgen.com/\">StaticGen</a> is a directory of static site generators that lists over 100 projects for 25 different programming language environments.\n\n\n\nThe next time you are creating a website ask yourself if you absolutely need the site to be dynamic. Can you automatically generate your site using a tool like Jekyll, and layer in dynamic functionality like commenting with Disqus, search with Google Site Search. If these questions are intriguing you may be interested in a relatively new Digital Humanities community group for <a href=\"http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/\">Minimal Computing</a>.\n\n<h2>Export</h2>\n\nThe last lever I’m going to cover here is data export. If you decide to build your website using a content management system (Wordpress, Drupal, Omeka, etc) or a third party provider (Twitter, Facebook, Medium, Tumblr, SquareSpace, etc) be sure to explore what options are available for getting your content out. Wordpress for example lets you export your site content as an augmented RSS feed known as <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Tools_Export_Screen\">WXR</a>. Twitter, Facebook and Medium allow you to download a zip file, which contains a miniature static site of all your contributions that you can open with your browser.\n\n\n\nBeing able to export your content from one site to the next is extremely important for the long term access to your data. In many ways the central challenge we face in the preservation of Web content, and digital content generally, is the recognition that each system functions as a <a href=\"http://www.ngda.org/docs/Pub_Janee_IJDC_09.pdf\">relay</a> in a chain of systems that make the content accessible. As the aphorism goes: <a href=\"http://redmonk.com/jgovernor/2007/04/05/why-applications-are-like-fish-and-data-is-like-wine/\">data matures like wine, applications like fish</a>. As you build your website be mindful of how your data is going in, and how it can come out, so it can get into the next system. If there is an export mechanism try it out and see how well it works. If you don’t have a clear story for how your content is going to come out, maybe it’s not a good place to put it.\n\n\n\nIt may seem obvious, and perhaps old school, but the simplest way for a website to export your data is to make it easily crawlable and presentable on the Web as a network of interlinked HTML documents. If you have a website that was designed with <a href=\"http://indiewebcamp.com/Longevity\">longevity</a> in mind a tool like wget can easily mirror it, and has the added benefit of making it crawlable by search engines like Google or services like the Internet Archive. Stanford University has created a <a href=\"https://library.stanford.edu/projects/web-archiving/archivability\">guide</a> for how to make your website archivable.\n\n<h2>Use Your Illusion</h2>\n\nHopefully this list of tools and levers for working with broken links on the Web have been helpful. It was not meant to be an exhaustive list of options that are available, but only as another chapter in a continuing conversation of how we can work on and with the Web while being mindful of sustainability and preservation. As Dan Connolly, one of the designers of the Web, once said:\n\n<blockquote>The point of the Web arch[itecture] is that it builds the illusion of a shared information space.</blockquote>\n\nThis illusion is maintained through the attention and craft of Web authors and publishers all around the world. Maybe you are one of them. As we put new content on the Web and maintain older websites, we are doing our parts to sustain and deepen this hope for universal access to knowledge. Our knowledge of the past has always been mediated by the collective care of those who care to preserve it, and the Web is no different.\n\n\n\n<em>Many thanks to Trevor Muñoz, Kari Kraus and Matt Kirschenbaum for reading drafts of this post and their suggestions.</em>[/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]",

    "wp post content": "Dear MITH Community,\r\n\r\nThose of you who have been following MITH's blog (http://www.mith2.umd.edu) know that this past year has been a busy and exciting time. I'd like to take a moment before the fall semester kicks into gear to review some of the highlights and provide some coming attractions, as it were.\r\n\r\n<strong>Events and Conferences</strong>\r\n\r\nLast spring MITH co-hosted \"Digital Diasporas,\" the first ever conference on the confluence between the Digital Humanities and African American/African Diaspora Studies. This year, in October, we will be co-hosting a two-day international digital tool workshop with George Mason's Center for History and New Media that is being sponsored by NSF, NEH, and IMLS. In June we will also be hosting \"Digital Humanities 2009,\" the joint annual conference of the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations, and the most significant one in its field.  Our keynote speakers will be Lev Manovich, from the University of California San Diego, and Christine Borgman from UCLA. For more information on DH 2009, you can visit our conference Website: http://www.mith2.umd.edu/dh09/, where you can also sign up for a Twitter feed.\r\n\r\nDuring the coming year, MITH staff will also be busy presenting at conferences. Among other engagements too exhausting to list or contemplate, MITH's Associate Director Matt Kirschenbaum will participate in the Presidential Forum at the Modern Language Association's annual convention, MITH's Assistant Director Doug Reside will be presenting papers at two international conferences in Great Britain, and I will be keynoting \"The 1st International Symposium on Digital Humanities for Japanese Arts and Cultures\" in Kyoto.\r\n\r\n<strong>Recent Grants</strong>\r\n\r\nMITH is on a roll! During the past year we've won six significant grants, continued work on two others, and are waiting to hear about several others.  Among these are projects funded by the Library of Congress, NEH, IMLS, NSF, and Mellon Foundation.  Our projects run the gamut from the building of digital tools, to the development of an electronic environment for Shakespeare's Quartos, to the creation of electronic editions of musical theatre, to the preservation of virtual worlds.  And our grant partners include the Folger Shakespeare Library, the British Library, the Bodleian Library, the Huntington Library, the National Library of Scotland, the Harry Ransom Center, Emory University, Stanford University, the University of Illinois, the Rochester Institute of Technology, and Linden Lab, the creators of Second Life. Great company to keep!\r\n\r\nWe've also done consulting for such local institutions as the National Archives, the State Department, the National Building Museum, and the National Gallery's Center for Advanced Study of the Visual Arts.\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Fellows</strong>\r\n\r\nI'm happy to say that MITH Fellows Angel David Nieves and Merle Collins made excellent progress on their projects, as did Zita Nunes, who was in her first year of fellowship. Built in partnership with the Hector Pieterson Memorial and Museum in Johannesburg, Angel's project, \"Soweto '76\" uses electronic multimedia to collect, preserve, and present the stories and digital records of those students who took part in the Uprisings of 1976. We have developed a geospatial interface for Soweto '76 and are in the midst of completing a three-dimensional, historically authentic model of the protest  march route. We're very sorry to see Angel depart Maryland for a new position at Hamilton College in New York, but he will be continuing his work as a Networked Fellow.\r\n\r\nMerle Collins's project, \"Saraka and Nation,\" will provide a multimedia archive including video and oral histories, in order to trace connections between cultures of Africans in the Americas and sites of memory in Africa.  Merle has now completed most of the video work and is working on the design and features of the online Website.\r\n\r\nZita Nunes spent her fellowship year as the primary organizer of the \"Digital Diasporas\" conference and creating the infrastructure for a digital archive of articles from the Afro-Brazilian Press, 1910-1970, that will be presented both in Portuguese and in her own English translation to foster comparative work on these materials, which have otherwise been available in English.\r\n\r\n<strong>MITH in the News</strong>\r\n\r\nThe table-read of the interactive fiction game ADVENTURE we hosted last May in conjunction with the Preserving Virtual Worlds project was covered in the Washington Post, as well as on various blogs. Likewise, MITH projects and activities are regularly covered on the various digital humanities blogs in the field, and Matt Kirschenbaum has established a regular publishing presence in the Chronicle of Higher Education.  For the campus community, watch for a major story on MITH in the next issue of the Faculty Voice.\r\n\r\n<strong>Staffing</strong>\r\n\r\nI am delighted to announce the recent hiring of eight extremely talented new staff members:  Christina Grogan, MITH's new Business Coordinator, who received her M.B.A. from the University of Tennessee, comes to us from the University of Maryland's Program in Neuroscience and Cognitive Science, where she was Program Coordinator. Grant Dickie, our new Web Programmer, comes to us from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, where he recently completed his M.A. in Information Science. And Emily Adamo, our new Web Designer, is a Web comics artist, whose most recent position was at the National Archives.\r\n\r\nOur other new staff members comprise a stellar group of Program Associates, drawn from the graduate student ranks of several programs on campus: Elizabeth Bonsignore (iSchool), Rachel Donahue (iSchool), James Hesla (Theatre), Arik Lubkin (Architecture), Kate Singer (English).\r\n\r\nWhen you're next at MITH, please stop by and wave hello. They'll probably be too busy to stop and chat - at least if I have anything to say about it!  For more information about MITH's entire staff, visit http://www.mith2.umd.edu/about/staff/.\r\n\r\n<strong>Digital Dialogues</strong>\r\n\r\nThere is, as I hope you've seen, much to be excited about in the coming year, including another full program of Digital Dialogues every Tuesday from 12:30 - 1:45, beginning on September 9, with a presentation by Doug Reside, on AXE, the multimedia markup tool he and a MITH team have developed. Other speakers will include Stan Katz (Princeton and ACLS), Brent Seales (University of Kentucky), Kathleen Fitzpatrick (Pomona College), and Joyce Ray (IMLS), as well as a number of our local area and campus colleagues.  Last year's Digital Dialogues frequently had standing room only crowds and we believe that this year's program is every bit as compelling.\r\n\r\nWe hope to see you all often in the coming year!\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nNeil",

I will talk about the Digital Docket project, an NSF-funded collaboration between University of Maryland's Government and Politics Department and the College of Information Studies, which aims to apply techniques from information retrieval and computational linguistics to the study of the U.S. Supreme Court.\r\r\n\r\r\nBy viewing the legal system as an intricate and complex web of communication, the project aims to better understand the role and influences of various actors through analysis of written records. Those records include, for example, briefs written by litigants and other stakeholders, and opinions written by judges and justices. The application of automated content analysis techniques to model the U.S. judicial system represents an opportunity to overcome many of the bottlenecks associated with traditional manual, labor-intensive methods in political science, and also provides a new environment for the advancement of information retrieval and computational linguistic techniques.\r\r\n\r\r\nJIMMY LIN is an assistant professor in the College of Information Studies (CLIS) at the University of Maryland, and is also a member of the Computational Linguistics and Information Processing (CLIP) laboratory in UMD's Institute for Advanced Computer Studies (UMIACS). He graduated with a Ph.D. in computer science from MIT in 2004. Jimmy's research lies at the intersection between information retrieval, natural language processing, and information science. In addition, he has also worked on theoretical linguistics at the syntax-semantic interface.\r\r\n\r\r\nThis is MITH's last Digital Dialogue of the semester! Look for our spring semester schedule soon.\r\r\n\r\r\nFree and open to the public.\r\r\n\r\r\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-5896).",

We can train a parser on Wall Street Journal text from the Penn Treebank, for example, and expect it to perform reasonably well on recent blog posts or movie reviews, but not necessarily on eighteenth-century conduct manuals. Unfortunately it's often hard to find or create appropriate training data for specific literary genres or historical periods, even in English. In this talk Travis Brown, Research &amp; Development Software Developer at MITH, will look at some examples of semi-supervised and unsupervised methods that can be used to explore large text collections in domains with little or no available training data.\n\nTRAVIS BROWN is a Research &amp; Development Software Developer at MITH. He holds an M.A. in English from the University of Texas at Austin and is beginning a dissertation on the use of digital tools and methods in literary studies. While at the University of Texas he worked as an editor for the Walt Whitman Archive and was the lead developer of eComma, a web application for collaborative textual annotation. He also participated in a range of projects in UT's Computational Linguistics Lab, where he developed tools for dependency parsing, semantic role labeling, and toponym resolution.

TILE, the Text Image Linking Environment, built on the existing code of MITH's NEH-funded AXE image tagger, will dramatically increase the ease and efficiency of this work. MITH Director Neil Fraistat comments, \"We're delighted that the NEH is supporting the further development of MITH's groundbreaking markup tool AXE and that Doug Reside, the developer of AXE, will be leading a distinguished multi-institutional team on the TILE project, along with Co-PI's Dot Porter of the Digital Humanities Observatory (Irish Royal Academy) and John Walsh of Indiana University.\"\n\nAt the end of two years, we will have produced software interoperable with other popular tools and capable of producing TEI-compliant XML for linking image to text and image to image with some level of automation.  We will also put the image linking features of the newest version of the Text Encoding Standard (TEI P5) through it's first rigorous, \"real world\" test, and, at the close of the project, expect to provide the TEI with a list of suggestions for improving the standard to make it more robust and effective. TILE will be developed and thoroughly tested with the assistance of our project partners, who represent some of today's most exciting image-based editions projects, in order to create a tool generated by the community, for the community, with the expectation that, unlike so many other tools, it will be used by the community. According to Reside, \"TILE attempts to create not just a set of tools but a methodology for generating truly useful software for humanities scholarship.\"\n\nStay tuned for yet <strong>more </strong>exciting news from MITH about future projects resulting from our recent grant activity!\n\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-8927).",

However, designing authoring tools that effectively integrate the discrete media-capture components of mobile devices to enable rich expression remains a challenge.  This presentation will provide a brief overview of collaborative technologies that support children’s storytelling, with a focus on mobile applications.  It will detail a 4-month study on the observed use of StoryKit, a mobile interface that integrates multimodal media-capture tools to support the creation of multimedia stories on an iPhone/iPod Touch.  The primary objectives of the study were to explore the ways in which applications like StoryKit enable families to create and share stories; and to investigate how the created stories themselves might inform the design of, and learning potential for mobile storytelling applications.  Its results suggest that StoryKit’s relatively simple but well-integrated interface enables the creation of vibrant, varied narratives.  Further, its portability supported the complementary co-construction and spontaneous, playful capture of stories by children and their trusted adults.\n\nBETH BONSIGNORE is a doctoral student at the University of Maryland's iSchool and a graduate research assistant at the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH), the Center for the Advanced Study of Communities and Information (CASCI), and the Human-Computer Interaction Lab (HCIL).  At MITH, she has enjoyed being a member of the talented Developers’ Cohort guided by MITH Associate Director, Doug Reside, and has been involved in database design for Shakespeare’s Quartos and TheatreFinder, a collaborative interface for scholars and aficionados of historic theatres.  Supported by an NSF EAGER grant under the direction of Kari Kraus (iSchool/ARHU) and Derek Hansen (iSchool/CASCI), she is exploring the potential of Alternate Reality Games (ARGs) to support the design of collaborative technologies for education.  Participatory design work with Allison Druin and the HCIL KidsTeam, a group of children aged 7-12 working to develop new technologies, is an integral part of her research, which lies at the intersection of New Media Literacies studies, technology development for collaborative sensemaking and storytelling, and social analytics for communities of learning.\n\nComing up @MITH March 30th: Nick Chen and Kari Kraus, \"Prototyping a Dual-Display e-Reader in the Literature Classroom\"\n\nView MITH's complete Fall Speakers Schedule here:\n\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20100608231200/http://www.mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_spring_2010.pdf\n\nAll talks free and open to the public!\n\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-8927).",

    "wp post content": "Often in working on a project, we tend to focus on the series of day-to-day tasks and the minutiae and forget the greater issues and implications inherent in what you are doing. What I appreciate about these blog posts is that they give us space to reflect upon our project, to evaluate our project's goals and to consider the numerous questions that arise while making a proposed archive an actual one. One of the benefits of being involved in an archival project from the ground up is in seeing just how many pieces must be assembled before the machine can start to work. From identifying our target data to collecting the raw materials to annotating texts to running them through OCR to collating everything, the entire process is carefully choreographed and organized in a methodical way. There is a way that these initial procedures may seem mechanical, automatic, devoid of imagination or emotion. However, in many ways, our archive is actually driven by sentiment and by emotion – both in the data that we collect and in the way we approach assembling the archive ourselves.\n\nI will start with the latter point. Reading my colleagues' posts, I was struck by the rich and insightful metaphors they use to conceptualize our project and our approach to it. FLA director Peter Mallios <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/beginnings/\" target=\"_blank\">compares us to seafaring explorers</a>, while editorial board member Jennifer Wellman <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/telling-the-story-of-foreign-literatures-in-america\" target=\"_blank\">relates us to storytellers</a>. Both of these comparisons connote imaginative expanses: in tales of exploration, discoveries are not just registered matter-of-factly, but rather with awe and emotion. There is a sense of play in data collection – while we have targeted texts in mind, it is often helpful to both wander in and wonder at the marvels of information out there. Indeed, while scanning materials recently, I found it interesting to stop thinking mechanically – to focus less on the list of articles to scan – and to instead think like Jennifer's storyteller, to consider the stories being told in these publications and how I might convey them. Storytelling is filled with, and even relies on, emotional resonance. Our archive can detail and present emotional arcs, and as we assemble the story of our archive, we encourage others to find their own arcs and to feel that same awe of exploration.\n\nOf course, the documents that we collect are not devoid of emotion – in fact, they are often based on emotion, as reception of authors is inherently emotionally fraught. This is not just the presentation of cold facts – this is the presentation of feelings, of emotions, that definitively affect an article's audience. This archive helps us navigate those emotions and critically think about their deployment. What reception trends do we note? What responses are outliers? Why do certain reviewers and certain publications skew a certain way? What are potential political motivations behind certain responses? How do these publications influence their audiences at the time and how do we read them now? These questions and more hinge on and influence affective responses, and archiving them opens up new avenues for considering individual subjective responses and public feelings toward certain authors.\n\nOne of the most interesting and difficult aspects of this project is describing and concretely defining these emotions in sentiment analysis. While annotating the documents, the Foreign Literatures in America (FLA) team had to come up with questions to succinctly evaluate the article writers' opinions, questions phrased so that they would yield uniform responses from a variety of readers. Turning subjective response into objectively categorized data is obviously a difficult undertaking, and it has required much fine-tuning and testing. However, one of the potential outcomes to this rigorous categorization and testing is that, given enough data collection over time, computers can pick up on repeated patterns and analyze sentiment. This idea of training a machine to pick up on subjective, even emotional, cues has vast potential, and I look forward to participating in this process.\n\n<em>Katherine Stanutz is a second year PhD student in English at the University of Maryland. She is an Executive Editor at the Foreign Literatures in America project.</em>",

    "wp post content": "Dear MITH Community,\n\nAs another academic year begins, I have the happy opportunity of welcoming you all back to MITH for what promises to be another exciting, event-laden year. While I’m at it, I’ll review some of the highlights from last year and provide a few coming attractions. Don’t worry if this email seems long: you have a whole year to read it before I send out the next one!\n\n<strong>Events and Conferences</strong>\nNotable MITH events from last year included an October visit to campus from acclaimed science fiction author and futurist Bruce Sterling, one of the founders of the cyberpunk movement; a January advanced seminar in TEI encoding for manuscripts sponsored by the Brown University Women Writers Project and supported by NEH; and a May invitational symposium on “<a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/research/computer-forensics-born-digital-content/\" target=\"_blank\">Computer Forensics and Born-Digital Content in Cultural Heritage Collections</a>,” attended by experts from the cultural heritage sector and computer and information science, as well as practitioners in government, industry, and defense, which was funded by the Mellon Foundation. Finally, in July, MITH co-hosted in London a very successful international summit of digital humanities centers and funders, supported by NEH.\n\nThis year we look forward to an October visit from Alan Liu, one of the foremost theorists of digital humanities and new media; a November MITH-hosted Rosenzweig Forum featuring renowned digital archivist Jason Scott, and a screening of his new film “Get Lamp: The Text Adventure Documentary”; a January advanced seminar in TEI encoding, sponsored by NEH; a January workshop on professionalization in digital humanities centers, sponsored by NEH; a February workshop on developing Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for the digital humanities, sponsored by NEH; an April lecture by Richard Grusin, Director of the Center for 21st Century Studies (U Wisconsin-Milwaukee); a public symposium on the documentation and preservation of dance, co-hosted with the Kennedy Center, probably in April; and a June conference at the University of Toronto between centerNet (an international network of digital humanities centers) and CHCI (Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes) that we’ll be co-organizing.\n\n<strong>Grants</strong>\nMITH continues to be on a roll! During the past year we’ve worked on 11 significant grants, recently won two others, and are waiting to hear about a few more very exciting projects. Among these are projects funded by the Library of Congress, NEH, IMLS, and Mellon Foundation. Our projects continue to run a wide gamut: from computer forensics to the preservation of virtual worlds, performing arts, and born-digital material; to the building of digital tools; to the creation of multimodal editions; to the building of international community and cyberinfrastructure in digital humanities. Three new projects are worth special mention in this regard: (1) our collaboration with the Smithsonian and Microsoft on emerging interfaces for museums and libraries; (2) our work with the Library of Congress on the digitization and preservation of the Danny Kaye and Sylvia Fine Collection; and (3) our collaboration with the Kennedy Center, the New York Public Library, and Ohio State University on the documentation and preservation of dance. Each of these projects highlights our increasing focus on Public Humanities, the ways in which the digital humanities can address audiences beyond the academy. Other recent project partners include the Folger Shakespeare Library, the British Library, the Bodleian Library, the Huntington Library the Harry Ransom Center, Emory University, Stanford University, the University of Illinois, the Rochester Institute of Technology, the Walters Art Gallery, and Linden Lab, the creators of Second Life. We are currently in discussions with Google about collaboration in an upcoming project that we hope to be able to announce by October.\n\n<strong>Fellows</strong>\nContinuing for a second year as a MITH Faculty Fellow is Frank Hildy, Professor of Theatre and Director of Shakespeare’s Globe (USA) Research Archive. Frank works as a theatre consultant for historic theatre preservation and reconstruction and is a member of the Architecture Research Group for Shakespeare’s Globe in London. As co-author with Oscar G. Brockett of The History of Theatre, a work generally known as the “bible of theatre history,” Frank is read world-wide by those interested in theatre architecture. He has been working with us on a prototype for a comprehensive global Digital Archive of Existing Historic Theatres, a collaboratively edited, peer-reviewed, online database of existing historic theatre buildings from the Greeks to the Romantics, covering all the still extant buildings from the Minoan “theatrical area” of c. 2000 BCE at Phaistos on the island of Crete, to the castle theatre of 1797 at Litomysl in Slovakia. A key component of this online database is the Collaborative, Ajax-Based, Modeling Platform (CAMP) being developed separately at MITH with funding from a NEH Level 2 Digital Humanities Startup Grant.\n\nJoining Frank this year as a MITH Faculty Fellow is Leigh Smiley, Associate Professor in the School of Theatre, Dance and Performance Studies, where she also serves as Director of the MFA in Performance. Leigh is an internationally known theatre artist, professional voice, dialect and acting coach, performer and director. She has just finished directing text and voice for Shakespeare &amp; Company in Lenox Massachusetts this summer and is Director of Dialects for Ford’s Theatre’s Christmas Carol and Carpetbagger’s Children in the 2010-2011 Season. Her professional engagements have included Dialect/Text and Voice direction with The Shakespeare Theatre, Folger Shakespeare Library Theatre, Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and Arena Stage. She will be working with us to create The Visual Accent/Dialect Archive (VADA), which will enable performers for the first time to research online authentic resources for hearing and seeing the gestural aspects of accent and dialect.\n\nOur Winnemore Dissertation Fellow last Spring was Mirona Magearu, a student in the Comparative Literature Program of the Department of English, who is working on an ambitious and promising dissertation: “Comparative Textual Performances in Digital Poetry: Local Voices and Global Visions.\"\n\n<strong>Staffing</strong>\nLast year, we made two stellar additions to MITH’s staff: Dave Lester, who joined us as Assistant Director, moving across town from George Mason University’s Center for History and New Media, where he was legendary for his creativity, as well as his technical and organizational skills, and Elizabeth Kvernen, who joined us after completing her MFA at the University of Baltimore in Integrated Design, with special expertise in Arabic calligraphy. Adding further luster to our ranks is Dr. Tanya Clement, Associate Director of the Digital Cultures and Creativity Program, who has been appointed a MITH Research Associate. I’m delighted also to mention two much-deserved promotions: Doug Reside from Assistant to Associate Director and Chris Grogan from Business Coordinator to Business Manager. Joining Chris in our Business Office as of November 1 will be Meei-Ching Ma as Business Services Specialist. Two graduate student Program Associates who joined us in the middle of last year, Ketan Patil (iSchool) and Alex Quinn (Computer Science/HCIL), will be working with us again this year alongside of long-time Program Associates Rachel Donahue (iSchool) and Helen DeVinney (English). We were fortunate, also, this past year to have three terrific iSchool grad student interns: Diana Aram (U Maryland), Isabela Carvalho (U Michigan) and Walker Sampson (U Texas), supported by a three-year grant from the IMLS that is also supporting the internship this fall of James Neal (U Maryland). Charlie Pinnix, an undergraduate Art major, interned with us during the summer, and Jon Gilmour an undergraduate English major, will be interning with us in the Fall. We also greatly benefitted last year from the help of two undergraduate business majors, Becca Hale and Kristin Cesario; Tin Tin Nguyen, a computer science major, will continue to add his technical expertise to our staff this year. Finally, we bid a fond farewell this summer to Greg Lord, MITH’s longtime designer extraordinaire, who has taken a position as Lead Designer and Software Engineer for the Digital Humanities Initiative at Hamilton College.\n\n<strong>Digital Cultures and Creativity</strong>\nThis past year saw the launch of the Digital Cultures and Creativity program, MITH’s first foray into the undergraduate curriculum, in partnership with the Department of Computer Science and the iSchool. DCC is an interdisciplinary living and learning program for first- and second-year students who will explore new media technologies through activities as varied as digital music and video production, digital art, creative electronic writing, virtual worlds, software development and entrepreneurship, and developing online communities. Directed by MITH’s Associate Director, Matt Kirschenbaum, with MITH Research Associate Tanya Clement as Associate Director, DCC’s first students are now in the process of arriving on campus. We are all looking forward to working with them over the course of the new academic year!\n\n<strong>Digital Dialogues</strong>\nThere is, as I hope you’ve seen, much to be excited about in the coming year, including another slate of Digital Dialogues on Tuesdays from 12:30 – 1:45, beginning on September 14, with a presentation by Zeynep Tufekci (UMBC) and Nathan Jurgenson (U Maryland) on “The iPad: The “Jesus Tablet” and the Resurrection of Consumer Society.” This year’s Digital Dialogues will mix our traditional format with specialized workshops.\n\nLast year’s Digital Dialogues frequently had standing room only crowds and we believe that this year’s program is every bit as compelling. Stay tuned for the announcement of the full Fall schedule!\n\n<strong>Finally</strong>\nFinally, I am delighted to say that our campus digital humanities community has been substantially enriched by the recent College of Arts and Humanities cluster hire in the field. We are extremely fortunate to have Hasan Elahi (Art), Jason Farman (American Studies), and Tara Rodgers (Women’s Studies) joining us this year.\n\nYou’ll have the opportunity to meet them all at MITH. We’re looking forward to seeing many of you during the coming year!\n\nBest,\nNeil",

In his time at MITH, Dave has supervised and completely transformed MITH’s operations, imaginatively programmed our Digital Dialogues series, revamped our communications strategy, run a splendid NEH-sponsored workshop on APIs, and inspired us all with his “less ya[fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=\"yes\" overflow=\"visible\"][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=\"1_1\" background_position=\"left top\" background_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" border_color=\"\" border_style=\"solid\" spacing=\"yes\" background_image=\"\" background_repeat=\"no-repeat\" padding=\"\" margin_top=\"0px\" margin_bottom=\"0px\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_direction=\"left\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" center_content=\"no\" min_height=\"none\"][c]k, more hack,” can-do spirit. It would be hard to imagine a more creative, savvy, and enlivening colleague. And he brings in donut holes almost every Monday morning, to boot!\n\nWe are nonetheless delighted to congratulate Dave on receiving a fellowship from Berkeley’s iSchool to pursue a Master’s degree in Information Management. Although it may seem to be the worst of times for us to have to bid Dave farewell, there is more to this story.\n\nWe are as just as delighted to announce that when Dave steps down as Assistant Director of MITH in August, he will also be stepping up to assume the new position of Creative Lead at MITH, thereby establishing “MITH West” in the Bay Area.  It is thus the best of times again. While we’ll miss Dave’s daily presence, we’re excited about continuing to work with him for what we hope will be long into the future.\n\nOur heartiest congratulations to Dave![/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]",

More detail is available here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.newsdesk.umd.edu/culture/release.cfm?ArticleID=1620\r\n\r\nThe nearly $120,000 NEH grant will provide initial funds for one year to create a technical proof of concept \"working model\" for the project by digitizing all 32 pre-1641 versions of Hamlet held by the participating libraries. \"The JISC/NEH initiative gave us the opportunity and the incentive to attempt a truly international, collaborative, digital project,\" says Folger Project Director RICHARD KUHTA. \"The guidelines challenged us to think collectively about what was possible, and to realize a shared ambition. It was exactly the prompt we needed to launch a conversation that transformed geographically distant collections into partner institutions.\" NEIL FRAISTAT adds, \"We are proud to have as partners such institutions as the Folger Shakespeare Library, the Huntington Library, the British Library, and the Bodleian Library of Oxford University. This grant caps what has been an extraordinary year for MITH, in which it has received five major grants, covering the gamut from Shakespeare's Quartos to the preservation of Virtual Worlds.\"\r\n\r\nIn this Digital Dialogue, we will introduce the project to the university community, solicit initial feedback, and discuss ways to involve interested constituents as our work progresses. The discussion will be led by NEIL FRAISTAT (Professor of English and Director, MITH), JIM KUHN (Head of Collection Information Services, Folger), RICHARD KHUTA (Librarian, Folger), and DOUG RESIDE (Assistant Director, MITH).\r\n\r\nNote: John Carlson's talk, originally scheduled for this day, has been cancelled.\r\n\r\nComing up @MITH 4/15: Kari Kraus (Information School and English), \"Rezzing Books: Codex Technologies in the Metaverse.\"\r\n\r\nView MITH's complete Digital Dialogues schedule here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_spring_2008.pdf\r\n\r\nAll talks free and open to the public!\r\n\r\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-8927).",

These types of services, which were once only locally provided, can now be distributed among institutions for a peer-sourced type of community support.  By investing in a shared networked solution, academic libraries can achieve efficiencies and market influence, that would be impossible at the scale of any one institution.  In order to realize the promise of networked macrosolutions, libraries must be able to externalize their service need and trust their peer counterparts to help provide services that were once traditionally a single source operation.\n\nA key factor for success is in directly engaging with faculty and academic officers to communicate a compelling strategy in which selective externalization of services can be win-win situation for the local institution as well as for the external partners. Traditional library functions improve the libraries' ability to fulfill a local contextual academic and research mission. However, creating new avenues for networked global scale shared services can be in the best interest of all parties. For some shared services, managing them at the largest scale offers savings both in terms of that particular service as well as in terms of capital re-investment in other more locally contextually dependent services. Externalizing functions is not new – but doing so in a highly networked environment, at global-scale is.  The <a href=\"http://www.hathitrust.org/\" target=\"_blank\">HathiTrust Digital Library</a> and the <a href=\"http://dp.la/\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Public Library of America</a> will be discussed as examples of macrosolutions and how they have the potential to change how libraries engage with scholars.\n\nThis talk will be held in the MITH Conference Room, in the basement of McKeldin Library.\n\nRachel Frick is the Director of the Digital Library Federation Program at the <a href=\"http://www.clir.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Council on Library and Information Resources</a> (CLIR/DLF). Previous to her work at CLIR, Rachel served the National Leadership Grants Program for Libraries as senior program officer at the <a href=\"http://www.imls.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">Institute for Museum and Library Services</a> (IMLS). Ms. Frick's library experiences range from being the head of bibliographic access and digital services at the University of Richmond to a regional sales manager for the Faxon Company, with a variety of library positions in between. She holds an MSLS degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a BA in English literature from Guilford College.\n\nComing up @MITH 11/01: Trevor Muñoz (Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities), \"Learning on the Job: Data Curation by Humanists, Librarians, and the Public\"\n\n<em>A continuously updated schedule of talks is also available on the <a href=\"../podcast/\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Dialogues</a> webpage.</em>\n\n<em>Unable to attend the events in person?

The concept of \"digital curation\" encompasses both archiving and preservation but stresses a holistic lifecycle management approach to creating, selecting and maintaining digital objects and metadata. Several research projects have determined that curation awareness is strongest in the data-intense hard sciences such as physics and engineering but is gaining foothold in the humanities disciplines and information repositories. This presentation will explore the broad principles of digital curation and examine its implementation through institutional case studies of libraries and archives. Finally, the presentation will open up some questions about the challenges of developing and implementing local digital curation policies.\r\r\n\r\r\nSince July 2006, KATE MURRAY is the Audiovisual Archivist at University of Maryland College Park Libraries and the chair of the libraries Digital Curation Policy subgroup. She has been involved with creating and maintaining digital dynamic media collections since 2001, serving first as the Digital Project Coordinator at University of Cape Town, South Africa, and later as the Audio and Visual Media Conservator at Emory University. She is the acting Secretary Treasurer of the American Institute for Conservation's Electronic Materials Group. Kate received her MLS from University of Cape Town in 2002.\r\r\n\r\r\nComing up @MITH, April 17: MITH Fellows Angel David Nieves (Architecture), \"The Politics of Race and 'Serious Gaming' in the Digital Humanities: SOWETO '76 and Post-Apartheid Archives in the 'New' South Africa,\" and Merle Collins (English and Comparative Literature), \"Africa to the Caribbean: Saraka and Nation.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-8927).",

Widespread public internet access played a key role in the transgender movement’s growing visibility at the national level during the 1990s. Access to the Internet mitigated many issues that had limited other organizing efforts, like geographic limitations and the sometimes-lengthy publication arc of print media. From the earliest days of </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FidoNet\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Fidonet</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, trans individuals have made spaces for discussion and resource-sharing online. Some of these spaces were hosted on </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Usenet</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, a decentralized, worldwide discussion system founded in 1980 and organized around topic-specific newsgroups. Usenet, as a communications network, is an influential predecessor to modern social media platforms and the origin point for now-common bits of contemporary Internet vocabulary like “spam.” </span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Amongst its many newsgroups was a small collection of important transgender-related forums, the five most active being alt.transgendered, soc.support.transgendered, alt.support.srs, alt.support.crossdressing, and alt.fashion.crossdressing. As the anonymous poster in the opening quote notes, these spaces offered folks the opportunity to communicate and find support, without falling into “maladaptive” coping strategies. Discussions were active and sometimes highly contentious, as posters—some of them major figures in transgender political activism at the time—discussed and debated key issues of the day in transgender politics. </span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">These newsgroups are at the center of my project as a </span><a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/community/fellowships/winnemore-fellows/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Winnemore Digital Dissertation Fellow</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> for this year. As a Fellow, I’ll be building a public archive of posts from these five groups using the </span><a href=\"http://benschmidt.org/projects/bookworm-info/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bookworm API</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and data from the Internet Archive’s </span><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/usenethistorical\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Usenet Historical Collection</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. This archive will form a key part of my work, a case study focused on how posters use the term “cisgender” in their discussions. These groups are one of the few archival locations where participants regularly used the term, and several origin narratives point to different newsgroups as being the where it was first used. For my project, however, I’m not interested in origins so much as the specific contexts it was used in and how posters connected this use to their broader understandings of “transgender community.” This follows the focus of my larger dissertation, which explores the affective and structural meanings assigned to “community” in English-language transgender discourse online. </span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Beyond my own project, though, I’ll also be thinking and writing about the mechanics of Usenet-related research in general. Archival Usenet research can face </span><a href=\"https://medium.com/message/never-trust-a-corporation-to-do-a-librarys-job-f58db4673351#.4oj9n1ccu\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">significant</span></a> <a href=\"http://motherboard.vice.com/en_uk/read/google-a-search-company-has-made-its-internet-archive-impossible-to-search\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">barriers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and raises important ethical questions about the afterlife of data. Over the coming year, I’ll be writing and posting about my process here on the MITH blog, </span><a href=\"http://averydame.net/?page_id=436\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">my own blog</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, and (occasionally) </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/adame\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">on Twitter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. Some of these posts will be about the technical and ethical challenges of the project, offering a window into I’m thinking through them. I’ll also be sharing some of my early findings and other interesting things I encounter in the archive during my research.</span>\n\n\n\n&nbsp;",

    "wp post content": "<p dir=\"ltr\">In the past few months, MITH has been developing software for a project related to the <a href=\"http://www.whitmanarchive.org\">Walt Whitman Archive</a>. The <i>Walt Whitman Archive</i> is an electronic research and teaching tool that sets out to make Whitman's vast work, for the first time, easily and conveniently accessible to scholars, students, and general readers. Working in collaboration with the <a href=\"http://www.utexas.edu/cola/depts/english/\">University of Texas at Austin</a>, as well as the <a href=\"http://cdrh.unl.edu/\">Center for Digital Research in the Humanities</a> at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, the project team is focusing on Walt Whitman’s annotations and commentary about history, science, theology, and art being discussed during his time. These annotations survived in many forms, either as marginalia and underlinings on books, or as collages of newspaper clippings, or as separate handwritten notes. Studying this material can further our understanding of the poet’s self-education and his compositional methods.</p>\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.5em\">The documents containing Whitman’s annotations have been transcribed and encoded by the project team according to the </span><a style=\"line-height: 1.5em\" href=\"http://www.tei-c.org\">Text Encoding Initiative</a><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em\"> (TEI) standard, which allows scholars to precisely describe complex texts with paste-downs, doodles, mixed printed and handwritten content, etc. In the case of Whitman’s marginalia, it has also been possible to encode the editors’ understanding of what exactly the poet highlighted, annotated and commented on.</span>\n\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.5em\">MITH is now building a digital publication around these precisely encoded data. To do so, we are adapting the tools developed for our own </span><a style=\"line-height: 1.5em\" href=\"http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/\">Shelley-Godwin Archive</a><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em\">.  The Shelley-Godwin Archive provides the digitized manuscripts of Percy Bysshe Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, William Godwin, and Mary Wollstonecraft, bringing together online for the first time ever the widely dispersed handwritten legacy of this uniquely gifted family of writers. The archive makes use of Linked Open Data principles and emerging standards such as the </span><a style=\"line-height: 1.5em\" href=\"http://www.openannotation.org/\">Open Annotation</a><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em\"> and the </span><a style=\"line-height: 1.5em\" href=\"http://www.shared-canvas.org/\">Shared Canvas</a><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em\"> data models in order to open the contents of the archive to widespread use and reuse. The Linked Open Data drive our rendering engines and is generated directly from the TEI files. By adapting our Shelley-Godwin tools for Whitman, we found that Open Annotation was particularly suited for modeling Whitman’s own annotations, as the data model offered a basic and open system to represent generic annotation acts (for example by relating a piece of Whitman’s commentary to the specific portion of text that it annotates).</span>\n\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.5em\">The final digital publication will allow users to read semi-diplomatic transcriptions of the texts alongside facsimile images, as well as visually distinguish regions of text annotated by Whitman. We are also building a search system that indexes the text according to several categories, so that users may search on text annotated by Whitman as opposed to text written by the author, etc.</span>\n\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.5em\">We are busy finalizing this work - watch our blog for a project launch announcements in a few weeks. Meanwhile, feel free to write to </span><a style=\"line-height: 1.5em\" href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/people/person/raffaele-viglianti/\">Raffaele Viglianti</a><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em\"> if you have any questions.</span>\n\n&nbsp;",

VHL was housed in Italian Studies at Brown University; we have collaborated with scholars at Brown, and throughout North America and Europe. First, we employed humanities scholars previously unfamiliar with semantic text encoding. The scholars were tasked with studying two information-rich primary sources -- by encoding them using idiosyncratic encoding structures. This required training and various types of support, and was complicated by the scholars' disparate geographical locations. We also made contact with a group in Mexico that is studying one of our texts, Giovanni Boccaccio's _Expositions on the Divine Comedy_. We've set up a discussion forum for them to do their work using our encoded text. Finally, we collaborated amongst ourselves across three continents on writing papers, designing the VHL interface, and further textual analysis.\r\r\n\r\r\nAt MITH, I will talk about the results of these different types of collaboration. I will relate what worked well (a strategic blend of facetime and online communication) and what could have worked better (training humanists in the fundamentals of humanities computing). I will stress and illustrate the importance that collaboration has begun to play in the humanities, and propose to introduce collaboration more substantively into humanities research, arguing for its benefits over our usual solitary work.\r\r\n\r\r\nVIKA ZAFRIN is a PhD candidate in Special Studies (Humanities Computing) at Brown University, expecting graduation next spring.

Ideally, faculty MITH fellows will be relieved of teaching responsibilities during the fellowship period (half-time if they choose a year-long residence in MITH, full-time if they opt for a semester of residence). Prospective fellows are encouraged to apply to their units, to their Deans, or other sources to support course buy outs. Librarians will be relieved of the equivalent of half-time yearly teaching duties and should seek support from the Dean of Libraries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFellowships will be offered to professors and/or librarians developing their research, teaching, creative performances, and information studies work in ways that implement and productively exploit electronic resources, with preference given to those who have worked especially to integrate their scholarly or performance discoveries and methods into their pedagogy, mentoring, and library practices. Besides working on their proposed project, fellows are expected to present their work in MITH's Digital Dialogue series and to become active members in the MITH community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThose interested in applying for a MITH fellowship should contact Neil Fraistat, Director of MITH (fraistat@umd.edu) in order to formulate a strategy for a successful MITH residency. Further information about the MITH Resident Fellowship, as well as an application, can be found at <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/community/fellowships/\">http://www.mith2.umd.edu/about/fellowsprogram.php</a>.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApplications are due by <strong>Friday, April 16</strong>.",

    "wp post content": "It's been an interesting couple of weeks at the Foreign Literatures in America project, as we've really begun to set sail as concerns both the Russian literary reception archive and the Modern British literary archive. Though the projects are large, and seem to increase further and further with excitement as we delve further into them, we have also found that many of our energies have been devoted to getting many small and technical details precisely in order. We've actually been working on such things for months, but the fine tuning is being able to show results.\n\nThere are three basic dimensions to our project so far as assembling these archives—in part, as resources in themselves; in equal part, to develop Natural Language Processing tools usable on further reception materials and other data—is concerned.\n\nThe first is the actual high quality scanning of reception materials. Nick Slaughter, one of the executive editors at FLA and the director of the Russian Authors Initiative, has developed a meticulously extensive guide detailing how to scan these materials at the University of Maryland. Collaboration with the undergraduate Gemstone team POLITIC (in particular, through team members Matthew Carr, Robert Cai, Adam Elrafei, Andrew Li, and Dan Yang), as part of their own research project quantitatively assessing the politicization of Russian literature in the US in relation to U.S. foreign policy, has begun to result in a rich fund of scans, while meanwhile Rebecca Borden and Jennifer Wellman, also executive editors of FLA, have been spearheading similar efforts as concerns American reception of the Polish-English author Joseph Conrad, especially as Conrad's women readers are concerned. One question that keeps coming up in all this is the efficiency of the process: we all are very committed to securing the highest possible quality scans for any number of reasons ranging from the curatorial to NLP; but this said, there are faster and slower ways of securing files, and we already have thousands of pages of very rare documents that are not of the highest quality. It is a question in my mind whether the scholarly community is better served simply by our posting what we already have on the FLA website, rather than going to great lengths to re-find data we already have and that scholars really need ASAP.\n\nThis raises the second technical dimension of our project: OCR, ocular character recognition software. We have been blown away by just how easy and accurate and unbelievably fast the ABBYY software we have purchased and are working with is—even on scans that are not of the highest quality. The OCRing of the several thousand pages we have of scans is simply zooming along—not least because Alex Winter, Soumya Yanamandra, and Kay Zhang on the Gemstone team have mastered the system in ways that will forever be beyond my skill set.\n\nThis finally leaves the third technical dimension of this phase of the project: namely, developing, or rather, fine-tuning annotation questions to ask of the data we are gathering, so as to make it possible to train computers to read for and answer the kind of questions that simply keyword searches alone cannot avail. Adrian Hamins-Puertolas, Alex Goniprow, Manpreet Khural, Nick Slaughter and I have been working very hard on these question: we're up to four revisions now, each tested in a kind of quadruple-blind independently between the four of us upon various articles to see if we can come up with consistent answers and hence a viable questionnaire. We are very close: out of 16, there remains one question on literary \"style\" and \"artistry\" that is giving us the most trouble. We've been having amazing fun sifting through these questions, pondering issues, some of them very technical, that I don't think any of us individually had foreseen. It is because of these small details that we have been meticulously attending to during the past several weeks, and actually months, that I expect we will reap enormous analytic rewards in the near future.\n\n<em>Peter Lancelot Mallios is a MITH Faculty Fellow. He directs the Foreign Literatures in America Project and is a professor in English at the University of Maryland.</em>",

Cazabon will discuss her project <em>Discard</em>, which consists of several discrete series of large-scale photographic prints featuring movie films discarded by public institutions (libraries, schools, archives). Harking back to the 19th century practice of postmortem photography, each print in this body of work serves as a memento mori to the recently obsolete medium of film. In its totality, <em>Discard</em> is a shadow archive, reflecting that which has been omitted from institutional archives and reflecting upon a process by which values are reversed: whereby something once valued becomes worthless and looses its viability as a cultural artifact. The project also underlines our current reliance on potentially unstable digital technologies to preserve the things we deem to be worth saving and asks what is lost when we don't save such physical artifacts (like film) but only transfer its image to digital media. Cazabon will also discuss the notion of the archive as it plays out in her other projects.\n\n\n\nThis talk will be held in 6137 McKeldin Library, Special Events.\n\n\n\nLynn Cazabon's work in photography, video and installation has been exhibited both nationally and internationally, in solo and group exhibitions at Schroeder Romero (NYC), Hallwalls Contemporary Arts Center (Buffalo, NY), The Creative Alliance (Baltimore), Anthology Film Archives (NYC), Galerie Vox (Montreal), Artists Space (NYC), The Mattress Factory (Pittsburgh, PA), Atlanta Contemporary Art Center (Atlanta), C. Grimaldis Gallery (Baltimore), Le Local (sponsored by Folie/Culture, Quebec, QC), PS122 (NYC), the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum (Ridgefield, CT), and at the Art Gallery at the University of Maryland (College Park, MD). She has received grants and residency fellowships from the Maryland State Arts Council, Pennsylvania Council on the Arts, Franklin Furnace Archives, The Camargo Foundation, Jentel Foundation, The MacDowell Colony, Fundacion Valparaiso, and Yaddo. Her work is featured in numerous exhibition catalogs and has been written about by noted photo historian Geoffrey Batchen in the book <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Each Wild Idea: Writing, Photography, History</span> (MIT Press, 2001). Cazabon is an Associate Professor of Art at University of Maryland, Baltimore County.\n\n\n\nA continuously updated schedule of talks is also available on the Digital Dialogues webpage.\n\n\n\nUnable to attend the events in person?\n\n\n\nArchived podcasts can be found on the MITH website, and you can follow our Digital Dialogues Twitter account @digdialog as well as the Twitter hashtag #mithdd to keep up with live tweets from our sessions.\n\n\n\nAll talks free and open to the public. Attendees are welcome to bring their own lunches.",

The NEH, through its Digital Humanities Initiative (DHI), has taken a leadership position in bringing these new technologies to bear. In 2006, the American Council of Learned Societies released Our Cultural Commonwealth, which is their now-famous report on cyberinfrastructure for the humanities. This report states that: \"The emergence of the Internet has transformed the practice of the humanities and social sciences--more slowly than some may have hoped, but more profoundly than others may have expected. Digital cultural heritage resources are a fundamental dataset for the humanities: these resources, combined with computer networks and software tools, now shape the way that scholars discover and make sense of the human record, while also shaping the way their findings are communicated to students, colleagues, and the general public.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n[http://www.acls.org/cyberinfrastructure/OurCulturalCommonwealth.pdf, from Executive Summary]\r\r\n\r\r\nThe NEH is encouraging the field to build the basic infrastructure--what we call \"cyberinfrastructure\"--needed for humanities scholarship. This includes funding the creation of tools, databases, and other technology products used for humanities research, education, public programming, and preservation. It also includes \"human infrastructure\"--that is, funding digital humanities centers and other organizations which bring together humanities scholars with computer scientists, engineers, librarians, and others towards the goal of excellent scholarship.\r\r\n\r\r\nBRETT BOBLEY will provide an overview of the NEH's DHI program including information about our future directions. Bobley serves as the Chief Information Officer for the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and is also the Director of the agency's Digital Humanities Initiative (DHI). Under DHI, he has put in place new grant programs aimed at supporting innovative humanities projects that utilize or study the impact of digital technology. Bobley has a master's degree in computer science from the Johns Hopkins University and a bachelor's degree in philosophy from the University of Chicago.\r\r\n\r\r\nComing up @MITH 10/23, Martha Nell Smith (English): \"Agora.Techno.Phobia.Philia: Gender (and other messy matters), Knowledge Building, and Digital Media\"\r\r\n\r\r\nView MITH's complete Fall Speakers Schedule <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100615144449/http://www.mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_fall_2007.pdf\">here.</a>\r\r\n\r\r\nAll talks free and open to the public!\r\r\n\r\r\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-8927)",

    "wp post content": "As Sayan Bhattacharyya and I have <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/topic-modeling-in-the-humanities-an-overview/\" target=\"_blank\">discussed</a> in <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/reflections-on-scale-and-topic-modeling/\" target=\"_blank\">several</a> <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/digging-into-data-with-topic-models/\" target=\"_blank\">posts</a> over the summer, the technique of unsupervised “topic modeling” or Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) has emerged in the humanities as one way to engage a text in “distant reading”. The appeal of the technique lies chiefly in the minimal assumptions it makes about the structure of meaning in a body of texts. However, this strength can also be a liability when the researcher brings specific research questions to a corpus. Classic topic modeling offers few levers of control by which a researcher can influence the outcome of the exercise.\n\nHow to remedy this? Digital Humanities practitioners are not typically in the business of implementing topic models. Rather, the Digital Humanities community has received LDA from the Natural Language Processing community, who in turn built it from basic research in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability\" target=\"_blank\">Bayesian methods</a>. As humanists consider the programmatic infrastructure requisite to launching innovations in topic modeling, the NLP community is addressing a diversifying portfolio of questions in their field by muting basic LDA. In this post, I present three key questions for practitioners to ask in tentatively approaching new topic modeling techniques developed in the Natural Language Processing community:\n<ol>\n\t<li>What kind of questions does the model address?</li>\n\t<li>What new information does the model include to address these questions?</li>\n\t<li>How is the structure of the model adapted so that it can take advantage of the new information to answer the questions?</li>\n</ol>\nI illustrate the application of these questions to Wang and McCallum's paper on <a href=\"http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.152.2460\" target=\"_blank\">Topics over Time</a>. As in many topic modeling papers, much light can be shed simply from reading the introduction.\n\nWhat kind of questions does the model address?\n\nIn the opening section of their paper, Wang and McCallum explain that their approach is motivated by unexploited temporal information. In their more technical language, “the large data sets to which these topic models are applied do not have static co-occurrence patterns; the data are often collected over time, and generally patterns present in the early part of the collection are not in effect later.” We might like to see the Mexican-American War and World War I, for example, emerge as distinct topics in a historical analysis of U.S. State-of-the-Union addresses. The Topics over Time technique is designed to encourage topics to “rise and fall in prominence” as a function of time (1).\n\nWhat new information does the model include?\n\nAs I pointed out in my <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/topic-modeling-in-the-humanities-an-overview/\" target=\"_blank\">previous post</a>, topical characterization of a time window is achievable using classic LDA. Simply average a topic's prominence over each document inside the window. However, the topics thus distributed over time have already, at that point, conflated aspects of things like wars waged decades apart. Thus, for example, a topic including airplanes as a prominent word might be well represented in 1893. This is fine if we’re looking for transhistorical themes, but not if we’d rather find historical trends in the use of language. Topics over Time uses the date-stamp associated with each document, taking this as input data alongside information about the co-occurrence of words.\n\nHow is the structure of the model adapted?\n\nTopics over Time uses date-stamps to encourage topics to cluster around a point in time. As the inferential machinery behind the model develops topics, it also estimates where the central point in time lies for each topic and how far the topic tends to disperse around that point. In Wang and McCallum's language, 'TOT [Topics over Time] parameterizes a continuous distribution over time associated with each topic, and topics are responsible for generating both observed timestamps as well as words. Parameter estimation is thus driven to discover topics that simultaneously capture word co-occurrences and locality of those patterns in time’(Section 1). This leads to more topics that reveal historically specific themes.\n\nTopics over Time is one of a number of topic model adaptations that hold promise for the digital humanities. <a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.62.2783&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Dynamic Topic Modeling</a> allows topics to evolve from year to year, capturing the intuition that scientific fields, for example, endure despite changing terminology. Using <a href=\"http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/papers/BleiMcAuliffe2007.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Supervised LDA</a> (SLDA), another innovation, a modeler can encourage topics to form so that the proportions of topics making up a document are effective predictors of some target variable. This allows the modeler to exert influence on the kind of structure topic modeling explicates. Finally, Dirichlet Forests allow the modeler to engender affinities or aversions between words based on prior knowledge of the content domain.\n\nFor all of these techniques, an additional key question is where to find the code to implement them. Code implementing Dirichlet Forest Priors can be found <a href=\"http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~andrzeje/research/df_lda.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. An implementation of SLDA can be found <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20120825213639/http://www.cs.princeton.edu:80/~chongw/slda/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. Another option is always to contact the researchers on a paper and ask them if their code is sharable, or to consult your local topic modeling expert (if you’re fortunate enough to have one!).",

Developed by an interdisciplinary, intergenerational research team at the University of Maryland, the collection currently includes contemporary and historic children's books in 48 languages from 60 countries. The interface is available in sixteen languages. Although originally developed for children from ages 3-13, the research team has been working on extending the ICDL for use by other audiences and available on other platforms. Through partnerships with the Universities of Florida, Connecticut, and Minnesota, as well as the Boston Public Library, four special collections of historic children's materials, which may be of particular interest to humanities scholars, are now available.\n\nThe members of the technology team have created a new prototype that explores how the simplicity of the ICDL interface can be extended to a broader set of content for a wider audience. This new interface targets content for adults and adult users. Working with the Boston Public Library, this first effort demonstrates its application to 1,500 books from John Adams' collection in the Open Content Alliance (OCA). The Team also has built a new prototype that extends the reach of the ICDL to mobile phones. An iPhone application that offers four books in multiple languages using a special \"ClearText\" technology that makes the picture books readable even on these small screens, will be available soon. Members of the ICDL research team will describe the new special collections, demonstrate the new technologies, and discuss the project's goal of using technology to deliver the widest range of books to the widest range of audiences.\n\nComing up @MITH 11/25: Clifford Lynch -- postponed until spring semester due to Thanksgiving holiday.\n\nComing up @MITH 12/2: Elizabeth Bearden (English), \"Renaissance Moving Pictures: From Sidney's Funeral Materials to Collaborative, Multimedia Nachleben\"\n\nAll talks free and open to the public!\n\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-8927).",

From recognizing faces to understanding music to reading text, the pace at which we experience media impacts how we understand it. The speed with which we compute determines how we interpret our computation, from simply pushing buttons to get a particular result to creating works of art. How can we elevate the computer to be a participant in our own artistic and humanistic endeavors?\n\nJAMES SMITH is a Software Architect at MITH. James holds a M.A. in English and an undergraduate degree in Mathematics and Physics from Texas A&amp;M University. Before joining MITH, he was the Digital Humanities Lead Developer for the Digital Humanities Program in the Texas A&amp;M University College of Liberal Arts where he was responsible for building and deploying infrastructure to support the digital humanities. As part of his professional work at Texas A&amp;M, James developed a digital humanities platform that is serving as a foundational element in a course he will be teaching at the Digital Humanities Summer Institute (DHSI) 2011 on “Data Discovery, Management, and Presentation.\n\nA continuously updated schedule of talks is also available on the <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/podcast/\"><strong>Digital Dialogues webpage</strong></a>.\n\nUnable to attend the events in person?

Once the dream of Silicon Valley tech startups, the democratization of web publishing has brought huge challenges to the mega-corporations that run today's social media platforms, as they struggle to prevent the viral spread of online hate, violence and abuse.\n\n\n\nKey to these moderation systems are large numbers of human moderators, who interpret community guidelines, and sometimes clandestine content rules, in order to decide what content will remain online.

    "wp post content": "A few weeks ago I began putting together MITH’s new digital curation workstation. The primary reason for the workstation was to build a testbed for the <a href=\"http://www.bitcurator.net/\">BitCurator environment</a>, an open source suite of digital forensics (DF) tools that have been repurposed for the curation of born-digital materials. While there are commercial DF workstations available on the market (for example, see <a href=\"http://www.digitalintelligence.com/products/fred/\">Digital Intelligence’s FRED system</a>), their cost can be prohibitive, especially compared to the ever-diminishing cost of desktop workstations.\n\nWhat I wanted to come up with was a system under $1000 that would allow access to as many forms of digital media as possible. After researching the different options I ultimately chose a Windows 7 64-bit workstation with an i7 Intel processor, 24GB of RAM, and a 2TB SATA hard drive. When building a digital curation workstation running BitCurator, perhaps the most critical component is the system RAM. This is because BitCurator is designed to run in a virtual machine on a host operating system (hosts can be Windows, OSX, or Linux). As a general rule, the more RAM you have to dedicate to a virtual machine, the better performance you can expect. However, these specs reflect an optimal configuration; if you want to repurpose an existing workstation instead of buying a new one, you can run the BitCurator environment on any PC with a 64-bit capable CPU (most Intel and AMD CPUs have been able to run 64-bit operating systems for the last few generations), 2GB of RAM, and a 250GB SATA hard drive.\n\nChoosing the system components was just the first step in building our digital curation workstation, however. The primary challenge most digital archivists face is getting physical access to their media. To address this, the MITH digital curation workstation includes an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_card_reader\">“All-in-One” memory card reader</a> which allows access to everything from Sony Memory Sticks to micro SD cards. For an optical drive, you want a drive that can read as many formats as possible, so a drive that can read Blu-ray disks and is backwards compatible with older DVDs and CD-ROMs is ideal (you’ll want to check and make sure your drive can effectively read burned media as well). Zip disks, though comparatively short-lived, are still common enough that a born-digital curation workstation would be incomplete without a Zip drive. USB Zip drives are still available new from the manufacturer, and are also easily found on auction sites such as eBay.\n\nPerhaps the media types that present the biggest challenge are 3.5” and 5.25” floppy disks. For 3.5” floppy disks I recommend a USB 3.5” floppy disk drive because 1) they are still readily available, and 2) because USB devices integrate into the BitCurator environment more easily than those connected to a floppy disk controller on the motherboard. For the 5.25” drive we used the <a href=\"http://www.deviceside.com/fc5025.html\">FC5025 device by Device Side</a>, a USB peice of hardware that, when coupled with a 5.25” drive, allows a Windows, Mac or Linux PC to read a wide variety of 5.25” floppy disk formats, including Apple DOS 3.2 and 3.3, MS DOS, Commodore 1541, and Atari 810--just to name a few (see the above link for a full listing). For more on accessing 3.5” and 5.25” floppy disks, I recommend an article by Doug Reside (MITH alum and digital curator at the NY Public Library) titled: <a href=\"http://www.nypl.org/blog/2012/07/23/digital-archaeology-recovering-your-digital-history\">“Digital Archaeology: Recovering your Digital History”.</a> Doug’s article is particularly helpful because not only does he outline the various media types and their required drives, but he also tells you where you can find the drives themselves, many of which are no longer manufactured.\n\nOnce complete, we didn’t have long to wait before using our new digital curation workstation. Travis Brown, one of the directors here at MITH, came to me with a stack of 5.25” floppy disks containing some of Neil Fraistat’s early work on Percy Shelley’s manuscripts. Back in the early 90s, Neil had transcribed the Prometheus Unbound portions of Percy Shelley’s notebooks (ms Shelley e.1, e.2, e.3), painstakingly recreating in WordPerfect 4.2 each of Shelley’s hand-marked notations. For example, lines that were struck through in the manuscript were likewise struck through in the WordPerfect documents, along with word changes and emendations. If we could recover Neil’s early digital transcriptions, they could serve as a foundation for the work being done on the <a href=\"http://www.shelleygodwinarchive.org/\">Shelley-Godwin Archive</a>, another project here at MITH. Using the FC5025, we were able to access the disks and copy the file contents onto the workstation’s hard drive. We then used the current version of WordPerfect to convert the transcriptions into a modern document format. The time saved by recovering Neil’s original transcriptions goes beyond just that needed to retype the original documents; it includes the careful validation work done by Neil’s collaborators at the Bodleian Library. Taken together, their work represents a significant example of early digital humanities work, work that is now available to us because of the tools described above. From here the electronic transcriptions will be used to form a foundation for further TEI encoding and be an important part of of the Shelley-Godwin Archive.\n\nThis is just one example of how we here at MITH anticipate being able to use our new digital curation workstation, and, we think, makes a pretty compelling case for similar workstations being an essential part of any digital humanities center.\n\n<em>Porter Olsen is a Ph.D. candidate in the University of Maryland Department of English and a Graduate Research Assistant with the BitCurator project at MITH.</em>",

This is her first award for film.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe project was filmed with the MITH Canon GL1 digital camera in 2003 and 2004, but the 2004 digital cassettes were stolen in Bolivia after three weeks of filming. Despite this setback, she then bought her own Canon GL2 to return to the labyrinth of mine tunnels to film again in 2005. Harrison, as a MITH fellow, received training in film technique from MITH fellow April Householder and from MITH Advisory Board member Irvin Kershner.

However, the ubiquity of easy mapping interfaces and handheld devices is now bringing GIS to the attention of researchers beyond science, architecture, and engineering. The Scholars' Lab at the University of Virginia Library is developing a new technical infrastructure and discovery mechanism to aggregate and visually layer terabytes of its own geospatial data with open-access information on the Web.  But can we design a system to meet the special interpretive requirements of the humanities?  How can we serve disciplines for which subjectivity inflects results, and ambiguous or contradictory evidence necessarily shapes every map?\n\n\n\nBETHANY NOWVISKIE is Director of Digital Research &amp; Scholarship at the University of Virginia Library.

Why should we worry? These questions, among others, are asked by SIVA VAIDHYANATHAN, Professor of Media Studies at the University of Virginia, in his recently published tome <em>The Googlization of Everything -- and Why We Should Worry</em>. Using Google Street View as the prime example and case study, Dr. Vaidhyanathan explores the ways and means through which Google engineers and justifies its systems of surveillance around the world. Despite proclaiming cultural sensitivity, Google engages in a \"one-size-fits-all\" model of privacy -- and the defaults are always set to Google's advantage. On Tuesday, May 3rd, at 12:30, Dr. Vaidhyanathan will deliver a talk as part of the Digital Dialogue series at the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH). In addition to discussing his book, Dr. Vaidhyanathan will introduce the notion of \"infrastructural imperialism\" to describe how Google goes about managing its relations with users and states around the world.\n\n\n\nThe talk will be held in the Special Events Room of McKeldin Library, followed by a book signing.\n\n\n\nSIVA VAIDHYANATHAN is a cultural historian and media scholar at the University of Virginia. He is the author of The Googlization of Everything -- and Why We Should Worry from the University of California Press, published in 2011.

It is now chiefly seen as the product of a relatively large coterie situated in Queen Anne Boleyn's court at an exciting time in English history (fictionalized grandly by the Tudors' miniseries ;), and quite prominently as the first sustained example of men and women writing together in the English tradition.  Even so, what we now find to be most unique and engaging about the document itself is difficult to access, in part because of academic skills and context necessary simply to read and understand it, but in larger part because the connection between prominent identifiable figures and their expressions in the manuscript -- which amount in the best cases to multi-voiced discussions and pontifications on matter important to the authors and scribes of the manuscript -- is difficult to sustain in any meaningful way using traditional methods.  This talk will represent the work of a largish group at UVic who have been working on an edition of the manuscript and, as part of this, have carried out an experimentation in tool mashing / visualization to allow a more coherent engagement of the connection between the people contributing to the manuscript and the nature of the their exchanges and, via this, to enable a significantly increased ability to understand the interpersonal networks evident in the manuscript.\n\nRAY SIEMENS is the Canada Research Chair in Humanities Computing and Professor of English at the University of Victoria with cross appointment in Computer Science.  Ray is the editor of several renaissance texts and the founding editor of the electronic scholarly journal, Early Modern Literary Studies. He has written numerous articles on the connections between computational methods and literary studies and is the co-editor of several humanities computing books such as Blackwell's Companion to Digital Humanities and Companion to Digital Literary Studies. Ray serves as Director of the Implementing New Knowledge Environments project, the Digital Humanities Summer Institute, and is President (English) of the Society for Digital Humanities/Société pour l'étude des médias interactifs (SDH/SEMI); he has also been Chair of the Modern Language Association's Committee on Information Technology and the MLA Discussion Group on Computers in Language and Literature.\n\nAll talks are free and open to the public!\n\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-8927)",

This talk explores programming practices in which other values are at work, showing that the aesthetics of code must be enlarged to accommodate them. The two practices considered are obfuscated programming and the creation of &quot;weird languages&quot;Ã‚Â for coding. Connections between these two practices, and between these and other mechanical and literary aesthetic traditions, are discussed.

    "wp post content": "<i>Cross-posted and edited from a blog entry on medium.com: </i><a href=\"https://medium.com/on-archivy/on-forgetting-e01a2b95272\"><i>On Forgetting and hydration</i></a><i>.</i>\n\n\n\nAfter writing about the <a href=\"http://inkdroid.org/journal/2014/08/30/a-ferguson-twitter-archive/\">Ferguson Twitter</a> archive a few months ago, I received requests from three people both outside and within University of Maryland, for access to the data. My response to the external academic researchers was to point them to <a href=\"https://dev.twitter.com/overview/terms/policy#6._Be_a_Good_Partner_to_Twitter\">Twitter’s Terms of Service</a> which says:\n\n<blockquote><i>If you provide Content to third parties, including downloadable datasets of Content or an API that returns Content, you will only distribute or allow download of Tweet IDs and/or User IDs.</i>\n\n\n\n<i>You may, however, provide export via non-automated means (e.g., download of spreadsheets or PDF files, or use of a “save as” button) of up to 50,000 public Tweets and/or User Objects per user of your Service, per day.</i>\n\n\n\n<i>Any Content provided to third parties via non-automated file download remains subject to this Policy.</i></blockquote>\n\nIt’s my understanding that I can share the data with others at the University of Maryland, but I am not able to give it to the external parties. What I can do is give them the Tweet IDs. But there are 13,480,000 of them.\n\n\n\nSo that’s what I’m doing today: publishing the tweet ids using a CC-BY license. You can download them from the Internet Archive:\n\n<blockquote><i><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/ferguson-tweet-ids\">https://archive.org/details/ferguson-tweet-ids</a></i></blockquote>\n\n<h3><b>Hydration</b></h3>\n\nOn the one hand, it seems unfair that this portion of the public record is unshareable in its most information rich form. The barrier to entry to using the data seems set artificially high in order to protect Twitter’s business interests. These messages were posted to the public Web, where I was able to collect them. Why are we prevented from re-publishing them since they are already on the Web? Why can’t we have lots of copies to keep stuff safe? More on this in a moment.\n\n\n\nTwitter limits users to 180 API requests every 15 minutes. A user is effectively a unique access token. Each request can hydrate up to 100 Tweet IDs using the <a href=\"https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/statuses/lookup\">statuses/lookup</a> REST API call. So\n\n<pre style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">180 requests * 100 tweets = 18,000 tweets/15 min\n\n                          = 72,000 tweets/hour\n\n</pre>\n\nIn order to hydrate all of the 13,480,000 tweets will take about 7.8 days. This is a bit of a pain, but realistically it’s not so bad. I’m sure people doing research have plenty of work to do before running any kind of analysis on the full data set. And they can use a portion of it for testing as it is downloading. But how do you download it?\n\n\n\n<a href=\"http://gnip.com/\">Gnip</a>, who were recently acquired by Twitter, offer a rehydration API. Their API is limited to tweets from the last 30 days, and similar to Twitter’s API you can fetch up to 100 tweets at a time. Unlike the Twitter API you can issue a request every second. So this means you could download the results in about 1.5 days. But these Ferguson tweets are more than 30 days old. And a Gnip account costs some indeterminate amount of money, starting at $500…\n\n\n\nI suspect there are other hydration services out there. But I adapted <a href=\"http://github.com/edsu/twarc\">twarc</a> the tool I used to collect the data, which already handled rate-limiting, to also do hydration. Once you have the tweet IDs in a file you just need to install twarc, and run it. Here’s how you would do that on an Ubuntu instance:\n\n<pre style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><code>\n\nsudo apt-get install python-pip\n\nsudo pip install twarc\n\ntwarc.py --hydrate ids.txt &gt; tweets.json\n\n</code>\n\n</pre>\n\n<h3><b>Archive Fever</b></h3>\n\nWell, not really. You will have <i>most </i>of them. But you won’t have the ones that have been deleted. If a user decided to remove a Tweet they made, or decided to remove their account entirely you won’t be able to get their Tweets back from Twitter using their API. I think it’s interesting to consider Twitter’s Terms of Service as what <a href=\"http://ischool.umd.edu/faculty-staff/katie-shilton\">Katie Shilton</a> would call a <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/dialogues/katie-shilton-finding-values-levers-building-ethics-into-emerging-technologies/\">value lever</a>.\n\n\n\nThe metadata rich JSON data (which often includes geolocation and other behavioral data) wasn’t exactly posted to the Web in the typical way. It was made available through a Web API designed to be used directly by automated agents, not people. A tweet appears on the Web, but it’s in with the other half a trillion tweets out on the Web, all the way back to the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/biz/status/21\">first one</a>. You have to ask for it individually with your Web browser. It’s representation format is HTML which doesn’t lend itself to computer processing in the same way as the highly structured JSON.\n\n\n\nRequiring researchers to go back to the Twitter API to get this data and not allowing it to circulate freely in bulk means that users have an opportunity to remove their content. Sure it has already been collected by other people, and it’s pretty unlikely that the NSA are deleting their tweets. But if you squint right, Twitter is taking an ethical position for their publishers to be able to remove their data: to exercise their right to be forgotten, allowing them to remove a teensy bit of what Maciej Cegłowski calls <a href=\"http://idlewords.com/bt14.htm\">informational toxic waste</a>.\n\n\n\nAs any archivist will tell you, forgetting is an essential and unavoidable part of the archive. Forgetting is the <i>why </i>of an archive. Negotiating what is to be remembered and by whom is the principal concern of the archive. Ironically it seems it’s the people who deserve it the least, those in positions of power, who are often most able to exercise their right to be forgotten. Maybe putting a value lever back in the hands of the people isn’t such a bad thing. If I were Twitter I’d highlight this in the API documentation. I think we are still learning how the contours of the Web fit into the archive. I know I am.\n\n\n\n<i>If you are interested in learning more about value levers you can download a pre-print of Shilton’s </i><a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/ShiltonSTHVpreprint.pdf\"><i>Value Levers: Building Ethics into Design</i></a><i>.</i>\n\n\n\n&nbsp;",

    "wp post content": "Today, the National Endowment for the Humanities' Office of Digital Humanities hosted project directors from 34 different projects representing recent awards from the Institutes for Advanced Topics in the Digital Humanities, the Digital Humanities Start-Up Grants, and the new Digital Humanities Implementation Grants. Three minutes, three powerpoint slides, and one project: it was a whirlwind of cutting-edge digital humanities highlights from across the country. MITH represented its recently awarded projects: Active OCR, led by Travis Brown, ANGLES and the Digital Humanities Data Curation Institutes, led by Trevor Muñoz, and Topic Modeling for Humanities Research.\n\nThe meeting itself is a great example of the innovative leadership the Office of Digital Humanities is demonstrating in its grant programs: providing a public platform for project directors to talk about their projects and meet one another presents opportunities for collaboration and information exchange that likely wouldn't take place otherwise.  I was delighted to be asked to present on publicizing your digital humanities project as part of a roundtable with Paula Wesley (NEH Office of Communications), Natalie Houston (University of Houston), and Sheila Brennan (CHNM @George Mason University). Here are a couple of quick lessons on how to promote your project:\n\n1.) <em>Pre-Planning</em> is your best friend. The first task we undertake on a project when it gets started is to grab all the various team members (scholars, developers, design team, etc) to discuss the project goals and what message we want to send about a project. We distill this into a couple of verbal bullet-points that allow us to address our audience. Who is your audience? What language do they use? What types of medium are they most comfortable with? Each of these needs to be answered to extend your project to those communities. Once everyone is clear on the project, the message, and the audience, we then spin up our publicity machine.\n<ul>\n\t<li>Logo: select a logo that visually represents your projects interests and goals. nothing too elaborate and nothing that can't be inverted into black-white or other colors.</li>\n\t<li>Tweet handle or hashtag: digital humanities is a community that likes its social media. Establish a twitter handle (or preferably a hashtag) that will allow you to monitor, gather, and contribute to the online community. It should conform to your brand. For example, our topic modeling workshop uses #dhtopic as its tag....the field of study (DH) coupled with the tech method (topic modeling). Make it short and sweet since you'll only have 144 characters everytime someone tweets.</li>\n</ul>\nOnce we've established those two things, we move onto our  MITH Project Page (<a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/research\">http://mith.umd.edu/research/current-projects/</a> ). A project page is hosted by MITH (forever) and basically captures our role in any given project (be it an event, conference, project, etc). We include:\n\na. project description\n\nb. participating staff\n\nc. project contact\n\nd. blog roll and recent tweets\n\ne. share functions (tweet, facebook, email, g+)\n\nf. project website link and Git repository\n\nThe project page updates itself once it has been set up. We automatically pull any tweet with the project tag to that page and automatically link as posts that have been tagged with the project tag. We then update the static portions annually to reflect what may have changed in terms of project goals and staffing.\n\nNow, you are asking what about building some snazzy project website? At MITH, we discuss what the scholarly goals of the project are. Where possible we deploy custom-themed CMS systems (Wordpress or Drupal) to be as efficient as possible with our time and resources (financial and staffing). More significantly, we know that projects evolve, primary investigators change or leave universities, and/or the project completes its work. By seperating the project page from the project site, we provide project staff more flexibility in updating without having to rely on MITH staff updating or limiting what technologies a project site might use.\n\nSo, you've got social media and a web profile under control. Now gather your thoughts to launch the publicity.\n\nAt MITH, we announce any significant issue for a project as well as regular development updates. They get posted to the MITH blog, tweeted via link, and sent out via listerv. We run google analytics to identify what are high traffic times for digital humanities and visitors to our site. For MITH, we get a little over 1,000 unique hits a month...most are concentrated in late mornings monday through thursday. We then launch our regular project announcements to post around 10 am with special announcements taking place around lunch time. This way, we catch the east coasters with regular announcements and the west coasters as they are getting into work. Plus, we catch our project partners across the pond so we aren't tweeting and posting while it is the dead of night.\n\nAll of our announcements include the funder twitter handle, a project URL, and our twitter handle.  Giving props to your funder is very important as your project wouldn't exist without their support. Because there is power in numbers, we also give our own staff a heads up on really significant announcements so they can deploy their re-tweeting and postings. One final note about tweeting/posting. MITH has branded a special hashtag #mithleaks to tease the public about our projects and on-going work. It allows us to flag people that something is coming and have a bit of fun at the same time.\n\nSince most of these things create a tweet/blog/post windfall, we also make sure to loop in our local stakeholders on projects. We send special notes to our campus constituents highlighting the projects that intersect with our University priorities. This is pivotal because we use these to generate interest from our local supporters: the College of Arts and Humanities, the University of Maryland Libraries, and the Office of the Vice President for Research. We also tap their promotional and publishing networks. By sharing information with them, they can help us identify appropriate media outlets. Plus, we get them interested in featuring our projects on UMD sites.\n\nNow that your project is getting out there, don't forget that you've got to report on its products. At MITH, we post (when possible) midterm and final reports. We also post a project completion blog that highlights what we've learned. We like these to coincide with major conferences and events of the constituent communities and audiences. It allows us to reach committed scholars while simultaneously providing the project team with the opportunity for feedback.\n\nWhen the project is completed, we crawl and archive the project website, gather the tweets and blogs, and package that as a digital file for our archives. Project members get a copy for their files and then we conduct an internal review. We return to our project goals, message, and audiences. Did we complete our goals, communicate our message, and reach the audience we intended? We then note what we need to change for next time.\n\nThis all seems like a lot (and it is) but you should also know we don't do this all on a daily basis. Tweets are scheduled via tweet scheduling, mail via mail chimp, blogs via regularly scheduled contributions where every team member takes a turn, and project updates on a quarterly basis. We set the schedules at the beginning of the semester for every project and then divide up responsibilities. Projects generally get awarded quarterly which means we are able to plan out months in advance and estimate when we will have major announcements.\n\nWhether you follow the process above or create one of your own, the principal remains the same: unless you promote your project, how will others know how cool it is?",

    "wp post content": "From May 6-8, 2015, MITH teamed up with <a href=\"http://film-media.dartmouth.edu/\">Dartmouth College</a> and the <a href=\"http://ischool.umd.edu/\">iSchool at University of Maryland</a> to host a workshop entitled Engaging the Public: Best Practices for Crowdsourcing across the Disciplines (<a href=\"http://www.crowdconsortium.org/\">CrowdCon</a>).  The goal of the workshop was to expand the ongoing conversations about best practices for engaging the public across both the humanities and the sciences, in order to build a networking bridge for crowdsourced research projects and to build a consortium to support such work.\n\nMuch attention has recently been given to ​“crowdsourced,” or “citizen science/citizen humanists” projects, which have developed across numerous fields, including the sciences, government, and education, both for knowledge generation and for increasing the level of engagement between online resources and the public. Crowdsourced projects now increasingly draw the attention of funders who recognize the value of these methodologies for public engagement and the generation of new knowledge.\n\nOver three days, CrowdCon discussed standards for evaluating and incorporating user-generated contributions and directions for the implementation of crowdsourcing efforts; established a national consortium among groups involved with these projects; and provided a means for funders to understand the opportunities and challenges for crowdsourcing.\n\nThis event was organized by Mary Flanagan (Dartmouth College), Neil Fraistat (MITH, University of Maryland), and Andrea Wiggins (iSchool, University of Maryland). CrowdCon was sponsored by The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), and the Sloan Foundation..\n\nMITH Winnemore Fellow Amanda Visconti provided thorough social media coverage of the event using the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23CrowdCon\">#CrowdCon</a> via Twitter.

    "wp post content": "<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/?csw=1\">Google Summer of Code</a> 2013 (GSoC 2013) has successfully come to an end. I would like to thank <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/people/person/james-smith/\" target=\"_blank\">James Smith</a> for his patient mentoring. His conceptions on professionalism and pragmatic problem solving approach were highly useful. It was a pleasure working with the MITH team.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/mithgrid-demonstration-development/\" target=\"_blank\">MITHgrid</a> library is a data-centric, event-driven, responsibility-based library. In the past three months, we have tried to make use of the library to build cool data-driven applications. Our objective for building these applications were three-fold:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>to add more components (presentations and controllers) to MITHgrid;</li>\n\t<li>to demonstrate the perks of using MITHgrid in terms of modularity and scalability;</li>\n\t<li>to drive public interest in MITHgrid.</li>\n</ol>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">MITHgrid builds on <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20131112221650/http://simile.mit.edu/wiki/Exhibit/Understanding_Exhibit_Database\">the data storage model</a> from <a href=\"http://simile-widgets.org/exhibit/\">MIT’s Exhibit project</a>. The model provides some benefits over a relational database. MITHgrid is different than more commonly available MVC JavaScript frameworks and is aligned to scale with the requirements of future graph-based web applications.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What we accomplished</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The primary objective of GSoC 2013 was to learn and contribute to open source endeavors, learn programming ethics, and collaborate with team members. We are satisfied with the results, and I hope to internalize the lessons from this endeavor.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Over the summer, we managed to create two MITHgrid applications of varying complexities and a skeleton application template for use with Yeoman (available <a href=\"https://github.com/selvam1991/mithgrid-demos/tree/master/demo\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/selvam1991/generator-mithgrid\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>):</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>A Data Visualizer</strong>: This is a simple application which allows data imports, visualizations of those imports using available plots, and live editing of values. The modified data may be exported for use later. For the visualizer, we created graphs, spreadsheet, editable table, and tab presentations (comparable to <a href=\"http://backbonejs.org/\">Backbone.js</a> views). These presentations can now be used for any other MITHgrid application.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>ToDo App</strong>: Very simple to-do list for your day. The reason why we wanted to build such an easy application was to get listed on <a href=\"http://todomvc.com/\">todomvc.com</a>, a site that allows you to compare JavaScript frameworks by showing the same application implemented in all of them. As part of this application, we created custom mouse controllers for capturing browser events. Now they can be used with any MITHgrid application.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Problems we faced</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Well, you do face problems whenever you start using a new library, but we would like to mention some notable difficulties that we came across:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>There is no memory of the order in which the data was loaded;</li>\n\t<li>The absence of global (within the scope of MITHgrid) namespace in which to save and access variables. Because a web page might have multiple instances of an application, we employ a more roundabout approach: we pass the application object reference to components that need central management of some piece of information.</li>\n</ol>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Future plans</strong></p>\nWe have a good head start, thanks to GSoC. Our focus henceforth will be to streamline and build reusable components for MITHgrid. For users to truly appreciate the usability of the library, they should have access to a  comprehensive toolkit. Similar libraries such as backbone.js offer an extensive toolkit that MITHgrid currently lacks. Another focus will be to build more complex scalable applications using third party APIs. In today's world, inter-operable systems are everywhere, and a library that wishes to be widely accepted needs to embrace it.",

    "wp post content": "The <a href=\"http://uvasci.org/about-sci/\" target=\"_blank\">Scholarly Communication Institute</a> (SCI) is currently convening for their ninth annual meeting at the <a href=\"http://www.virginia.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">University of Virginia</a>, July 13-15, 2011. Funded by the <a href=\"http://www.mellon.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</a>, the SCI seeks to study, develop, and implement creative and innovative strategies to advance scholarly communication in the context of the ongoing digital revolution. This year’s meeting entitled <em>New-Model Scholarly Communication: Road Map for Change</em> brings together scholars, librarians, publishers, higher education administrators, and funders noted for their innovative approaches to scholarly communication. The participants have been charged with assessing new models of humanities publishing, creating a road map for catalyzing the most promising of them, and developing implementation strategies.\n\nI am currently in attendance at SCI9, and recently gave the following talk about <a href=\"http://digitalhumanities.org/centernet/\" target=\"_blank\">centerNet</a> and the <a href=\"http://chcinetwork.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes</a> (CHCI) during a lightning round with Jim Chandler, Director of the <a href=\"http://franke.uchicago.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Franke Institute for the Humanities</a>, <a href=\"http://www.uchicago.edu\" target=\"_blank\">University of Chicago</a>:\n\nAs Jim suggests, both humanities centers and digital humanities centers have been historically positioned to help set the agenda for the new humanities to come. Disciplinary innovation and transformation are their institutional legacy and obligation. Their ultimate success at what Percy Shelley has called “the far goal of time,” will not only be measured by whether the two kinds of centers have become one, but whether they have helped to produce a more profoundly interdisciplinary, collaborative, and internationalized humanities, one that incorporates quantitative and computational methodologies and emerging technologies, one that is no longer the “other” to science. Well, “You say you want a revolution. . . We’d all love to see the plan.”\n\nHow can these two networks help to bring this transformation about? Beyond the initiatives Jim has mentioned, the two organizations have agreed to work together to build scholarly and technical capacity in the humanities by way of shared grant projects, shared training, and shared events, beginning with the very successful joint conference recently held at the <a href=\"http://www.utoronto.ca\" target=\"_blank\">University of Toronto</a>. In the short term, we’ll be working together also on such issues as credentialing humanities work that is collaborative, interdisciplinary, or digital; on impact assessment of humanities work and advocating for its importance; on further internationalizing the membership of our coalitions; on developing new curricular models and degrees; on making students active agents in knowledge production; on supporting new and innovative models for the publication and refereeing of humanities scholarship; on reaching beyond the academy to create a more truly public and interactive humanities; on working with funders to shape new opportunities that foster international collaborations; on advocating for our funders; and on nurturing a new generation of hybrid scholars, working in staff positions that combine service and research components. All of these initiatives are crucial to achieving the larger changes we seek. And those changes are social, cultural, and even economic, as much as they are technological. Achieving them means making common cause with University Libraries and iSchools, two academic units that are converging with centers in powerful ways to constitute the digital humanities and to reconstitute the humanities. It also means working with scholarly associations, university presses, and cultural memory institutions. We have passed beyond what has been called the “Jacobin Imaginary” and may have entered an era of the “Consortial Imaginary”: to make a revolution in the humanities we must be centers with large circumferences.\n\nFollow the discussions at SCI on Twitter under hashtag <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23sci9\" target=\"_blank\">#sci9</a>.",

    "wp post content": "As part of the ongoing collaboration between the University of Maryland Libraries and MITH, the Libraries have allocated a portion of collections funds to expand the number of books related to the digital humanities available to our community. Kelsey Corlett-Rivera, Librarian for the School of Languages, Literatures, and Culture, has served as liaison to MITH and has worked with our staff to develop and build these collections, which have grown by almost 50 titles over the last two years.\n\n\n\nMost of these books (as well as others related to digital humanities) can be seen through the WorldCat portal at the link for the list <a href=\"https://umaryland.worldcat.org/profiles/kcr1@umd.edu/lists/3027340\">Digital Humanities at the UMD Libraries</a>.  Here are some highlights that you’ll find in the collection:\n\n\n\n<strong><a href=\"https://umaryland.worldcat.org/title/emergence-of-the-digital-humanities/oclc/798062120?referer=list_view\">The emergence of the digital humanities</a></strong> by Steven E. Jones\n\n\n\n(New York : Routledge, 2014)\n\n\n\n“The Emergence of the Digital Humanities provocatively maps the larger trajectory of digital humanities research and more recent kinds of new digital humanities work. Jones maps the ‘eversion’ that characterizes our everyday lives, exploring the metaphorical and material implications of the networks that surround us. His book brings new insights about the networks that make up our culture, our commerce, and our creativity.\" -Danny Anderson, Dean, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, University of Kansas.\n\n\n\n<strong><a href=\"https://umaryland.worldcat.org/title/paper-knowledge-toward-a-media-history-of-documents/oclc/854906247?referer=list_view\">Paper knowledge : toward a media history of documents</a></strong> by Lisa Gitelman\n\n\n\n(Durham : Duke University Press, 2014)\n\n\n\nA book about the mundane: the library card, the promissory note, the movie ticket, the PDF (Portable Document Format). Whether examining late-nineteenth-century commercial, or \"job\" printing, or the Xerox machine and the role of reproduction in our understanding of the document, it reveals a keen eye for vernacular uses of technology.\n\n\n\n<strong><a href=\"https://umaryland.worldcat.org/title/oral-literature-in-the-digital-age-archiving-orality-and-connecting-with-communities/oclc/846888889?referer=list_view\">Oral literature in the digital age : archiving orality and connecting with communities</a></strong> edited by Mark Turin, Claire Wheeler and Eleanor Wilkinson\n\n\n\n(Cambridge, England : Open Book Publishers, 2013)\n\n\n\nThanks to ever-greater digital connectivity, interest in oral traditions has grown beyond that of researcher and research subject to include a widening pool of global users. When new publics consume, manipulate and connect with field recordings and digital cultural archives, their involvement raises important practical and ethical questions. This volume explores the political repercussions of studying marginalised languages; the role of online tools in ensuring responsible access to sensitive cultural materials; and ways of ensuring that when digital documents are created, they are not fossilized as a consequence of being archived. Fieldwork reports by linguists and anthropologists in three continents provide concrete examples of overcoming barriers-ethical, practical and conceptual-in digital documentation projects. Oral Literature in the Digital Age is an essential guide and handbook for ethnographers, field linguists, community activists, curators, archivists, librarians, and all who connect with indigenous communities in order to document and preserve oral traditions.\n\n\n\n<strong><a href=\"https://umaryland.worldcat.org/title/debates-in-the-digital-humanities/oclc/759909869?referer=list_view\">Debates in the digital humanities</a> </strong>edited by Matthew K. Gold\n\n\n\n(Minneapolis : University of Minnesota Press, c2012)\n\n\n\nClearly the digital humanities has reached a significant moment in its brief history. But what sort of moment is it? Debates in the Digital Humanities brings together leading figures in the field to explore its theories, methods, and practices and to clarify its multiple possibilities and tensions. From defining what a digital humanist is and determining whether the field has (or needs) theoretical grounding, to discussions of coding as scholarship and trends in data-driven research, this cutting-edge volume delineates the current state of the digital humanities and envisions potential futures and challenges. At the same time, several essays aim pointed critiques at the field for its lack of attention to race, gender, class, and sexuality; the inadequate level of diversity among its practitioners; its absence of political commitment; and its preference for research over teaching.\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n<strong><a href=\"https://umaryland.worldcat.org/title/digital-libraries-and-the-challenges-of-digital-humanities/oclc/61529070?referer=list_view\">Digital libraries and the challenges of digital humanities</a></strong> by Jeffrey A Rydberg-Cox\n\n\n\n(Oxford : Chandos, 2006)\n\n\n\nOne of the major challenges facing librarians and curators of digital repositories are the innovative 'born digital' documents created by scholars in the humanities. These documents range from the parsed corpora created by linguists to traditional reference information presented in electronic databases, to rich, multi-media hypertexts combining audio, still and moving video and text, and many other sorts of material. Too often, librarians think of electronic resources solely as providing access to subscription databases. This book encourages librarians to think holistically of the life cycle of electronic resources from new items being created at their institution, to end-user access, to long term preservation of digital resources.\n\n\n\nThanks to Kelsey Corlett-Rivera and the University Libraries for enhancing access to research resources for digital humanities at Maryland.",

    "wp post content": "As a new semester is about to begin academics are busily putting finishing touches on their course syllabi. Here at the University of Maryland there has been sustained interest over the past few months in integrating discussion and thinking about the recent events in Ferguson, and subsequent #BlackLivesMatter movement into our classes. Look for news about planned teach-ins and events like <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/researching-ferguson-update-previewing-miths-teach-ins-blacklivesmatter-umd/\">ours</a> in the coming weeks.\n\n\n\nIf you are interested in finding Ferguson and #BlackLivesMatter resources to use in your coursework one place to look is the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23fergusonsyllabus\">#FergusonSyllabus</a> hashtag on Twitter. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/drmchatelain\">Marcia Chatelain</a>, a history professor at Georgetown University and a University of Missouri–Columbia alumna, started this hashtag with this tweet back in August of 2014:\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/FergusonSyllabus?src=hash\">#FergusonSyllabus</a>: \"Black in Blue: African-American Police Officers and Racism,\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JamesLoewen\">@JamesLoewen</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TouchstoneBooks\">@TouchstoneBooks</a>\n\n\n\n— Dr. Marcia Chatelain (@DrMChatelain) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrMChatelain/status/501042404196376576\">August 17, 2014</a></blockquote>\n\nYou can <a href=\"http://news.stlpublicradio.org/post/educators-use-twitter-teach-about-ferguson-build-syllabuses\">listen</a> to an interview with Chatelain from Saint-Louis Public Radio soon conducted just a few days after this tweet. Since then there have been over 8,000 tweets with the #FergusonSyllabus hashtag. Chatelain wrote a post about her favorite <a href=\"http://www.dissentmagazine.org/blog/teaching-ferguson-syllabus\">suggested resources</a>, and you can find other lists, such as this <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kwZl23Q9tgZ23dxSJWS-WpjZhOZ_mzVPtWL8-pWuLt8/edit?usp=sharing\">Google Doc</a> from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dankrutka\">Daniel Krutka</a>, a Professor of Education at Texas Woman's University.\n\n\n\nHere at MITH we have a collection of these tweets between August 17th 2014 and January 7th, 2015.

Body Shots puts the human body at the center of cinema's first decade of emergence, arguing for the complexity, richness, and sophistication of these moving corporeal representations as both formal objects and culturally resonant ones. Rather than treat the body as primarily marking identity--gendered, racial, national--or invoke it to make claims about early cinema's sensational attractions in relation to modernity (two common approaches to the subject), I begin by focusing on films that reveal striking anxieties and preoccupations about persons on public display, both exceptional figures, such as1896 presidential candidate William McKinley, as well as ordinary people self-consciously caught by the movie camera in their daily routines.

Eligible candidates will have completed a doctoral program in African American Studies, Art History, United States Labor History, United States or Global Migration Studies,  Digital Media, Historical and Cultural Visualization, or a related field in the past five years. These are full-time, professional-track faculty appointments for two years connected to our Andrew W. Mellon-funded initiative “Synergies among Digital Humanities and African American History and Culture” ( AADHum). The 12-month salary for these positions is $70,000, including full benefits. Additional funding is available for conference travel and professional development.</span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The AADHum postdocs in the fields of Digital Humanities and African American History and Culture provide exciting opportunities to contribute to a major interdisciplinary initiative at one of the nation’s highest-ranked public research universities, as well as to gain skills and knowledge related to emerging, innovative areas of research and teaching.

As Assistant Director, Jennifer will help initiate and manage MITH’s  grant projects, work with our Fellows, and supervise our development  team of programmers, web designers, graduate students, and interns.\n\nJennifer  currently serves as Associate Director of the <a href=\"http://cdh.sc.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Center for Digital  Humanities</a> at <a href=\"http://www.sc.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">University of South Carolina</a>, as well as Research  Assistant Professor in USC’s Department of History. She brings a wealth  of project management and grant writing expertise to MITH, having served  as the grant writer and co-primary investigator on a variety of  <a href=\"http://www.neh.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">National Endowment for the Humanities</a> (NEH) and <a href=\"http://www.nsf.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">National Science  Foundation</a> (NSF) funded projects. She is currently involved in an  NEH-funded Digging into Image Data project that centers on cultural  heritage objects. The research team, co-managed by MATRIX, the National  Center for Supercomputing Applications at University of Illinois, and  the University of Sheffield (UK), is applying computational analysis and  universal algorithms to cultural heritage materials, such as maps,  quilts, and manuscripts, from the 15th to 21st centuries. In addition to  her passion for project management and aptitude for grant writing,  Jennifer’s scholarly interest in colonial maps of the Native American  territories and image culture drive her current involvement in the  project.\n\nJennifer  holds a Ph.D. in History from <a href=\"http://illinois.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign</a>.  Her research interests include United States History since 1815,  particularly Native American culture, and issues of race, ethnicity and  cultural hybridity in visual material. While at Illinois, Jennifer  became more interested in digital spaces and the field of digital  humanities. She is fascinated by “the ways in which the questions of  history -- cause and effect, narrative, how people envision themselves  and their own culture -- lead to questions of accessibility and how  people produce their identity through their own material.”\n\nFor  Jennifer, “MITH is a place characterized by disciplinary innovation,  with a deep interest in high quality research, theory, and public  engagement.” MITH’s Director Neil Fraistat notes, “We are delighted that  Jennifer will be joining us. She brings estimable digital humanities  expertise and experience, a sophisticated understanding of how to manage  complex projects, and a wide-ranging, interdisciplinary set of  intellectual interests -- not to mention a great sense of humor. With  the recent hiring of Associate Director Trevor Muñoz and the move of  current Assistant Director Dave Lester to the position of Creative Lead,  MITH has a new generation of leadership poised to boldly go where no dh  center has gone before.”\n\nJennifer begins her appointment August 17th.

    "wp post content": "The Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH), in partnership with the University of Maryland Libraries, is pleased to announce our selection as a<a href=\"http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/ndsr/index.html\"> National Digital Stewardship Residency</a> (NDSR) host site.\n\nThis program offers an opportunity for recent graduates of Master’s degree programs in relevant fields to complete a nine-month residency at institutions actively engaged in the acquisition, stewardship, and preservation of born-digital materials. The residency will begin in September 2013, with a two-week workshop at the Library of Congress. Prospective applicants should visit the<a href=\"http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/ndsr/applicationinfo.html\"> NDSR website</a> for application information.\n\nMITH and the University of Maryland Libraries are proud to join such organizations as the Folger Shakespeare Library, The National Library of Medicine, and the Smithsonian Institution Archives among others as host institutions for this timely program. The survival of important collections—particularly born-digital collections—depends on their discoverability, accessibility, and usability by diverse constituencies. The interfaces and the service models that welcome interested researchers are important points of human connection between collections and communities. As more and more institutions add born-digital materials to their collections, they will need individuals capable of developing and implementing policies and access models where none existed previously. A residency at MITH will help provide the necessary background to successfully articulate issues surrounding access of born-digital archival collections and the expertise to provide solutions. In particular, the Resident will have an opportunity to engage with unique born-digital literary collections from two prominent authors at the leading edge of experimental electronic literature. At the same time, the Resident will contribute important research and be well positioned to provide leadership on issues that every library and archive will confront in the coming years.\n\nAs an NDSR Host, MITH and the Libraries will provide guidance and resources for the Resident to prototype access points to born-digital materials (including their physical carriers) to better enable researchers to discover and work with the Libraries’ born-digital collections. Matthew Kirschenbaum, Associate Director of MITH and Associate Professor in the Department of English at the University of Maryland, and Joanne Archer, Special Collections Librarian at the University of Maryland Libraries along with staff from MITH, the Human-Computer Interaction Lab of the University of Maryland iSchool, and the University of Maryland Libraries will work with the Resident to aid them in gaining demonstrable experience with reference models, user-centered design, and prototyping. MITH Director Neil Fraistat observes that “the NDSR is a key component of the groundbreaking partnership MITH and the Libraries initiated in 2012, to collaborate on research and services related to born-digital collections. The Resident will be embedded with this interdisciplinary, cross-divisional team, the Born-Digital Working Group.”\n\nFor more about the potential scope of an NDSR residency at MITH, see our <a href=\"http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/ndsr/hosts.html\">formal host statement</a>.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>The Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) is a leading digital humanities center that pursues disciplinary innovation and institutional transformation through applied research, public programming, and educational opportunities.

The project will develop an innovative approach to helping users search, browse, analyze, and share content from distributed online collections. OAAP will incorporate recent Web 2.0 technologies to help users discover and use relevant source materials in languages other than English and will improve users' ability to find relevant materials using domain-specific vocabulary searches. Two online collections of materials in English and Spanish, The Early Americas Digital Archive (EADA), and a new digital archive of materials to be developed at Rice, will provide an initial corpus for testing the tools. Rice principle investigators, Geneva Henry (Executive Director, Digital Library Initiative) and Caroline Levander (HRC Director), along with MITH co-PI Neil Fraistat are undertaking this innovative digital humanities project with a view to supporting scholarly inquiry into the Americas from a hemispheric perspective. As Geneva Henry says, &quot;our goal is to develop new ways of doing research as well as new objects of study--to create a new, interactive community of scholarly inquiry.&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo significant online collections of materials in English and Spanish supporting the interdisciplinary field of hemispheric American Studies--Maryland's Early Americas Digital Archive (EADA) [http://www.mith2.umd.edu/eada/] and a new digital archive of multilingual materials being developed at Rice [http://rudr.rice.edu/handle/1911/9219]--provide an initial corpus for developing and testing these new digital tools. The two multilingual archives illustrate the complex politics and histories that characterize the American hemisphere, but they also provide unique opportunities to further digital research in the humanities. Geographic visualization as well as new social tagging and tag cloud cluster models are just some of the new interface techniques that the Our Americas Archive Partnership will develop with the goal of creating innovative research pathways. As Caroline Levander comments, &quot;we see this as a first step in furthering scholarly dialogue and research across borders by making hemispheric material available open access worldwide. &quot;Our goal is to further develop innovative research tools that will help generate a collaborative, transnational research community.&quot;  Ralph Bauer, MITH Fellow, general editor of the Early Americas Digital Archive, and collaborator on the project adds, &quot;the added digital materials and tools to navigate seamlessly through these two collections is enabling new forms of scholarship. Because the OAAP makes available materials that are dispersed in different geographic locations, it facilitates collaboration and intellectual exchange among an international audience. The digital medium offers rich opportunities for multicultural exchanges and is therefore uniquely suited for a hemispheric approach to history.&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&quot;Incorporating Web 2.0 techniques to enhance work with valuable scholarly content that's held in distributed repositories allows users to both discover and create new knowledge that would otherwise remain untapped,&quot; notes Neil Fraistat, Director of MITH. Currently, researchers have difficulty finding and organizing relevant electronic resources, given the multiple systems in which they reside and the heterogeneous vocabularies used to describe them. Further complexities arise when issues such as finding relevant materials in a different language and searching with domain-specific vocabularies are considered. By conforming to best practices in library and information science while incorporating recent Web 2.0 technologies, OAAP will address these important issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Cultural institutions energize their communities by not just preserving culture, heritage, and knowledge, but by supporting life-long learning and engagement. National Leadership Grants harness the work of the best of these institutions. By promoting innovation and partnerships, they allow these institutions to create national models that address the challenges of the broader library and museum communities, and help strengthen their impact,&quot; stated Anne-Imelda M. Radice, PhD, Director of IMLS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNational Leadership Grants help libraries and museums collaborate, build digital resources, and conduct research and demonstration projects. The selected projects are national models that will help foster individual achievement, community responsibility, and life-long learning. This year the program had 213 applicants requesting more than $78 million. 43 awards were made, totaling $18,661,716 with an additional $24 million provided in matching funds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Institute of Museum and Library Services is the primary source of federal support for the nation's 122,000 libraries and 17,500 museums. Its mission is to grow and sustain a &quot;Nation of Learners&quot; because life-long learning is essential to a democratic society and individual success. Through its grant making, convenings, research and publications, the Institute empowers museums and libraries nationwide to provide leadership and services to enhance learning in families and communities, sustain cultural heritage, build twenty-first-century skills, and increase civic participation.

    "wp post content": "I've been thinking a lot lately about the significance of small projects in an increasingly large-scale DH environment.  We seem almost inherently to know the value of \"big data:\" scale changes the name of the game.  Still, what about the smaller universes of projects with minimal budgets, fewer collaborators, and limited scopes, which also have large ambitions about what can be done using the digital resources we have on hand?  Rather than detracting from the import of big data projects, I, like <a href=\"http://digitalvictorian.org/2012/03/the-middle-distance/\" target=\"_blank\">Natalie Houston</a>, am wondering what small projects offer the field and whether those potential outcomes are relevant and useful both in and of themselves as well as beneficial to large-scale projects, such as in fine-tuning initial results.\n\nMy project in its current iteration involves a limited dataset of about 4500 poems and challenges rudimentary assumptions about a particular genre of poetry called ekphrasis—poems regarding the visual arts.  It is the capstone project to a dissertation in which I use the methods of social network analysis to explore socially-inscribed relationships between visual and verbal media and in which the results of my analysis are rendered visually to demonstrate the versatility and flexibility available to female poets writing ekphrastic poetry. My MITH project concludes my dissertation by demonstrating that network analysis is one way of disrupting existing paradigms for understanding the social-signification of ekphrastic poetry, but there are more methods available through computational tools such as text modeling, word frequency analysis, and classification that might also be useful.\n\nTo this end, I've begun by asking three modest questions about ekphrastic poetry using a machine learning application called <a href=\"http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">MALLET</a>:\n<ol>\n\t<li>Could a computer learn to differentiate between ekphrastic poems by male and female poets?  In \"Ekphrasis and the Other,\" W.J.T. Mitchell argues that were we to read ekphrastic poems by women as opposed to ekphrastic poetry by men, that we might find a very different relationship between the active, speaking poetic voice and the passive, silent work of art—a dynamic which informs our primary understanding of how ekphrastic poetry operates.  Were this true and were the difference to occur within recurring topics and language use, a computer might be trained to recognize patterns more likely to co-occur in poetry by men or by women.</li>\n\t<li>Will topic modeling of ekphrastic texts pick out \"stillness\" as one of the most common topics in the genre?  Much of the definition of ekphrasis revolves around the language of stillness: poetic texts, it has been argued, contemplate the stillness and muteness of the image with which it is engaged.  Stillness, metaphorically linked to muteness, breathlessness, and death, provides one of the most powerful rationales for an understanding how words and images relate to one another within the ut pictura poesis tradition—usually seen as an hostile encounter between rival forms of representation.  The argument to this point has been made largely on critical interpretations enacted through close readings of a limited number of texts.  Would a computer designed to recognize co-occurrences of words and assign those words to a \"topic\" based on the probability they would occur together also reveal a similar affiliation between stillness and death, muteness, even femininity?</li>\n\t<li>Would a computer be able to ascertain stylistic and semantic differences between ekphrastic and non-ekphrastic texts and reliably classify them according to whether or not the subject of the poem is an aesthetic object or not?  We tend to believe that there are no real differences between how we describe the natural world as opposed to how we describe visual representations of the natural world.  We base this assumption on human, interpretive, close readings of  poetic texts; however, there is the potential that a computer might recognize subtle differences as statistically significant when considering hundreds of poems at a time.  If a classification program such as Mallet could reliably categorize texts according to ekphrastic and non-ekphrastic, it is possible that we have missed something along the way.</li>\n</ol>\nIn general, these are small questions constructed in such a way that there is a reasonable likelihood that we may get useful results.  (I purposefully choose the word results instead of answers, because none of these would be answers.  Instead the result of each study is designed to turn critics back to the texts with new questions.)  And yet, how do we distinguish between useful results and something else?  How do we know if it worked?  Lots of money is spent trying to answer this question about big data, but what about these small and mid-sized data sets?  Is there a threshold for how much data we need to be accurate and trustworthy?  Can we actually develop standards for how much data we need to ask particular kinds of humanities questions to make relevant discoveries?  In part, my project also addresses these questions, because otherwise, I can't make convincing arguments about the humanities questions I'm asking.\n\nSmall projects (even mid-sized projects with mid-sized datasets) offer the promise of richly encoded data that can be tested, reorganized, and applied flexibly to a variety of contexts without potentially becoming the entirety of a project director's career.  The space between close, highly-supervised readings and distant, unsupervised analysis remains wide open as a field of study, and yet its potential value as a manageable, not wholly consuming, and reproducible option make it worth seriously considering.  What exactly can be accomplished by small and mid-scale projects is largely unknown, but it may well be that small and mid-sized projects are where many scholars will find the most satisfying and useful results.\n\n<em>Lisa Rhody is a Ph.D. candidate in English at the University of Maryland, a Spring 2012 MITH Winnemore Dissertation Fellow, and a lecturer on the arts for the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts.

    "wp post content": "If you haven't heard of <a title=\"http://www.w3.org/community/openannotation/\" href=\"http://www.w3.org/community/openannotation/\" target=\"_blank\">Open Annotation,</a> then you’re missing out on the greatest thing since virtual sliced bread. Something as simple as saying, “this should be associated with that,” is powerful. The simple things often are.\n\nWe’re used to blogs with comments. Each comment is a piece of text associated with the blog entry or another comment. Systems like <a title=\"http://wordpress.org/\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Wordpress</a> or <a title=\"http://www.movabletype.org/\" href=\"http://www.movabletype.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Movable Type</a> own the comments. They store the comments in the same database as the other content. Comment providers such as <a title=\"http://disqus.com/\" href=\"http://disqus.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Disqus</a> manage all of the comments in their own database and associate them with the appropriate blog page.\n\nOpen Annotation goes one step further. With Open Annotation, the comments could be stored anywhere and still be associated with the blog entry.\n\nOpen Annotation frees commentary by allowing anyone to own the commentary, anyone else to own the object under discussion, and yet another person to make the associations between the comments and the object. In fact, Open Annotation could be one of the enabling technologies for Alan Liu's <a title=\"http://liu.english.ucsb.edu/peopling-the-police-a-social-computing-approach-to-information-authority-in-the-age-of-web-20-dhsi-u-victoria/\" href=\"http://liu.english.ucsb.edu/peopling-the-police-a-social-computing-approach-to-information-authority-in-the-age-of-web-20-dhsi-u-victoria/\" target=\"_blank\">vision of opt-in communities for information authority (a.k.a. censorship and peer review).</a> You get to decide whose annotations you want to use.\n\nMITH has been part of the Open Annotation Collaboration for a few years now. Over the last year, we worked with <a title=\"http://alexanderstreet.com/\" href=\"http://alexanderstreet.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Alexander Street Press</a> to develop a <a title=\"http://umd-mith.github.com/OACVideoAnnotator/\" href=\"http://umd-mith.github.com/OACVideoAnnotator/\" target=\"_blank\">JavaScript library</a> that lets you add video annotation capabilities to your website.\n\nIt's a bit raw still, but it provides the basic framework. With a little effort and comfort with JavaScript (especially closures and anonymous functions), you can make it work with your application. If you want to use a video player other than HTML5, you need to <a title=\"http://umd-mith.github.com/OACVideoAnnotator/docs/drivers/\" href=\"http://umd-mith.github.com/OACVideoAnnotator/docs/drivers/\" target=\"_blank\">write a driver</a> that lets the library control the player. If you want to allow annotations other than text, you need to write some JavaScript that lets the library know how you want the annotation body rendered. If you want to be able to pick out parts of images that aren’t rectangles or ellipses, again, you can write a bit of JavaScript and you’ll be good to go.\n\nIn the spirit of Open Annotation, our library doesn't demand any particular integration into your website. You get to decide how you want people to interact with the video annotation capabilities. You get to decide how annotations are stored or discovered. The <a title=\"http://umd-mith.github.com/OACVideoAnnotator/javascripts/docs/demo.html\" href=\"http://umd-mith.github.com/OACVideoAnnotator/javascripts/docs/demo.html\" target=\"_blank\">source code</a> of our <a title=\"http://umd-mith.github.com/OACVideoAnnotator/demo.html\" href=\"http://umd-mith.github.com/OACVideoAnnotator/demo.html\" target=\"_blank\">demo</a> is a good place to start to see how you can use the library.\n\nOf course, this flexibility means that you have to do a little work to use it. If the prospect of annotating video intrigues you but you don't have time to incorporate it into a platform such as Wordpress or Drupal, hang on for a year. We’re going to be developing a Drupal plugin that will let you add video annotation to almost any HTML5 video on your Drupal site. We’ll also add more documentation and tutorials.\n\n<em>James Smith is MITH's Software Architect.

Within Bamboo, MITH is leading Corpora Space. We are designing research environments where scholars may discover, analyze and curate digital texts across the 450 years of print culture in English from 1473 until 1923, along with the texts from the Classical world upon which that print culture is based. We are initially focusing on the following collections: <a href=\"http://www.austlit.edu.au/\" target=\"_blank\">AUSTLit</a>; <a href=\"http://www.nines.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Nineteenth-century Scholarship Online</a> (NINES); <a href=\"http://books.google.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Google Books</a>; <a href=\"http://www.hathitrust.org/\" target=\"_blank\">HathiTrust</a>; <a href=\"http://ota.ahds.ac.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Oxford Text Archive</a>; <a href=\"http://www.perseus.tufts.edu\" target=\"_blank\">Perseus Digital Library</a>; and <a href=\"http://www.lib.umich.edu/tcp/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Text Creation Partnership</a> of Early English Books Online (EEBO) and Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO).\n\n\n\nAs part of the design phase, Corpora Space held a series of workshops over the past eight months. The first meeting between Bamboo and Google gave Corpora Space partners insight into Google’s design principles and process. The second workshop brought together software developers and scholars for a three-day <span class=\"removed_link\" title=\"http://www.projectbamboo.org/corporacamp-outcomes/\">CorporaCamp</span> at MITH.<a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/woodchipper_lg.png\"><img class=\"alignleft\" title=\"Woodchipper_CorporaCamp\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/woodchipper_sm.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"132\" /></a> Over the course of the three days, participants successfully built the Woodchipper, a prototype application for exploring distributed, large-scale collections through visualizations supported by techniques from data mining and natural language processing. The Woodchipper has been tested across large subsets—up to several hundred million words — of the HathiTrust Digital Library, EEBO-TCP and ECCO-TCP, and the Perseus Digital Library. It allows users to build collections of texts from across these sources and to explore these collections by mapping them in a two-dimensional thematic space. (We are currently inviting users to <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/corporacamp/signup.php\" target=\"_blank\">alpha test</a> the Woodchipper).\n\n\n\nMITH held ToolMixer, the third workshop in the Corpora Space Design process, on June 6-7. Tool builders, scholars, and members of Project Bamboo met to work on key issues related to connecting tools and architecture to digital collections. Project Bamboo partners were joined by representatives of the <a href=\"http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/scholarslab/\" target=\"_blank\">Scholars’ Lab</a> at the University of Virginia, <a href=\"http://www.nines.org/\" target=\"_blank\">NINES</a> and <a href=\"http://www.18thconnect.org/\" target=\"_blank\">18thConnect</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hathitrust.org/\" target=\"_blank\">HathiTrust Research Center</a>, <span class=\"removed_link\" title=\"http://seasr.org/\">SEASR</span>, <a href=\"http://www.unl.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">University of Nebraska-Lincoln</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.ucr.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">University of California Riverside</a> to hear presentations from tool builders and plan how tools would connect to the Corpora Space infrastructure. Additionally, we conducted break-out sessions to discuss how the various tools would link together in a scholarly workflow. This workshop brought us significantly closer to finalizing decisions about the core set of tools to be included in the initial implementation phase of Corpora Space, slated for Spring 2012.\n\n\n\nOur live tweets from the two-day event are archived under <a href=\"http://twapperkeeper.com/hashtag/toolmix\" target=\"_blank\">#toolmix</a>.

    "wp post content": "MITH has been involved in the <a title=\"Open Annotation Collaboration\" href=\"http://www.openannotation.org/\">Open Annotation Collaboration</a> for a couple of years now, helping develop a standard way to express annotations on the web using <a title=\"Linked Data\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data\">linked data</a> principles. Last week, several in the OAC community met in Chicago to show a series of experiments testing the annotation data model and to discuss the next steps we need to take.\n\nIn one of the experiments, MITH worked with <a title=\"Alexander Street Press\" href=\"http://alexanderstreet.com/\">Alexander Street Press</a> to create a developer’s toolkit that lets you add video annotation to your web pages with only a little JavaScript coding, styling, and some kind of server side storage to keep the annotations around for later.\n\nThe toolkit allows you to address time spans as well as areas within a frame as targets for annotation. It comes with code to provide rectangular and elliptical areas, but it’s easy to add new shapes with only a little code. The demonstration shows how to add controls and visualization of the annotation body as well as import and export annotations using RDF/JSON.\n\nThe experiment pointed out a few areas where the Open Annotation data model needed some extra work when expressing annotations of parts of videos, namely, being able to specify the size of the video play surface on which the annotation target was drawn. MITH will be working with others in the community over the next month to find some options that the W3C community group can discuss at their next meeting in September.\n\nThe Open Annotation Collaboration is ending most of its standards development efforts, folding them into <a title=\"Open Annotation Community Group\" href=\"http://www.w3.org/community/openannotation/\">a new W3C community group</a> that brings together the OAC community and the Annotation Ontology community. As mentioned above, the W3C community will be meeting in September to discuss several open problems that came up at the meeting in Chicago.\n\nOAC is continuing to develop several of the experiments into open source projects that can serve as examples of Open Annotation use. For example, MITH will be developing a <a title=\"Drupal Content Management System\" href=\"http://drupal.org/\">Drupal</a> plugin that will add video annotation capabilities to any Drupal site. The community will also be developing services for storing and searching annotations.\n\nIf you are interested in the emerging Open Annotation standard, we encourage you to follow <a title=\"Open Annotation community group\" href=\"http://www.w3.org/community/openannotation/\">the W3C community group</a> since OAC has passed the standards development work to the W3C group.\n\nThe video annotation developer’s toolkit is available on Github at <a title=\"video annotation developer's toolkit\" href=\"http://umd-mith.github.com/OACVideoAnnotator/\">http://umd-mith.github.com/OACVideoAnnotator/</a>.",

    "wp post content": "For those of you who aren't familiar, the University of Victoria in beautiful British Columbia holds an annual summer training institute. For five consecutive days over the last ten years, Ray Siemens and digital humanities colleagues and students from around the globe have gathered to learn new skills and network with one another. With 17 classes, a colloquium, and an unconference as well as informal social and professional gatherings, this year's Digital Humanities Summer Institute (<a href=\"http://www.dhsi.org\" target=\"_blank\">DHSI</a>) was a particularly rich encounter for the 432 attendees.\n\nAlong with the <a href=\"http://digital.humanities.ox.ac.uk/dhoxss/\" target=\"_blank\">Digital.Humanities@Oxford Summer School 2012</a> (UK), the <a href=\"http://www.culingtec.uni-leipzig.de/ESU_C_T/node/97\" target=\"_blank\">European \"Culture and Technology\" School</a> at the University of Leipzeig (Germany), and colleagues at the University of Tokyo, I was priveledged to attend DHSI not just as a student but also as a collaborator exploring the potential of networked Digital Humanities Institutes across the globe. Here at MITH, we recently announced that we will serve as the first (but hopefully not only) U.S. iteration of DHSI. The <a href=\"http://www.mith.umd.edu/dhwi/\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Humanities Winter Institute (DHWI)</a> will be held in College Park from January 7 to 11th, 2013 and will feature seven courses, a hack-a-thon, and other Institute events.\n\nDuring the long plane back from Victoria, BC, I caught up on the tremendous number of tweets (over 25,000) and posts from attendees and organizers at this year's DHSI. A few trends and discussions that deserve special mention and some ruminations on where these issues could go:\n\nFor all the statistics that programming is a male dominated environment (see the term \"brogrammer\" for the various incarnations) and that DH is dominated by men, what was quite remarkable at DHSI was the tremendous showing by the female instructors and organizers. These women are highly trained in so many fields (literature, business, computer science, history, new media studies, and librarianship to name a few) and their continued engagement with training the next generation of scholars deserves special mention. I'd love to see more explicit discussion by and about women in DH: who are we? what sort of theoretical/pedagogical/methodological and personal interventions are we making? and how do we create an academic environment that supports and advises the existing and next generation of female scholars?\n<div id=\":ez\">\n\nFrom presenters soliciting for job opportunities to panels about the alt-ac track, an underlying thread of DHSI for many junior scholars was the job market and its future. Professional organizations and news media have made much of digital humanities and its position as the \"savior\" or future of humanities scholarship. Yet for all the celebration about the growing number of digital humanities job opportunities, the number of opportunities remains minimal compared to the large number of students seeking employment. It would be quite useful to consider panels at events like these from scholars who've recently secured employment speaking about the market and their successful navigation of such. It'd also be great to see the digital humanities community begin to provide feedback on the job advertisements that are being put out by academic departments and research centers. Why? A number of scholars noted that digital jobs seems to suffer from a bit of imbalance: they pay lower than traditional academic positions of the same rank but assume more experience with administrative and fundraising matters---something that usually takes years to develop in any scholar's portfolio much less young digital humanists who have recently completed their degrees.\n\nOne other discussion/trend that echoed broadly across the various attendees was concern for their individual project and the resources available to take their project to the next level. Again and again, scholars from institutions lamented that they lacked the resources (technical, personnel, or financial) to move their project along. These scholars spanned the various types of academic institutions---from community colleges to liberal arts to research one universities and everything in between---and experience. Here at MITH, we spend a significant amount of time advising individuals on their projects. I wonder what it would look like if we began to feature a volunteer group of centers/institutions/commons who could provide this service to digital humanities. Would anyone be interested? Could we run a mini-institute that was less about training individuals and more of a matching service/hack-a-thon.I could imagine a project (or projects) being chosen for special development through the week of the Institute. This \"promising\" scholarship could potentially have an army of hundreds focused exclusively on its project. It's be a novel experiment in project development. What exactly could be achieved if dozens or even hundreds worked on a project live?\n\n<em>Jen Guiliano is Assistant Director at MITH</em>.  <em>Look for more posts from MITH staff who attended DHSI later this week!</em>\n\n</div>",

    "wp post content": "Since 2005 MITH's <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/digital-dialogues/\">Digital Dialogues</a> series has served as our signature events program, where we invite members of the digital humanities community to join us to talk about their work. From the beginning it was important for these discussions to serve not just our local community here at the University of Maryland, but also for them to be available to a growing number of scholars interested in the humanities and digital media. As David Durden <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/decade-digital-dialogues-event-recordings-challenges-implementing-retroactive-digital-asset-management-plan/\">discussed</a> <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/the-digital-dialogues-collection-chronicling/\">previously</a> in his posts about curating this collection, Digital Dialogues originally started as an audio podcast, and later migrated to a video format, that we now make available on Vimeo.\n\n\n\nA couple years ago our friend Raymond Yee tweeted to us:\n\n\n\nhttps://twitter.com/rdhyee/status/583734210357141504\n\n\n\nWhile we do have an <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/feed/\">RSS feed for the MITH website</a> we don't actually have a dedicated podcast for Digital Dialogues. Unfortunately a podcast isn't something that Vimeo offers. Sadly it's often not in the interests of social media companies to let you leave their websites and apps to view content. Nevertheless,  Raymond is among the 21% of Americans who still actively listen to podcasts--and according to <a href=\"http://www.edisonresearch.com/the-infinite-dial-2016/\">Edison Research</a> the numbers are growing.\n\n\n\nSo, while we're not getting rid of the video channel we decided to bring back the Digital Dialogues podcast:\n\n\n\n<a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/digital-dialogues/podcast/\"> http://mith.umd.edu/digital-dialogues/podcast/</a>\n\n\n\nDrop that URL in your podcast player or head on <a href=\"itms://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/miths-digital-dialogues/id1200528741?mt=2\">over to the Apple Store</a>:\n\n\n\n<a href=\"itms://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/miths-digital-dialogues/id1200528741?mt=2\"><img class=\" wp-image-18715 aligncenter\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-03-at-1.10.49-PM-300x225.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"484\" height=\"363\" /></a>Registering the podcast with Apple had the handy side effect of pushing it out into the <a href=\"https://itunespartner.apple.com/en/podcasts/partnersearch\">wider podcast ecosystem</a>, so podcast players like <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/\">Overcast </a>should be able to find it.\n\n\n\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-18721 alignleft\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/overcast-169x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"169\" height=\"300\" />\n\n\n\nWe considered modifying our WordPress site to add the video enclosure to our existing RSS feed, but decided instead to make the podcast part of our already existing workflow. Calling it a workflow is really another way of saying that a program runs from cron every day looking for new Digital Dialogue events that have an embedded Vimeo video; if a new one is found the video is downloaded (with <a href=\"https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/\">youtube-dl</a>), the audio is extracted (with <a href=\"http://ffmpeg.org/\">ffmpeg</a>) and then it's published on Amazon S3 (with <a href=\"https://github.com/boto/boto\">boto</a>). You can see this program over in the <a href=\"https://github.com/umd-mith/mithcast\">mithcast repository</a> on GitHub if you are interested.\n\n\n\nWe do hope you enjoy the Digital Dialogues on your commute, on your jog, or wherever they may find you. We're just sorry it took two years Raymond!",

This talk will explore how mimesis might be used as a paradigm from which to explore the relationship between digital surrogates and their analogue counterparts; how familiar terms like object, imitation, copy, original function in the digital realm; and the notion that a digital representation may be more appropriately termed a simulacral identity, reflecting, not the object itself, but our beliefs and conventions about it. This talk will also briefly touch upon mimesis from the viewpoint of digital representations as conscious fashionings of hyper-reality or in Wildean terms, employing the unreal and non-existent to recreate the material world in unexpected, fresh, or subversive ways.\r\r\n\r\r\nSusan Schreibman is Assistant Dean and Head of Digital Collections and Research at University of Maryland Libraries.

Immediately following the talk, the Departments of American Studies, Women’s Studies, and Art will hold a welcome reception at MITH to honor Maryland's recent digital humanities faculty hires: Dr. Hasan Elahi, Dr. Jason Farman, and Dr. Tara Rodgers.\n\n\"Mapping the Mobile Interface: Geolocation Meets Visualization\" by Jason Farman\n\nLandscapes are being transformed into information interfaces. Foundational to our embodied experience of place are the ways in which we represent and visualize space. From crowdsourced maps to urban markup, mobile technologies are intervening in the ways we visualize our interactions with place. Focusing on examples such as the augmented reality applications Street Museum and Twitter 360, the emotion maps in Christian Nold’s Biomapping, and the crowdsourced maps created of Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, this study elaborates on the ways that representations of spaces created with mobile technologies reinstill the integral link between embodied action and the production of space.\n\nJASON FARMAN is Assistant Professor at University of Maryland, College Park in the Department of American Studies. He received his PhD in Performance Studies and Digital Media from the University of California, Los Angeles. Farman’s research includes mobile technologies, social media, videogames, digital storytelling, digital performance art, surveillance, and embodiment. He has published in the journals New Media &amp; Society, Communication Quarterly, and Contemporary Theatre Review. His most recent project is a book manuscript titled Mobile Interface Theory (Routledge, 2011), which investigates the changing conceptions of embodiment and space in pervasive computing culture. This work focuses on the uses of mobile technologies for the creation of performance art, site-specific narrative, and gaming.\n\nView MITH’s complete Fall Speakers Schedule here:\n\n<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20111121205902/http://mith.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_fall_2010.pdf\">http://mith.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_fall_2010.pdf</a>\n\nAll talks free and open to the public!\n\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (<a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu\">http://mith.umd.edu</a>, mith@umd.edu, 5-8927).",

This session has been organized as a mapping party; a social event where a group of mappers and novices descend on an area to map. A brief overview of OSM will be given including its uses in the world before participants organize into small groups and walk a block in College Park. After documenting map features using pen and paper, we'll learn how to import the data into the site using our computers and the OpenStreetMap website. The specifics of what we'll map depends on how much interest there is, but may include map roads/sidewalks/bicycle paths, park benches, house numbers, public bathrooms, handicap accessible ramps, and other points of interest.\n\nGiven time constraints, the mapping party will begin at 12:30pm sharp. No experience is required, and dress comfortably since we'll be walking outside. A laptop will be helpful to enter your data, and participants are encouraged to register an account at openstreetmap.org before the session begins.\n\nMAPPINGDC is a local group organized around producing high quality Free (as in Freedom) maps of Washington, DC and the areas surrounding it. The group meets regularly for social events, including mapping parties. More information can be found on the OpenStreetMap wiki http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/MappingDC, and its Google group http://groups.google.com/group/mappingdc\n\nView MITH’s complete Fall Speakers Schedule here:\n\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20111121205902/http://mith.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_fall_2010.pdf\n\nAll talks free and open to the public!\n\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (http://mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-8927).",

    "wp post content": "Team MARKUP, a group of graduate students working with the <a href=\"http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/\">Shelley-Godwin Archive</a>, evolved as a encoding project in Professor and MITH Director Neil Fraistat's<a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/eng738T\"> Technoromanticism graduate seminar</a> (English 738T) during the Spring 2012 term at the University of Maryland; our team was augmented by several students in<a href=\"http://digital19thcentury.wordpress.com/\"> the sister course</a> taught by Professor Andrew Stauffer at the University of Virginia. The project involved using git and GitHub to manage a collaborative encoding project, practicing TEI and the use of the Oxygen XML editor for markup and validation, and encoding and quality-control checking nearly 100 pages of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein manuscript for the<a href=\"http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/\"> Shelley-Godwin Archive</a>, with each student encoding ten pages of the manuscript.\n\n\n\nTeam MARKUP collaboratively authored <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/eng738T/team-markup-encoding-frankenstein-for-the-shelley-godwin-archive-2/\">a post on the several phases of the project</a> over on the <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/eng738T/\">Technoromanticism blog</a>, so here I’ll address my personal experience of the project.\n\n<h2>Six takeaways from the Team MARKUP project:</h2>\n\n<strong>1. Affective editing is effective editing?</strong> One of my favorite quotations—so beloved that it shapes my professional work and has been reused shamelessly on my Ph.D. exams list, a Society for Textual Scholarship<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20151223202657/http://literaturegeek.com/2012/02/17/society-for-textual-scholarship-panel-abstract/\"> panel abstract</a>, and at least one paper—is Gary Taylor’s reasoning on the meaningfulness of editing: “How can you love a work, if you don't know it? How can you know it, if you can't get near it? How can you get near it, without editors?”*. My interests focus on participatory editing because I want to help others get near the literature I love. Encoding my editorial decisions with TEI pushed me a step closer to the text than my previous non-encoded editorial experience, something I didn’t know was possible.\n\n\n\n[fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=\"yes\" overflow=\"visible\"][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=\"1_1\" background_position=\"left top\" background_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" border_color=\"\" border_style=\"solid\" spacing=\"yes\" background_image=\"\" background_repeat=\"no-repeat\" padding=\"\" margin_top=\"0px\" margin_bottom=\"0px\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_direction=\"left\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" center_content=\"no\" min_height=\"none\"][caption id=\"attachment_8071\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"658\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-8071\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/TEIexample.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot of TEI encoding of first page of volume II of Frankenstein manuscript\" width=\"658\" height=\"146\" /> The Creature speaks! TEI for the first page of the Creature's monologue in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.[/caption]\n\n\n\nMy ten pages happened to be the first pages of the Creature’s monologue; hearing the voice of the Creature by seeing the handwriting of its true creator, Mary Shelley, gave me shivers—meaningful shivers accompanied by a greater understanding of important aspects of Shelley’s writing, such as the large editorial impact made by her husband Percy and the differing ways she crossed out or emphasized changes to her draft. Moving between the manuscripts images and the TEI encoding—so similar to my other work as a web designer and developer—also emphasized the differences in the writing process of my generation and the work that went into inscribing, organizing, and editing a book without the aid of a mechanical or digital device.\n\n\n\n<strong>2. Project management.</strong> Because we didn’t know what to expect from the project until we were in the thick of encoding—would everyone be able to correctly encode ten full pages? how would we control quality across our work? what would our finished pages look like in terms of encoding depth?—we spent most of the project functioning as a large team, which was both sometimes as unwieldy as our large GoogleDoc (trying to find a time when eight busy graduate students can meet outside of class time is difficult!) and sometimes made sense (I was one of the few people on our team comfortable with GitHub and encoding at the start of the project, so I helped with a lot of one-on-one Skype, in-person, and email sessions early on). If I did the project over, I would have held a single Bootcamp day where we all installed and pushed within GitHub and encoded one page of manuscript up on the projector screen, then delegated my role as team organizer by dividing us into three subgroups. I also might have insisted on people agreeing ahead of time on being available for specific in-person meeting times, rather than trying to schedule these one or two weeks beforehand. I do think things worked out pretty well as they did, largely because we had such a great team. Having the GoogleDoc (discussed more below) as a central point for tech how-tos, advice, and questions was also a good choice, though in a larger project I’d probably explore a multi-page option such as a wiki so that information was a) easier to navigate and b) easily made public at the end of our project.\n\n\n\n<strong>3. Changing schemas and encoding as interpretive.</strong> Encoders who started their work early realized that their efforts had good and bad results: because the schema saw frequent updates during our work, those who finished fast needed to repeatedly update their encoding (e.g. a major change was removing the use of &lt;mod type&gt;s). Of course it was frustrating to need to update work we thought was finished—but this was also a great lesson about work with a real digital edition. Not only did the schema changes get across that the schema was a dynamic response to the evolving methodology of the archive, it prepared us for work as encoders outside of a classroom assignment. Finally, seeing the schema as a dynamic entity up for discussion emphasized that even among more seasoned encoders, there are many ways to encode the same issue: encoding, as with all editing, is ultimately interpretative.\n\n\n\n<strong>4. Encode all the things! Or not.</strong> Depth of encoding was a difficult issue to understand early on; once we’d encoded a few pages, I began to have a better sense of what required encoding and what aspects of the manuscript images I could ignore. Initially, I was driven to encode everything, to model what I saw as thoroughly as possible: sums in the margins, different types of overstrikes, and analytical bibliography aspects such as smudges and burns and creases.\n\n\n\n[/fusion_builder_column][fusion_builder_column type=\"1_1\" background_position=\"left top\" background_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" border_color=\"\" border_style=\"solid\" spacing=\"yes\" background_image=\"\" background_repeat=\"no-repeat\" padding=\"\" margin_top=\"0px\" margin_bottom=\"0px\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_direction=\"left\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" center_content=\"no\" min_height=\"none\"][caption id=\"attachment_8072\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"315\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-8072\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/encode.jpg\" alt=\"X all the Y meme stating Encode All the Things\" width=\"315\" height=\"226\" /> Encode all the things... or not. Image created with Quickmeme.[/caption]\n\n\n\nWhat helped me begin to judge what to encode was understanding what was useful for Team MARKUP to encode (the basics that would apply to future encoding work: page structure and additions and deletions), what was useful for more advanced encoders to tackle (sitting in on the SGA staff meetings, I knew that some of our work would be subject to find-and-replace by people more experienced with Percy and Mary’s handwriting styles), and what our final audience would do with our XML (e.g. smudges and burns weren’t important, but Percy’s doodles could indicate an editorial state of mind useful to the literary scholar).\n\n\n\n<strong>5. Editorial pedagogy.</strong> Working on Team MARKUP not only improved my markup skills, it also gave me more experience with teaching various skills related to editions. As I mentioned above, acting as organizer and de facto tech person for the team gave me a chance to write up some documentation on using GitHub and Oxygen for encoding work. I’m developing this content for<a href=\"http://amandavisconti.github.com/markup-pedagogy/\"> this set of GitHub Pages</a> to help other new encoders work with the Shelley-Godwin Archive and other encoding projects. Happily, I was already scheduled to talk about editorial pedagogy at two conferences right after this seminar ends; the Team MARKUP experience will definitely become part of my talks during<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20151223202657/http://literaturegeek.com/2012/02/17/society-for-textual-scholarship-panel-abstract/\"> a panel</a> I organized on embedding editorial pedagogy in editions (Society for Textual Scholarship conference,) and<a href=\"http://www.dhsi.org/events.php\"> a talk</a> on my Choose-Your-Own-Edition editorial pedagogy + games prototype at the Digital Humanities Summer Institute colloquium in Victoria.\n\n\n\n<strong>6. Ideas for future encoding work.</strong> I’ve started to think about ways to encode Frankenstein more deeply; this thinking has taken the form of considering tags that would let me ask questions about the thematics of the manuscript using Python or<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20150312052932/http://hermeneuti.ca:80/voyeur\"> TextVoyeur</a> (aka Voyant); I’m also interested in markup that deals with the analytical bibliography aspects of the text, but need to spend more time with the rest of the manuscript images before I think about those. So far, I’ve come up with five new thematic tagging areas I might explore:\n\n<ul>\n\n\t<li>Attitudes toward monstrosity: A tag that would identify the constellation of related words (monster, monstrous, monstrosity), any mentions of mythical supernatural creatures, metaphorical references to monstrosity (e.g. “his vampiric behavior sucks the energy out of you”), and reactions/attitudes toward the monstrous (with attributes differentiating responses to confronting monstrosity with positive, negative, and neutral attitudes). I could then track these variables as they appear across the novel and look for patterns (e.g. do we see less metaphorical references to monstrosity once a “real” monster is more prevalent in the plot?).</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n\n\t<li>Thinking about doodles: We’re currently marking marginalia doodles with &lt;figure&gt; and a &lt;desc&gt; tag describing the drawing. In our section of the manuscript, many (all?) of these doodles are Percy Shelley’s; I’d like to expand this tag to let me identify and sort these doodles by variables such as complexity (how much thought went into them rather than editing the adjacent text?), sense (do they illustrate the adjacent text?), and commentary (as an extension of sense tagging, does a doodle seem ironically comic given the seriousness or tragedy of the adjacent text?). For someone new to studying Percy’s editorial role, such tagging would help me understand both his editing process and his attitude toward Mary’s writing (reverent? patronizing? distracted? meditative?)</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n\n\t<li>Names, dates, places: These tags would let us create an animated timeline of the novel that shows major characters as they move across a map.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n\n\t<li>Anatomy, whole and in part: To quote from an idea raised in<a href=\"http://www.literaturegeek.com/useful-prosthetics-pretty-metaphors-and-more-on-dh-tools/#more-510\"> an earlier post</a> of mine, I’d add tags that allowed “tracking the incidence of references to different body parts–face, arms, eyes–throughout Frankenstein, and trying to make sense of how these different terms were distributed throughout the novel. In a book concerned with the manufacture of bodies, would a distant reading show us that the placement of references to parts of the body reflected any deeper meanings, e.g. might we see more references to certain areas of the body grouped in areas of the novel with corresponding emphases on the display, observation, and action? A correlation in the frequency and placement of anatomical terms with Frankenstein‘s narrative structure felt unlikely (so unlikely that I haven’t run my test yet, and I’m not saving the idea for a paper!), but if had been lurking in Shelley’s writing choices, TextVoyeur would have made such a technique more visible.”</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<ul>\n\n\t<li>Narrative frames: Tags that identified both the specifics of a current frame (who is the speaker, who is their audience, where are they, how removed in time are they from the events they narrate?) and that frame’s relationship to other frames in the novel (should we be thinking of these words as both narrated by Walton and edited by Victor?) would help create a visualization of the novel’s structure.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\nI expect that playing around with such tags and a distant reading tool would yield even better thinking about encoding methodology than the structural encoding I’ve been working on so far, as the decisions on when to use these tags would be so much more subjective.\n\n\n\n* From \"The Renaissance and the End of Editing\", in <em>Palimpsest: Textual Theory and the Humanities</em>, ed.

Rachel Donahue, doctoral student at the University of Maryland iSchool and research assistant at MITH, recently <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/videogames-as-objects-of-cultural-preservation/\" target=\"_blank\">wrote a post</a> outlining the work of PVW2. As Donahue states, PVW2 focuses on \"what exactly accessing a videogame \"meaningfully\" entails.\"\n\n\n\nWithin the diverse group of research partners, which also includes University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Rochester Institute of Technology, the University of Maryland and Stanford University have partnered to review <em>Harpoon</em>, one of PVW2's several case studies. (Other case studies include <em>Super Mario Bros</em>., <em>Oregon Trail</em>, <em>Civilization</em>, <em>Typing of the Dead</em>). PVW2 has a special emphasis on educational or so-called \"serious\" games. This is where <em>Harpoon</em> comes in: originally created by <a href=\"http://www.larry-bond.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Larry Bond</a> for training naval officers, <em>Harpoon</em> first appeared as a pen and paper tabletop game in 1981; the first version of the computer game was issued eight years later. (Along the way Chris Carlson also joined Bond as a co-designer). In addition to writing games, Bond, a former naval officer, also writes novels. Interestingly enough, Bond got his start working with Tom Clancy; in turn, several of Clancy's best-selling novels are partly based on playing <em>Harpoon</em>.[/fusion_text][fusion_imageframe lightbox=\"yes\" lightbox_image=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_3711xx.jpg\" style_type=\"none\" hover_type=\"none\" bordercolor=\"\" bordersize=\"0px\" borderradius=\"0\" stylecolor=\"\" align=\"center\" link=\"\" linktarget=\"_self\" animation_type=\"0\" animation_direction=\"down\" animation_speed=\"0.1\" animation_offset=\"\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" class=\"\" id=\"\"] <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_3711xx-320x202.jpg\" />[/fusion_imageframe][fusion_separator style_type=\"none\" top_margin=\"10\" bottom_margin=\"10\" sep_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" icon=\"\" icon_circle=\"\" icon_circle_color=\"\" width=\"\" alignment=\"center\" class=\"\" id=\"\"/][fusion_text]Last week, amidst the crisp covers of <em>Harpoon</em> game boxes, displaying submarines and smartly dressed officers peering through their Aviators, Henry Lowood from Stanford University, and Matthew Kirschenbaum and Rachel Donahue from the University of Maryland, combed through boxes of meticulous documentation Bond has loaned to MITH. Henry Lowood, Curator for History of Science &amp; Technology Collections and Film &amp; Media Collections in the Stanford Libraries, and creator of <a href=\"http://www.stanford.edu/group/htgg/cgi-bin/drupal/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How They Got Game</em></a> explains, \"most of the documentation that archives have collected up until now has focused on high-level design documentation, which does not end up being what the game actually is.\"[/fusion_text][fusion_imageframe lightbox=\"no\" lightbox_image=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_3685.jpg\" style_type=\"none\" hover_type=\"none\" bordercolor=\"\" bordersize=\"0px\" borderradius=\"0\" stylecolor=\"\" align=\"center\" link=\"\" linktarget=\"_self\" animation_type=\"0\" animation_direction=\"down\" animation_speed=\"0.1\" animation_offset=\"\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" class=\"\" id=\"\"] <img alt=\"Larry Bond's Notes on the Making of Harpoon\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_3685-320x202.jpg\" />[/fusion_imageframe][fusion_separator style_type=\"none\" top_margin=\"10\" bottom_margin=\"10\" sep_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" icon=\"\" icon_circle=\"\" icon_circle_color=\"\" width=\"\" alignment=\"center\" class=\"\" id=\"\"/][fusion_text]In an effort to dig into the game, the team is navigating through the hundreds of documents, spreadsheets, design sketches, and playtest reports outlining each aspect of the game's creation. Donahue focuses on these game \"manuscripts\" in her personal research. \"Often overlooked, these materials from game developers can provide valuable insight and help build context around the game,\" Donahue says. \"Just as film studies students today might visit the archives of a movie studio, it's easy to imagine future game developers and game scholars learning from the documents generated during game development in addition to the final retail product. \"[/fusion_text][fusion_imageframe lightbox=\"yes\" lightbox_image=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_3674xx.jpg\" style_type=\"none\" hover_type=\"none\" bordercolor=\"\" bordersize=\"0px\" borderradius=\"0\" stylecolor=\"\" align=\"center\" link=\"\" linktarget=\"_self\" animation_type=\"0\" animation_direction=\"down\" animation_speed=\"0.1\" animation_offset=\"\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" class=\"\" id=\"\"] <img alt=\"Harpoon Cover\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_3674xx-200x300.jpg\" />[/fusion_imageframe][fusion_separator style_type=\"none\" top_margin=\"10\" bottom_margin=\"10\" sep_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" icon=\"\" icon_circle=\"\" icon_circle_color=\"\" width=\"\" alignment=\"center\" class=\"\" id=\"\"/][fusion_text]Matthew Kirschenbaum, Associate Director of MITH and a co-principal investigator on the project comments, \"<em>Harpoon</em> is a fascinating case study to work on and Larry Bond's been a terrific help in lending his personal records. It's a game that has had a long history in both tabletop and computer formats, has both a recreational hobbyist following as well as a professional application, and has been used as a tool for plotting best-selling novels. It is without question a significant artifact of its era.\"\n\n\n\nEven though the research of PVW2 is currently from the point of view of game creator, the player perspective equally factors into the research, especially given the researchers also consider themselves players. Lowood explains, \"If we bias the way we're assembling the collection towards one group or another, we bias the research. By taking into account all of these views, we develop several approaches to the collection.\"\n\n\n\nWhile the preservation process of digital games up to now has been mostly ad-hoc, currently there is a huge interest among libraries to build an archive of digital games. By asking what the artifact is, and what aspects of the game must be documented, PVW2 is coming up with a set of best practices for the preservation of digital games for those institutions that seek to archive and collect these significant digital materials.\n\n\n\nIf PVW is categorized as focusing on technical and legal questions, PVW2 may be seen as more theoretical. \"We're trying to get towards the significant aspects of these objects we are preserving, that a repository can monitor, to ensure that the project is saving something worthwhile,\" Lowood says. \"We're stepping back, and asking, what needs to be in this archive of data? And what instructions need to be appended to the data?\"[/fusion_text][fusion_imageframe lightbox=\"yes\" lightbox_image=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_3693.jpg\" style_type=\"none\" hover_type=\"none\" bordercolor=\"\" bordersize=\"0px\" borderradius=\"0\" stylecolor=\"\" align=\"center\" link=\"\" linktarget=\"_self\" animation_type=\"0\" animation_direction=\"down\" animation_speed=\"0.1\" animation_offset=\"\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" class=\"\" id=\"\"] <img alt=\"Kirschenbaum and Lowood Sort Through Bond's Notes\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_3693-300x200.jpg\" />[/fusion_imageframe][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]",

Live theatre, however, is ephemeral. This simple fact creates a tremendous challenge for theatre scholarship and pedagogy. In an effort to compensate for theatre's evanescence, scholars and theatre artists have exploring a variety of techniques to simulate historical theatre events. The key challenge is to reproduce the viewer's immersion in the world of the theatre, and the crucial role that the community of spectators plays in constituting a performance event.\r\r\n\r\r\nI will examine two approaches to simulating live performance using 3D computer animation over the internet. The first is use pre-rendered animations to simulate the experience of watching a performance. The Virtual Vaudeville project exemplifies this approach, letting the viewer switch at will among multiple perspectives on a single nineteenth-century performance. The project also provides a series of hypermedia notes and a real-time flythrough of the theatre. The second approach is to create fully-interactive real-time performances online. I will offer a brief historical overview of such efforts, showing how advances in technology are rapidly making online performance feasible. In particular, I will focus on the tremendous potential -- and serious limitations -- of Second Life as a venue for virtual performance. Moreover, I will argue that the phenomenon of live performance in Second Life raises fundamental questions about very notion of liveness.\r\r\n\r\r\nDAVID Z. SALTZ (PhD, Stanford) is head of the Department of Theatre and Film Studies at the University of Georgia, He currently serves as editor of Theatre Journal. His primary research focus is the interaction between live performance and digital media. He is Principal Investigator of Virtual Vaudeville, a large-scale research project that was funded by the National Science Foundation to simulate a nineteenth century vaudeville performance on the computer. He has also explored the use of computer technology extensively in his work as a director and teacher. Along those lines he established the Interactive Performance Laboratory at UGA, has directed a series of productions incorporating real-time interactive digital media, and has created interactive sculptural installations that have been exhibited nationally. He has published 20 articles in scholarly journals and books, and is coeditor (with David Krasner) of the book Staging Philosophy: Intersections between Theatre, Performance and Philosophy (University of Michigan Press, 2006).\r\r\n\r\r\nComing up @MITH 10/9, Paul E.

    "wp post content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This spring, MITH worked with the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and the University of Maryland Human-Computer Interaction Lab (HCIL) to bring renowned technology scholar Andy van Dam to campus for two successful events.</span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The first, on Monday April 25th, was a screening of a recently-unearthed 1974 documentary made at the end of an NEH-funded grant project van Dam and his team completed to use hypertext to aid in the teaching of poetry. The documentary was discovered after Brett Bobley and Ann Sneesby-Koch from the NEH completed a large-scale project to document all of NEH’s funding history. During that project they uncovered a punch card with details on the grant, which included a reference to a documentary film. Bobley contacted van Dam to enquire about the film, which was recovered and digitally transferred. MITH volunteered to coordinate a panel discussion and screening with van Dam, NEH staff, and UMD faculty members with relevant subject expertise.</span>\n\n\n\n[fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=\"yes\" overflow=\"visible\"][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=\"1_1\" background_position=\"left top\" background_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" border_color=\"\" border_style=\"solid\" spacing=\"yes\" background_image=\"\" background_repeat=\"no-repeat\" padding=\"\" margin_top=\"0px\" margin_bottom=\"0px\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_direction=\"left\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" center_content=\"no\" min_height=\"none\"][caption id=\"attachment_17587\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"473\"]<img class=\"wp-image-17587\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FullSizeRender-2-300x157.jpg\" alt=\"MITH Director Neil Fraistat welcomes a packed crowd at the Monday April 25th panel and screening\" width=\"473\" height=\"247\" /> MITH Director Neil Fraistat welcomes a packed crowd at the Monday April 25th panel and screening[/caption]\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/AndyVanDamHypertextFilm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The film is now available on the Internet Archive for viewing here. </span></a>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/research/computer-science-and-the-humanities/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A recording of the panel discussion and screening is available on our website here.</span></a>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A second event was held the following Tuesday, April 26, and was cosponsored by  the HCIL. In this talk, van Dam discussed modern day collaborations between computing and the humanities in terms of new and old hypermedia projects over the course of five decades. Van Dam’s talk was preceded by a warm welcome by longtime scholarly collaborator and UMD Computer Science professor Ben Shneiderman, and was followed by a lively Q&amp;A session.</span>\n\n\n\n[/fusion_builder_column][fusion_builder_column type=\"1_1\" background_position=\"left top\" background_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" border_color=\"\" border_style=\"solid\" spacing=\"yes\" background_image=\"\" background_repeat=\"no-repeat\" padding=\"\" margin_top=\"0px\" margin_bottom=\"0px\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_direction=\"left\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" center_content=\"no\" min_height=\"none\"][caption id=\"attachment_17588\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"436\"]<img class=\" wp-image-17588\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/FullSizeRender-300x189.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Shneiderman introduces van Dam at the April 26th Digital Dialogue\" width=\"436\" height=\"274\" /> Ben Shneiderman introduces van Dam at the April 26th Digital Dialogue[/caption]\n\n\n\n<a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/dialogues/dd-spring-2016-andy-van-dam/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A recording of Andy’s talk is available here.</span></a>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lastly, Jennifer Howard interviewed van Dam after his talk, and published a fantastic piece on his work and the 1974 grant project in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Humanities Magazine</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. </span><a href=\"http://www.neh.gov/humanities/2016/spring/feature/computers-in-english-class-circa-1974\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Click here to access the piece</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span>[/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]",

    "wp post content": "As a young student at Oxford, <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/theatrefinder/index/fhildy\" target=\"_blank\">Franklin J. Hildy</a>, found himself returning to school after a six-week tour of Europe only to realize that he had often been within proximity of a historic theatre, but had inadvertently bypassed it without knowing it was there. In an effort to provide a comprehensive study to historic theatres where there was none, Hildy, now Professor and Director of Graduate Studies in the <a href=\"http://tdps.umd.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Department of Theatre at the University of Maryland</a>, started collecting information in the early 80s. Yet as his research grew from Greek and Roman theaters, to include Eastern European, North African, and Middle Eastern sites, he found himself restrained by the print medium. Contemporary reference books proved inadequate: the entries were not sufficiently comprehensive, and by the time the book was printed, the material was outdated.\n\n\n\nWith support from a two-year resident fellowship awarded by the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH), Hildy is now providing the comprehensive theatre architecture resource that previously was lacking.\n\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-12738 alignleft\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/theatre-finder-screenshot_sm.png\" alt=\"theatre-finder-screenshot_sm\" width=\"225\" height=\"237\" /> This week marks the launch of <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/theatrefinder/\" target=\"_blank\">Theatre Finder</a>: a collaboratively edited, peer reviewed, online guide to historic theatre architecture over 100 years old, which uniquely incorporates sites from multiple geographic regions over several time periods. Each item page displays a photograph of the theatre (over 100 sites have been photographed by Hildy himself), next to a basic description, related neighboring sites, location, time period, architectural type (Baroque, Hellenistic, Roman etc.), listed aliases, and corresponding Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates. Users who wish to add a theatre to the database, are asked to follow the <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/theatrefinder/index/contribute\" target=\"_blank\">contributor guidelines</a>. Submitted contributions are vetted through an editorial board that reviews the submissions.\n\n\n\nGiven that no universally-accepted, authoritative text exists for theatre architecture, Hildy believes that the peer reviewed nature of Theatre Finder provides a much-needed, rich, and expansive resource. Theatre Finder “opens up new avenues of research, even for those who are familiar with theaters, and have spent years browsing through the existing theatre guides,” Hildy says. Furthermore, Theatre Finder brings attention to historic preservation, by frequently reporting on theatres that are deteriorating or have already disappeared. The problem of maintenance and preservation is often dependent on insufficient funds within local governments. Hildy hopes that by putting this material in an openly-accessible environment, users will visit the theatres in person, and bring attention to the need to maintain these historic sites.\n\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-12708\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/theatre-finder-theatre.png\" alt=\"theatre-finder-theatre\" width=\"225\" height=\"167\" />Theatre Finder includes theatres located in distant locales that were previously unknown or hard to access. Hildy has identified close to 2,000 theatres in China. In order to document this data with accuracy, he is working closely with a professor in China interested in theater preservation to build that portion of the website. Conversely, the project also documents those theatres that were perhaps always under the noses of its inhabitants, tucked away in private castles. “In Italy, there are new theaters from the 17th-18th centuries that are turning up constantly,” Hildy says. “Someone had a theatre in their castle but it had not been open to the public until now.” Likewise, in France, a lift on a previous law that taxed the owner if there was a theatre in the building, has caused more theatres to be reported.\n\n\n\nWorking with the <a href=\"http://www.historictheatres.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Theatre Historical Society of America</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.perspectiv-online.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Association of Historic Theatres in Europe</a>, Hildy is currently building a consortium of institutions to obtain funding for further project development, expand the project data set, and translate the website into various other languages to increase use and accessibility. In its next phase, Theatre Finder will link the GPS coordinates associated with each theatre to Google Earth. Hildy is looking into developing an app that enables both the casual viewer and the scholar to punch the site coordinates into their phone and be directed to the theatre’s geographic position, thus encouraging on-site visits, as well as motivating local governments to preserve these historic gems.\n\n<img class=\"alignright wp-image-12741 size-full\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/theatre-finder-logo.png\" alt=\"theatre-finder-logo\" width=\"225\" height=\"135\" />While traveling to several hundred theatres in twenty five countries over the past thirty years, Hildy has had to jump fences in Greece and Turkey and navigate around sheep in Spain. His passion for performance history comes alive in the presence of the space. Hildy remarks, “The sense of the space and how it structures the relationship the audience can have with the performers is quite palpable...you start to develop [fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=\"yes\" overflow=\"visible\"][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=\"1_1\" background_position=\"left top\" background_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" border_color=\"\" border_style=\"solid\" spacing=\"yes\" background_image=\"\" background_repeat=\"no-repeat\" padding=\"\" margin_top=\"0px\" margin_bottom=\"0px\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_direction=\"left\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" center_content=\"no\" min_height=\"none\"][a sense] of how the architecture structures the way the audience members related to one another.” He admits that in the end, no photograph or digital resource compares with an in-person visit: “When you can see the location of a theatre within, or sometime just outside of, the city it served, you have a whole new appreciation of the theatre in a culture. These are things you can only get from being there. In this regard, Theatre Finder is a gateway to the most exciting kind of experiential learning.”[/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]",

    "wp post content": "MITH is delighted to announce that it has received an award from the 2013 National Endowment for the Humanities Office of Digital Humanities Institutes for Advanced Topics in the Digital Humanities (IATDH) competition for the Building an Accessible Future for Humanities Project and will also serve as a partner in \"O Say Can You See\": Early Washington, D.C. Law and Family Project, led by Will Thomas of the University of Nebraska Lincoln and funded by the Collaborative Research competition.\n\nThe<strong> Building an Accessible Future for the Humanities Project </strong>will facilitate four two-day long workshops where humanists, librarians, information scientists, and cultural heritage professionals can learn about technologies, design standards, and accessibility issues associated with the use of digital technologies. This important project is a partnership with the BrailleSC.org project, the Northeastern University Center for Digital Humanities, the Emory University Libraries Digital Commons (DiSC), the Center for Digital Research in the Humanities (CDRH) at the University of Nebraska (UNL), and the College of Information at the University of Texas at Austin (UT).\n\nWhile scholars who offer courses have been able to turn to their University-level instructional technologies staff for accessibility, scholars who are designing, building, and implementing digital products outside of the classroom (as most humanities-research projects do) have been unable to get the help or guidance that they need. These types of research and the issues of accessibility that they raise with are not the same accessibility issues usually addressed by disability support services offices on university campuses. These campus resources generally concentrate on students and their engagement with course materials (exams and textbooks) or the physical environment (assistive devices). As a result, humanists, librarians, and others looking for assistance in building, designing, and implementing digital projects for assisted users have been largely ignored. Accessible Future will engage those working in digital humanities, information studies, librarianship, and cultural heritage work with resources, training, and a community of people that can assist them with accessibility issues in their own research, training, and teaching.\n\nExact workshop dates as well as enrollment procedures will be announced in early fall 2013 on the MITH website and via Twitter. To aid you in beginning to plan, the tentative schedule will be as follows:\n\n<strong>Workshop 1</strong> will be fall of 2013 at Northeastern University, Boston, MA\n<strong>Workshop 2</strong> will be spring of 2014 at the University of Texas, Austin, TX\n<strong>Workshop 3</strong> will be fall of 2014 at University of Nebraska, Lincoln, NE\n<strong>Workshop 4</strong> will be winter of 2014/early 2015 at Emory University, Atlanta, GA\n\nAccessible Future is led by Assistant Director Jennifer Guiliano (MITH), George Williams and Tina Herzberg (BrailleSC.org) with assistance from workshop hosts Elizabeth Dillon and Ryan Cordell (Northeastern), Tanya Clement (UT), Kay Walter (UNL), Stewart Varner and Brian Croxall (Emory). The team is assisted by: Jeremy Boggs (University of Virginia Scholar’s Lab), James Smith (MITH), Cory Bohon (Independent Developer), Clay Jeffcoat (Access Technology Coordinator for the South Carolina School for the Deaf and the Blind), and Marty R. McKenzie (Principal of the Division of Outreach Services for the South Carolina School for the Deaf and the Blind).\n\n<strong>\"O Say Can You See\": the Early Washington, D.C. Law and Family Project</strong> explores multi-generational black and white family networks in early Washington, D.C., by collecting, digitizing, making accessible, and analyzing over 4,000 case files from the D.C. court from 1808 to 1815, records of Md. courts, and related documents about these families. Scholars from the University of Maryland and the University of Nebraska will collaborate by uncovering the web of litigants, jurists, legal actors, and participants in this community, and by placing these family networks in the foreground of our interpretive framework of slavery and national formation. Focusing first on the landmark 1813 case Queen v. Hepburn, the only petition for freedom from slavery heard by the U.S. Supreme Court, and a foundational case establishing the hearsay rule, the project will document the relationships within and among black and white families in early D.C. at the center of these cases, host virtual seminars to refine our methods, and produce a series of studies in monograph and article form. The Nebraska team is led by Will Thomas, Chair, Department of History and John and Catherine Angle Professor in the Humanities and Professor of History. The Maryland team is jointly led by Jennifer Guiliano, Assistant Director of MITH, and Trevor Muñoz, Associate Director of MITH and Assistant Dean of the University of Maryland Libraries.",

How can we provide robust, large-scale TEI publication services, while accommodating the detailed scholarly insight that makes TEI such a valuable tool for the digital humanities? What level of customization and variation can we support without compromising on interoperability, and what are the mechanisms by which we can achieve the optimal balance? And who needs variation anyway--what kinds of scholarly insight are at stake, or at risk?\n\n\n\nTAPAS seeks to offer long-term TEI repository and publishing services, with special focus on supporting scholars who lack access to XML publishing infrastructure or expertise at their own institutions. Supported by a planning grant from the IMLS and now by a two-year IMLS National Leadership Grant and an NEH Digital Humanities Startup Grant, the TAPAS service will make it possible for scholars to use TEI in their teaching and research without mastering the full suite of XML technologies. The service will also provide access to consulting, training, documentation, and community-developed tools. This talk will explore the conceptual and strategic challenges in developing TAPAS, and in particular the problem of how to harmonize--or transcend--divergent approaches to TEI encoding.\n\n\n\nThis talk will be held in 2115 Tawes Hall.\n\n\n\nJulia Flanders is the Director of the Women Writers Project,  part of the Center for Digital Scholarship in the Brown University Library. She is also editor-in-chief of Digital Humanities Quarterly, an online, peer-reviewed, open-access journal of digital humanities, and has served in a variety of positions within the Text Encoding Initiative, the Association for Computers and the Humanities, centerNet, and the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations. Her research focuses on text encoding, digital methods of scholarly communication, and the politics of labor in the digital academy.\n\n\n\nA continuously updated schedule of talks is also available on the Digital Dialogues webpage.\n\n\n\nUnable to attend the events in person? Archived podcasts can be found on the MITH website, and you can follow our Digital Dialogues Twitter account <a href=\"//twitter.com/digdialog\" target=\"_blank\">@digdialog</a> as well as the Twitter hashtag #mithdd to keep up with live tweets from our sessions.\n\n\n\nAll talks free and open to the public. Attendees are welcome to bring their own lunches.",

Users can collaboratively tag a text in TEI, associate XML with time stamps in video or audio files, and mark off regions of an image to be linked to external metadata. With an intuitive, web-based interface, AXE makes the process of preparing online digital editions and archives more efficient and accurate. AXE also facilitates collaboration in the digital humanities by permitting multiple scholars to work on the same document or archive at the same time from various locations, and will track all work so that variant versions can be collated and all versions can be archived. The Ajax XML encoder, with its intuitive Web-based interface, will come as a breath of fresh air to those who have previously been frustrated by text-centric tagging tools which require an expert knowledge of mark-up languages.\r\r\n\r\r\nDOUG RESIDE is the Assistant Director of the Maryland Institute of Technology in the Humanities (MITH) and a Visiting Assistant Professor of Theater at the University of Maryland in College Park. Doug holds undergraduate degrees in Computer Science and English and earned his PhD in English at the University of Kentucky where he worked on several digital humanities projects, including Kevin Kiernan's celebrated Electronic Boethius. Doug's primary research interest is musical theater and the way in which digital technology can be used both to create and to preserve the art form. In addition to his managerial, and programming work at MITH, Doug is currently working on a book on the \"born-digital\" musical.\r\r\n\r\r\nComing up @MITH 9/16: Stan Katz, \"Digital Humanities 3.0: Where We Have Come From and Where We Are Now?\"\r\r\n\r\r\nWatch for MITH's complete Digital Dialogues schedule available soon!\r\r\n\r\r\nAll talks free and open to the public!\r\r\n\r\r\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-8927).",

We especially encourage submissions from independent scholars and scholars associated with academic institutions. Posters may include a demonstration, traditional printed poster, or a combination of both. Wireless internet access will be available at the poster venue.\r\n\r\nShort abstracts (250-500 words) should be submitted to Neil Fraistat at fraistat@umd.edu by 6 p.m. on February 25, 2008. The proposals will be reviewed by the planning committee and successful applicants will be notified by March 10, 2008. The poster session will take place on the afternoon of May 3, 2008.\r\n\r\nThis conference will address the increasing centrality of digitization to the archiving of materials, as well as the growth of digital technology in the teaching, scholarship and artistic production in the field of African American/African Diaspora Studies. The conference is a collaboration involving the African American/African Diaspora Area Group of the English Department, the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH), and the School of Architecture, Planning &amp; Preservation, as well as other faculty and students from the College of Arts and Humanities (ARHU) and the College of Behavioral and Social Sciences (BSOS).\r\n\r\nThe conference, the first of its kind, will bring together approximately 150 national and international scholars, high school and middle school teachers, artists, students and attendees to discuss a growing body of work that has not as yet benefited from an organized forum that would allow practitioners to meet one another not only to discuss on-going projects, but also to debate the theoretical, methodological, and pedagogical issues raised by the intersection of the fields of Digital Humanities and African American/African Diaspora Studies. As the field of African American/African Diaspora Studies can benefit from a thoughtful consideration of the application of new media tools, so, too, can the field of digital humanities benefit from a focused discussion of scholarship informed by critical race studies.\r\n\r\nThe program will begin on May 1st and 2nd with hands-on workshops, including one sponsored by the TEI Consortium and funded by the NEH, which will provide a practical introduction to text encoding and another that will focus on navigating online resources in African American and African Diaspora Studies. The workshops will be followed by a panel showcasing work by scholars in the field of African American/African Diaspora Studies that address and/or make use of digital technologies and new media. The chair and the respondents will be University of Maryland graduate students. The keynote address by Abdul Alkalimat (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) will be followed by a reception and the presentation of a multi-media art installation. The last day will be taken up by panels and seminars, one of which will be geared toward middle and high school teachers; digital \"poster\" sessions, using laptops, to introduce projects by students, faculty and independent scholars; and a closing multi-media performance. Confirmed participants include Abdul Alkalimat, Howard Dodson, Anna Everett, Jerome Handler, Paul D. Miller (AKA DJ Spooky), Alexander Weheliye, and Pamela Z.",

Development will be overseen by  Doug Reside, Visiting Assistant Professor of Theatre and Assistant Director of the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities, and Frank Hildy, Professor of Theatre. This the fourth Digital Humanities Startup for MITH in two years.\n\nAs the name suggests, this tool is an open source, collaborative, 3d modeler that will allow users with very little experience to generate a 3-dimensional model in their web browser which they can then allow other users to both view and edit.  The tool will initially be used to construct an international database of pre-19th century theater buildings, but will be intentionally generic so that scholars interested in structures of any sort can easily port it into their own projects.  CAMP will initially be used as a component in the Comprehensive World Wide Digital Archive of Existing Historic Theatres-- a collaboratively edited, peer reviewed, online database of historic theatre architecture from the Minoan \"theatrical areas\" on the island of Crete, to the last theatre built before 1815. The Comprehensive World Wide Archive of Existing Historic Theatres is an attempt to create the necessary finding aid for these buildings and provide a consistent body of relevant data, most especially digital reconstructions at a consistent scale, about them.",

Bly's generous donation includes a rich archive of materials from the early literary hypertext movement, and joins the existing <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/larsen/\" target=\"_blank\">Deena Larsen Collection</a> also housed at MITH. Together, these two collections position MITH as a major center of study for anyone interested in primary source materials--both manuscript and born-digital--from this unique moment in literary and technological history.[/fusion_text][fusion_text]\"The materials are from the incunabulum period of electronic literature,\" says Bly. \"Not only are the texts significant—some of which will disappear—but it is difficult to get at what the author intended without the original hardware.\" Bly's collection includes numerous exemplars of hypertext fiction and poetry collected over the years, as well as his own notes and variations for <em>We Descend</em>, his ongoing hyper-fiction, the first volume of which was published by <a href=\"http://www.eastgate.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Eastgate Systems</a> in 1997. The collection is particularly rich in materials related to the early Macintosh software HyperCard, used as the platform for dozens of works of early electronic literature.\n\n\n\nNotably, the protagonist of <em>We Descend</em> is an archivist. Bly notes that now, \"the archive [is] needing to be archived--anticipating it's own demise and rescue. The archivist is retrieving past lives, constantly having to deal with the degeneration of media. Everyone is dealing with the transmission of the story. The archivist exists on a personal level as opposed to the institutional level, that is, the institutions that sponsor archives but also impose order on them.\"[/fusion_text][fusion_imageframe lightbox=\"yes\" lightbox_image=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_2698_BB.jpg\" style_type=\"none\" hover_type=\"none\" bordercolor=\"\" bordersize=\"0px\" borderradius=\"0\" stylecolor=\"\" align=\"right\" link=\"\" linktarget=\"_self\" animation_type=\"0\" animation_direction=\"down\" animation_speed=\"0.1\" animation_offset=\"\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" class=\"\" id=\"\"] <img src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_2698_BB-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Bly and Matthew Kirschenbaum Sort Through Bly's Collection\" />[/fusion_imageframe][fusion_text]The hypertext experiment originated in the 1980s as a small, closely-knit group of literature enthusiasts, authors, critics, and software developers. Michael Joyce is credited with authoring the first literary hypertext, <em>Afternoon, a story</em>, published by Eastgate in 1990 (though written several years earlier). Bly became hooked on hypertexts after taking \"Hypertext Poetry &amp; Fiction\" through The New School in New York City. \"In one's mind, text exists differently than the linear structure on the page,\" says Bly. \"Hypertext is the closest thing we have to a mental structure.\"\n\n\n\nSpeaking fondly, Bly describes the social history of the early hypertext movement, and its tightly knit community. The original culture has changed since hypertexts started migrating to the Web during the early 1990s. Associate Director of MITH Matthew Kirschenbaum remarks, \"Hypertext was originally about new forms of narrative story-telling; what is happening on the Web these days often tends to be more visual and cinematic.\" Several of the original Eastgate hypertexts are now being reworked for release on the Apple iPad.[/fusion_text][fusion_imageframe lightbox=\"no\" lightbox_image=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_2686_Bly.jpg\" style_type=\"none\" hover_type=\"none\" bordercolor=\"\" bordersize=\"0px\" borderradius=\"0\" stylecolor=\"\" align=\"right\" link=\"\" linktarget=\"_self\" animation_type=\"0\" animation_direction=\"down\" animation_speed=\"0.1\" animation_offset=\"\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" class=\"\" id=\"\"] <img src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/IMG_2686_Bly-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Bly Shares an Early Hypertext\" />[/fusion_imageframe][fusion_text]Bly is currently completing <em><a href=\"http://www.wedescend.com/\" target=\"_blank\">We Descend, Volume Two</a>.</em> He will be presenting a live demo of the work November 19-20 at <a href=\"http://www.eastgate.com/DangerousReadings/\" target=\"_blank\">Dangerous Readings</a> in Watertown, MA.\n\n\n\n\"As with the Deena Larsen Collection,\" Kirschenbaum says, \"we at MITH see Bill's gift as a <em>living archive</em>, to be accessed, explored, and enjoyed as openly as possible by students and researchers. We will be working to catalog and describe the materials, and we welcome anyone with an interest in exploring the history of hypertext to contact us about a visit.\"[/fusion_text][/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]",

    "wp post content": "Tuesday, April 26, 12:30-1:45PM\nMITH Conference Room, McKeldin Library B0135\n\n\"Diggable Data, Scalable Reading, and New Humanities Scholarship\" by NEIL FRAISTAT &amp; SETH DENBO\n\nIn his 2005 book, Franco Moretti aims to open “a new front of discussion” by calling for a \"distant reading\" of texts in the pursuit of literary history. Abstraction in the form of the <em>Graphs, Maps and Trees </em>of the book’s title, he argues, reduces the number of elements in focus, providing a “sharper sense of their overall interconnection.” Moretti’s call is being been taken up by scholars working in a digital milieu, though not without controversy.\n\nWith mass digitization of print culture the potential for new types of investigation into the human condition is enormous, but just as scholars have always required a network of libraries and archives to support their use of books, manuscripts and other textual resources, digital resources require an infrastructure for discovery, study, and maintenance. Partnerships between research libraries, IT departments, and digital humanities centers have developed to support digitally enhanced scholarship in the arts and humanities. Internationally, in recent years several large-scale projects have been funded within the humanities and social sciences, to provide infrastructure to support the new digital scholarship. The University of Maryland is currently partnering with 9 other universities on one such international effort: the Mellon-funded <a href=\"http://www.projectbamboo.org\">Project Bamboo</a>, which is attempting to answer the question: “How can we advance arts and humanities research through the development of shared technology services?”\n\nIn this presentation and the ensuing discussion, we aim to present and contextualize our work on Project Bamboo in light of new modes of humanities digital scholarship and reading, including text mining and corpora analysis. Utilizing the high profile <a href=\"http://ngrams.googlelabs.com\">Google Books Ngram Viewer</a> project and reactions to the “<a href=\"http://www.culturomics.org/\">culturomics</a>” approach as examples of the benefits and pitfalls of textual analysis at scale, we will argue for a scalable approach to humanities research, simultaneously distant and close, where for each step of abstraction away, the scholar can step back into the detail of the text.\n\nNEIL FRAISTAT is Professor of English and Director of the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) at the University of Maryland. He is a founder and general editor of the <em>Romantic Circles </em>Website, the Co-Chair of centerNet, an international network of digital humanities centers, and has published widely on the subjects of Romanticism, Textual Studies, and Digital Humanities in various articles and in the eight books he has authored or edited. He is currently seeing through the press Volume III of <em>The Complete Poetry of Percy Bysshe Shelley</em> and the <em>Cambridge Companion to Textual Scholarship</em>.  Fraistat has been awarded the Society for Textual Scholarship’s biennial Fredson Bowers Memorial Prize, the Keats-Shelley Association Prize, honorable mention for the Modern Language Association’s biennial Distinguished Scholarly Edition Prize, and the Keats-Shelly Association’s Distinguished Scholar Award.\n\nSETH DENBO is Project Coordinator for Bamboo Corpora Space at MITH. He holds a PhD in history from the University of Warwick in the United Kingdom and is a cultural historian of eighteenth-century England. Before coming to MITH he has worked on projects in digital history, the AHRC ICT Programme in Arts and Humanities and been Research Associate at King’s College London where he was involved in strategic planning for a major European digital research infrastructure. He is also convenor of a new seminar in digital history at the Institute for Historical Research.\n\nA continuously updated schedule of talks is also available on the <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/podcast/\"><strong>Digital Dialogues webpage</strong></a>.\n\nUnable to attend the events in person? Archived podcasts can be found on the MITH website, and you can follow our Digital Dialogues Twitter account <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/digdialog\"><strong>@digdialog</strong></a> as well as the Twitter hashtag #mithdd to keep up with live tweets from our sessions.\n\nAll talks free and open to the public!

One of the most salient outcomes of the workshop is a <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/offthetracks/recommendations/\">Collaborators' Bill of Rights</a>.\n\nIn the afternoon of the last day of the workshop, the participants divided into four subgroups tasked with discussing models for institutional support, models for career paths, models for collaboration, and models for transformation. This initial draft was written by the “collaboration team” which includes Matthew Kirschenbaum, Bethany Nowviskie, Tom Scheinfeldt, and Doug Reside. They posted <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/offthetracks/recommendations/\">a very rough draft</a> just hours later in the hopes that it would provoke further discussion by the larger community. The larger community has responded with <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/offthetracks/recommendations/\">poignant comments</a> and on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#trx4hx\">Twitter</a>. The hashtag for the event was #trx4hx.\n\nThe entire draft of recommendations are forthcoming.",

Jackson is an internationally recognized writer, electronic artist, and theorist and practitioner of new performance media. Her work includes <i><a href=\"http://www.eastgate.com/catalog/PatchworkGirl.html\">Patchwork Girl</a></i> (published in 1995 by Eastgate Systems, it is a hypertext refashioning of <i>Frankenstein</i>, told--in part--from the vantage point of the female monster). \"Perhaps the true paradigmatic work of the era,\" writes Robert Coover, \"Shelley Jackson's elegantly designed, beautifully composed <em>Patchwork Girl</em> offers the patient reader, if there are any left in the world, just such an experience of losing oneself to a text, for as one plunges deeper and deeper into one's own personal exploration of the relations here of creator to created and of body to text, one never fails to be rewarded and so is drawn ever deeper, until clicking the mouse is as unconscious an act as turning a page, and much less constraining, more compelling.\" More recently, Jackson has gained notoriety for \"<a href=\"http://ineradicablestain.com/skin.html\">Skin</a>,\" a short story \"published\" as individual words tattooed onto the skin of hundreds of willing participants. She has written experimental Web-based texts, including \"My Body--a Wunderkammer\" (available at <a href=\"http://www.altx.com/thebody/\">http://www.altx.com/thebody/</a>) and \"Stitch Bitch\" (<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20161028054228/http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/papers/jackson.html\">http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/papers/jackson.html</a>).

Using project case studies from a decade of experience in this field, the presentation brings to the fore the ways in which these technologies both enforce and challenge traditional ideas of what a museum is or should be. The paper examines the evolution of simple virtual representation to modeled reconstruction and deconstruction and thence to virtual replacement of artifacts in situ at their point of creation or discovery. The presentation concludes with a look forward to the concept of massively multi-user virtual community spaces that permit a participatory experience of virtual cultural heritage.\r\r\n\r\r\nJOHN TOLVA is Senior Program Manager for Cultural Strategy and Programs for IBM. His work spans the fields of web design, user-centric solution design, cultural heritage, and new media. Since his work on the award-winning Hermitage Museum project in 1999 Mr. Tolva has primarily been involved in cultural applications of technology, particularly digitization, content management, and multimedia design. Recently he led the team that launched the Eternal Egypt Project, a partnership between IBM and the Egyptian Government. Mr. Tolva holds a Masters in Information Design and Technology from the Georgia Institute of Technology and a Masters in English Literature from Washington University. John is on the editorial board of the ACM Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage. He maintains a blog at www.ascentstage.com.\r\r\n\r\r\nComing up @MITH 10/2, David Saltz (University of Georgia): \"Simulating Liveness: From Virtual Vaudeville to Second Life\"\r\r\n\r\r\nView MITH's complete Fall Speakers Schedule <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100615144449/http://www.mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_fall_2007.pdf\">here</a>.\r\r\n\r\r\nAll talks free and open to the public!\r\r\n\r\r\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-8927).[/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]",

    "wp post content": "<div>\n\nThis will be one of my last blog entries prior to the launch of the<em> Black Gotham Digital Archive</em> so it seems like an appropriate moment for me to step back and take stock of all things Black Gotham.\n\n<strong>Looking back. </strong>By my count, since the publication of <em>Black Gotham</em> in February 2011 I’ve given some forty-five book talks with three more scheduled for this spring. I’ve spoken in venues as varied as bookstores, museums, historical societies, libraries, academic conferences, college campuses, genealogical societies, churches, and in front of audiences as diverse as scholars in the field, the general public, genealogists, and students from junior high to college. If you’ve missed any of these talks, you can always catch them on <a href=\"http://bit.ly/J5l23W\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube</a>.\n\nIn addition, I’ve given several radio interviews ranging from NPR’s Leonard Lopate show in New York to black talk radio covering all regions of the country—Dallas in the South, Madison in the Midwest, California and Oregon in the far West.  I’ve even done some interviews for local New York TV, interviewed by some of my favorite media guys, Sam Roberts at NYC Channel 1 and Brian Lehrer at CUNY TV, Channel 75.  I must say I never seem to tire of talking about <em>Black Gotham</em>!\n\nBeyond talking about the book, I’ve also continued writing about it.  I did two essays for the New York Times online series about the Civil War (“<a href=\"http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/19/dr-smiths-back-room/\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Smith’s Back Room</a>” and “<a href=\"http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/30/what-were-the-women-doing/\" target=\"_blank\">What Were the Women Doing?</a>“) as well as a <a href=\"http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/category/taking-questions/\" target=\"_blank\">Q &amp; A for the New York Times online “City Room.”</a> All these pieces build upon ideas first broached in the book.\n\nFinally, look out for the forthcoming NEH Humanities Magazine.  You’ll find another Q &amp; A in it.\n\nAll this work has been well worth it since Black Gotham has just won the <a href=\"http://www.nysoclib.org/awards/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">2011 New York Society Library Award for History</a>!\n\n<strong>Looking forward.</strong> The <em>Black Gotham Digital Archive</em> launch is scheduled for May 20! That date is just around the corner but I feel there’s still so much left to do. <a href=\"http://omeka.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Omeka</a> is a lot trickier that it first appears. You can’t imagine how much work goes into creating a website that’s user-friendly. Behind every clickable icon, image, word there’s an enormous amount of trial and error going on.\n\nI won’t give too much away, just enough to whet your appetite. I hope to have five exhibits to show: the first introduces users to my family; the second tours a few early Lower Manhattan places; the third invites users into two African Free Schools of the 1820s and 1830s; the fourth portrays members of the black elite at mid-century; and the fifth examines the fate of family members and their friends during the draft riots. You’ll find a lot more images in these digital exhibits than in the book as well as links to select archival documents where the nineteenth-century voice leaps at you right off the page and links to primary and secondary source books that are now online. With the digital archive, you won’t have to check the index and then shuffle back and forth among pages spread far apart. Just click and you’ll get a new item and information about it.  Enjoy!\n\n<em>Carla L. Peterson is professor of English at the University of Maryland.

The GSO plays classical arrangements of music and scores from popular video games; no tinny Pac-Man Fever jingles here, rather music that brings to life the richness and breadth of the complex auditory soundscapes surrounding contemporary games like Halo, World of Warcraft, and Final Fantasy.\r\n\r\nThe GSO is composed of students from UMD as well as the surrounding community. Join us for a discussion and samples of their unique performances with music director CHRIS APPLE, conductor and arranger GREG COX, and president JARRED YOUNG.\r\n\r\nFor more information, including photos and recordings of their music, visit the GSO at http://umd.gamersymphony.org/.\r\n\r\nComing up @MITH: 2/19, there is no talk. 2/26, Doug Eyman (George Mason), \"Play and Pedagogy: An Ecological Framework for Teaching Writing with Video Games.\"\r\n\r\nView MITH's complete spring Digital Dialogues schedule: http://www.mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_spring_2008.pdf\r\n\r\nAll talks free and open to the public!\r\n\r\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-8927).",

    "wp post content": "I ended my last blog entry with the suggestion that one possible virtue of virtuality might be that a digital archive inverts the book's relationship between word and image (in the case of <em>Black Gotham</em>, portraits of people as well as depictions of places—maps, streets, buildings, etc.).  \"In my book,\" I wrote, \"word was the primary vehicle for telling my story and image functioned as supporting illustration; in the digital archive, image is the primary vehicle and word supporting document.\"\n\nI'm well aware, however, that much like a printed book a digital archive must create and sustain a narrative arc—consisting not only of a beginning, middle, and end, but also of a certain narrative tension that impels the viewer forward to look, search, discover.  But unlike a book (at least unlike the case of <em>Black Gotham</em> where Yale University Press was incredibly generous in the number of pages it allotted to me) a digital archive seems to demand greater concision and focus.  It seems to be a question of how to get more out of less.\n\nHow then does a person of the word like me create a narrative out of images?  At our last MITH meeting, Seth suggested that I might think in terms of organizing my archive by chapters.  But the very term chapter now strikes me as too bookish, so I've begun to think more in terms of stories, maybe even episodes, each of which forms what I'm calling a \"cluster.\"\n\nSo far, I've identified about eighteen clusters.  I envision that each one will start with a \"portal,\" a doorway through which the viewer enters.  In the first cluster, the portal will be my family tree: viewers will be able to click on names of family members and meet them through photographs, obituaries, personal commentary, and the like.  The portals of the remaining clusters will be maps that foreground place.  By means of clickable icons, they<em> </em>will pinpoint, and allow the viewer entry into, the many sites—neighborhoods, streets, buildings—that anchor my story.  A first map will introduce nineteenth-century Gotham—its commercial areas, ports, fashionable neighborhoods of the white elite, as well as areas inhabited by poorer folk, whether black, native born whites, Irish or German immigrants.  Later maps will highlight specific sites of particular significance to the black community—churches, schools, institutions—or to individuals—home, work places, etc.—and tell their stories.\n\nBut in and of themselves the clusters don't really create narrative tension.  So how can I organize them to create a narrative that will pull viewers in and stimulate their interest?  I'm thinking that one technique might be that of contrast: for example, the introductory map would be organized around the contrast of wealthy neighborhoods of the white elite to the downtrodden areas that were home to black New Yorkers and lower class whites.\n\nAnother technique could be what I call \"point-counterpoint\" that illustrates how every step forward taken by the black elite was met with resistance by white New Yorkers, forcing them to take at least half a step back.  Proceeding chronologically, I would show how black leaders of the 1820s, '30s, and '40s struggled to form a cohesive community by establishing schools and other kinds of institutions, but were consistently opposed by white racists for whom mob violence was often the weapon of choice (the African Grove theater riot in the early 1820s, the 1834 Chatham Street Chapel riot).  At the same time, I would juxtapose black New Yorkers' sense of themselves—their hopes and aspirations—during these decades against the views of British visitors like Mrs. Felton, Mrs. Trollope, and Charles Dickens, who wrote about the city's black population from the ignorant, negative perspective of an outsider.  I would also point out how such a juxtaposition is replicated in the 1850s as the rise of black entrepreneurship in the city was met with similar hostile and derogatory reactions from American writers William Bobo, George Foster, and others.  My archive's narrative arc reaches its zenith (or maybe I should say its nadir) with the draft riots of July 1863 during which white mobs set out to destroy everything black New Yorkers had so painstakingly tried to build.\n\nBut I'm getting ahead of myself.  I first need to get back to Omeka, create my clusters and enter my data and metadata.\n\n<em>editor's note: Carla L.

    "wp post content": "<i>This is the second in <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/tag/transgender-usenet-archive/\" target=\"_blank\">series of blog posts</a> by 2016-17 Winnemore Digital Dissertation Fellow Avery Dame on the progress of his dissertation, “<a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/?p=18022\" target=\"_blank\">Talk Amongst Yourselves: Community Formation in Transgender Counterpublic Discourse Online</a>,” which explores the affective and structural meanings assigned to “community” in English-language transgender discourse online.</i>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One of the biggest challenges of working with Usenet Collections is their sheer size. For my five newsgroup collections, the average message count is between roughly 50,000 to 100,000 per collection. (To place that in context to recent news stories, presidential candidate HIllary Clinton’s private email server held </span><a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2016/07/a-guide-to-clintons-emails/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">62,320 total emails</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.) Though it’s not too sizable in storage terms (all five collections add up to about 1 GB total), it’s definitely a lot of data for a close discourse analysis. Complicating the process further is that many of the messages held in these collections also aren’t relevant to my specific research questions. That’s also a lot of information to hold in a single location, particularly as an archive. Unlike the </span><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/usenethistorical\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">anonymous “generous donor”</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> who initially collected all of the various newsgroup messages, I’ll be making deliberate, intentional choices regarding what to include, how to present the messages, and what information should be indexed. Given this, I’ve moved to using the term “collections” to describe the data as it is now.</span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I’ve also been slowing my pace a bit in order to think carefully about what the archive might look like. Recently, I’ve focused my energy on spending a lot of time with the data, in order to get a better sense of how it should be structured, the technical challenges I might face, and what ethical questions I should consider. Part of this process has been doing a lot of scraping, counting, and visualizing, in order to put my numbers in (some) perspective. Now, these aren’t perfect tools, but I have been able to identify the active posters, cross-posting habits, and a rough network of posts using “cisgender” and variants of the term.</span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I’ve put </span><a href=\"http://averydame.net/?page_id=495\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">all of these visualizations up on my site</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, with some description about their significance and my collection methodology (with links to the modules on </span><a href=\"https://github.com/apdame/usenet-tools\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">GitHub</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">). From these exercises, I’ve learned that these newsgroups were similar to non-transgender newsgroups in poster activity, with a small handful of highly active posters who make up a sizable chunk of the messages collected. Users primarily posted to one or two newsgroups at a time, and there are some interesting differences in both what's recorded in the collections and how users cross-posted. There’s not a lot of crossposting between the two newsgroups with “transgendered” in the name, alt.transgendered (AltT) and soc.support.transgendered (SST), but there is a lot of cross-posting between SST and alt.support.srs (SRS). In contrast, the two major crossdressing groups, alt.fashion.crossdressing (AFCD) and alt.support.crossdressing (ASCD) have almost equal patterns of single newsgroup posting and cross-posting between themselves. These differences raise interesting questions I hope to address in a close analysis using the archive, once it’s launched in the next few weeks.</span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-18093\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CisNet-980x648.png\" alt=\"Cisgender Usenet Visualization\" width=\"603\" height=\"399\" /></span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">However, I also wanted to spend a little more time talking about </span><a href=\"http://averydame.net/network/#\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">my initial network analysis</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, because I think it’s indicative of some of complexities of working with Usenet data. One of my key research questions is how Usenet facilitated the spread of the term “cisgender.” As far as I’ve found, the term or its variants don’t appear in movement publications during the 1990s. However, it eventually became ubiquitous in transgender discourse. How could that be, if it wasn’t in active use in print publications? This takes me to the internet, the other major (recorded) hub of transgender discussion at the time.</span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The term’s origins are unclear, and its corresponding Wikipedia (the unofficial arbiter of its history) reflects this lack of clarity. The page </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cisgender&amp;oldid=83262833\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">did at one point cite</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> two Usenet users, Carl Bujis posting in soc.support.transgendered in 1996 and Dana Leland Defosse, posting in alt.transgendered in 1994, as separately originating the term.<sup>1</sup> However, </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Cisgender/Archive_1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">the validity of these claims were challenged</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> as not being from “reliable sources” and subsequently removed. Usenet connections are made elsewhere as well: In the official Oxford English Dictionary (OED) definition, </span><a href=\"http://www.oed.com.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu/view/Entry/35015487?redirectedFrom=cisgender#eid\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">the earliest use example cited is from Usenet</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. For my research, I’m not particularly interested in finding a definitive origin point, but I am curious about what might have facilitated the sudden increase in use.</span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This leads me back to Usenet. </span><a href=\"http://averydame.net/?p=518\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As I noted in my post contextualizing Usenet</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, part of why spam was such an issue was how (relatively) easy it was to post and cross-post to multiple groups. This meant posts could spread widely and possibly be seen by a sizeable audience. Curious about how widespread the term was in the collected I collected information on all posts (identified by their unique Message ID) that used the term and its variants (cisgendered, cis-gender, cis-gendered, and cis), and the posts referenced in the “References” header (or previous posts in the conversation).<sup>2</sup> The References header is by no means a perfect tool, though.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400\">According to </span><a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1036\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">the documentation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, the References header in Usenet messages was supposed to “allow messages to be grouped into conversations by the user interface program.” However, programs were required to include only “a reasonable number of backwards references” if the list got too long. Thus, not all of a conversation was recorded in the header. Furthermore, some messages weren’t collected at the poster’s request, so their trace exists in a unique Message ID with no data.</span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Nevertheless, </span><a href=\"http://averydame.net/network/#\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">the network I built</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> (visualized using the OpenOrd layout) gives you an idea of the amount, activity level, and connections between posts. Each node is a unique posting. Nodes are sized and colored according to their degree of connection to other nodes, and labeled using their Message ID. Posts with just a Message ID and no extra information (original/reply, year, etc.) were not held in any of the collections.</span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What does this show? Firstly, that the term appeared frequently on Usenet in several venues: ASCD and SST. I’ve specifically chosen appeared instead of “used” because Usenet posters often quoted each other using big chunks of one another’s text. So, a term could appear in many posts, but only in quotes and not by the individual poster. So the term gains visibility even if it isn’t adopted by others. Furthermore, big numbers don’t always equal long threads (as far as the collections show). While several posts sparked a high level of conversation (large nodes), most were short threads or single responses. Lastly, activity is date-limited: The vast majority of post activity occurs between 1996-2006—right around when social media platforms like Myspace and Facebook really begin to take off. Most surprising to me, however, was the high incidence of posts in crossdressing groups. What little literature that exists on trans Usenet focuses on AltT and SST as the “big two” of Usenet, but AFCD and ASCD were active and influential in their own right. In ASCD in particular cisgender and variants appear the most, even though the group isn’t mentioned in the print archives as a major hub of discussion.</span>\n\n\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In multiple ways, then, making this network challenged either popular received knowledge about “cisgender” or my own assumptions about what trans Usenet looked like. The numbers can’t tell the whole story, though. Understanding how these posts connect to each other requires a close discourse analysis of individual posts and the connections I’ve visualized here. Otherwise, it’s just a bunch of nodes on a graph: attractive to look at, but not meaningful in any particular way. Instead, this kind of project requires meeting big data with a fine-grained attention for detail that attempts to get at the content of discussions, in order to give those “big data” numbers meaning and context.</span>\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n<sup>1</sup> My data collection actually raises questions about the received narrative for who “first” uses “cisgender.” In 1994, 5 months after Defosse posts, another user posts in the same newsgroup about “cis-gendered, narrow-minded people,” with no clarification as to what the term means.\n\n\n\n<sup>2</sup> Prior to collecting my data, I also checked each message’s content against an automatically generated list of possible common misspellings. However, this process produced no hits.",

How does media and mediation affect our sense of agency? I use the example of A Scanner Darkly (dir. Linklater 2006) to discuss the effects of pervasive media and how it affects the parameters of self-reflection and agency. I look at issues surrounding mediated presence (copresence) and the threat to face-to-face engagement that pervasive media implies. The question I\n\nask is: if as a society we are subjected to a pervasive mediation, how may we imagine modes of agency within an animated world?\n\n\n\nThis talk is co-sponsored by the <a href=\"http://wmst.umd.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Department of Women's Studies</a>, and will be held in the Women's Studies Multimedia Studio, 0135 Taliaferro Hall.\n\n\n\nDr. Beth Coleman's work focuses on the role of human agency in the context of media and data engagement. She is currently a Harvard University Faculty Fellow at Berkman Center for Internet and Society and a visiting professor at the Institute of Network Cultures, Hogeschool van Amsterdam. From 2005-2011, Coleman has been an assistant professor of comparative media studies at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she is the primary investigator of the Pervasive Media/City as Platform research and design lab. Her book <a href=\"http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/hello-avatar\" target=\"_blank\">Hello Avatar: Rise of the Networked Generation</a> is published by the MIT Press. She received her B.A. in literature from Yale University and her Ph.D in comparative literature from New York University.\n\n\n\nComing up @MITH 11/29: Beth Bonsignore, Ann Fraistat, Kari Kraus, Amanda Visconti, \"It's not a game to me:\" ARGs, Game Design, and Secret Agents in the Schoolroom\n\n\n\nA continuously updated schedule of talks is also available on the <a href=\"../podcast/\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Dialogues</a> webpage.\n\n\n\nUnable to attend the events in person? Archived podcasts can be found on the MITH website, and you can follow our Digital Dialogues Twitter account <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#%21/digdialog\" target=\"_blank\">@digdialog</a> as well as the Twitter hashtag #mithdd to keep up with live tweets from our sessions.\n\n\n\nAll talks free and open to the public.

GOLD\n\nWhat role should social networking play in academic communities, and what kinds of collaborations can result from the inclusion of social media in university networks? Using the CUNY Academic Commons – a site created by and for faculty members, graduate students, and administrators from the 23 campuses of the City University of New York – as a case study, Professor Gold will discuss the emergence of a new generation of university-sponsored virtual spaces that foreground social interaction as they attempt to foster collaborative research communities.  Though not without complications, such spaces afford an alternate view of the intellectual life of the university, one that has the potential to offer a more engaging vision of academic life at a time when the humanities in particular, and universities more generally, are being asked to demonstrate their value to the wider public.\n\nMATTHEW K. GOLD is Assistant Professor of English at New York City College of Technology, CUNY, and a faculty member in the Interactive Technology and Pedagogy Program at The CUNY Graduate Center. Recent and forthcoming work includes articles in <em>The Journal of Modern Literature</em>, <em>Kairos</em>, and <em>On the Horizon</em>, and a chapter in the forthcoming book <em>From A to &lt;A&gt;: Keywords of Markup. </em>His projects include “Looking for Whitman,” a multi-campus experiment in digital pedagogy sponsored by two NEH Digital Humanities Start-Up Grants, and a recently awarded Title V Grant from the U.S. Department of Education.

    "wp post content": "Our Bootcamp is continuing into its second day.\n\nThis morning we broke up into two main hacker groups: those interested in Annotation tools and those interested in creating a (better) text editing tools. Due to my work with OAC, I'm in the Annotation group discussing ideas about an annotation tool. I've started hacking up some code using MITHGrid to create a front-end application that will work with storing OAC-specification-friendly annotations to an online microservice.  Our service that we're making in this group has a lot of the same goals as things like Zotero, but in this case we want to experiment more and come up with  solutions to specific problems such as how to store and display multiple annotation bodies for one target, and what issues need to be addressed for a user interface that does this. There are some great people in my group, among them Mortiz Wissenbach, Marco Petris, and Asaf Bartov from Wikimedia.\n\nI'll be making updates regularly, but you can check out my code that I'm writing on my Github: <a href=\"http://github.com/jdickie\">http://github.com/jdickie</a>.\n\nThe other main group is focusing on developing ideas and apps for creating a new text editor for editing marked up documents. Their main issue is in displaying overlapping annotations and updating them while the marked up document is being edited (e.g. shifting annotation positions when new text is added, but retaining the overall meaning of the annotation). Gregor Middell from the Faust Edition project and Nick Laiaconafrom NINES are among those working on this, so I'm certain there'll be something great coming out of that group.\n\nForgot to mention yesterday that you can follow the live notes of Interedition Bootcamp Wuerzburg here: <a href=\"http://interedition.eu/wiki/index.php/W%C3%BCrzburg2011/Live_Minutes\">http://interedition.eu/wiki/index.php/W%C3%BCrzburg2011/Live_Minutes</a>\n\n- Grant",

MITH Director Neil Fraistat and Andrea Wiggins, Assistant Professor in the UMD iSchool, will work as Co-PIs with Mary Flanagan at Dartmouth to plan the workshop, which will occur at The University of Maryland from May 6-8, 2015.\n\nThe workshop will culminate and then broaden the conversation begun in the two small face-to-face regional meetings and two webinars that are taking place through the auspices of Dartmouth’s 2014 <a href=\"http://www.imls.gov/\">Institute for Museum and Library Services</a>-funded <a href=\"http://www.crowdconsortium.org/\">National Forum in Crowdsourcing for Libraries and Archives: Creating a Crowdsourcing Consortium </a>(CCLA), also directed by Flanagan. Through this 2 ½ day capstone event, 50 scholars will be brought together from several disciplines as well as representatives from 10 funding agencies in order to consolidate the earlier work of CCLA and seek to advance a truly national, cross-disciplinary agenda. The workshop will also support crowdsourcing efforts among digital humanities groups, museums, libraries, and archives by linking their work to computer science and social science communities and forging a collective consortium.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the event is to assemble collective knowledge about the potential for crowdsourcing infrastructures, content and tools, in order to build an important intellectual and networking bridge for crowdsourced research projects and advance a national and cross-disciplinary agenda.",

    "wp post content": "Why do informal hackathons matter in the Digital Humanities community? I argue that the answer can be found by reading the (soon to be written and released) proceedings of the <a href=\"http://www.interedition.eu/?page_id=192#middle\">Interedition Symposium</a>: Scholarly Digital Editions, Tools and Infrastructure. Joris Van Zundert, a member of the Huygens Institut in The Hague, Netherlands, played host to over 40 scholars, researchers, and programmers this past March. I got to meet Joris last year when I was invited through former MITH project lead Doug Reside and my work on the <a title=\"Text-Image Linking Environment\" href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/research/text-image-linking-environment/\">TILE</a> project. The well-spoken and incredibly intelligent Van Zundert has been working on the Interedition project since 2008 to promote interdisciplinary, inter-collegial, and inter-departmental work in the Digital Humanities. To quote their website's advert for the Symposium, Interedition sponsors groups of programmer-scholars (such as Doug, MITH Software Architect Jim Smith, and myself) to gather and develop interoperable tools as well as generate \"roadmaps\" toward crossing institutional boundaries and research schedules to get DH centers to work collaboratively. March 2012 not only marked the ending of the general funding for Interedition but also a celebration of its efforts.\n\nThe festivities came in the form of a two-day series of presentations from researchers and programmers connected with Interedition, or at least sharing its ideals of collaboration. Interedition invites and encourages others to participate in all of their events, thus practicing their own preaching about cross-institutional collaboration. Speakers ranged from different disciplines in the Humanities, the tech industry, and researchers dabbling in code.\n\nI've participated since early 2011 with two Interedition Bootcamps and have worked with Asaf Bartov, Moritz Wissenbach, and Marco Petris on annotation tools inspired by early <a href=\"http://www.openannotation.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Open Annotation Collaboration</a> specifications. On behalf of those efforts, Moritz, Marco and I presented the annotation service infrastructure and related clients at the March Symposium. I opened by discussing the lack of true interoperable data in the TILE project: that we still have necessary development to be done on integrating different data streams and sources into TILE. What OAC offered the group at Interedition was a more interoperable format for storing annotation data, that is, the data is separated out from the presentation and analysis of the data. Marco and Moritz went on to demonstrate their annotation clients - a Google Chrome plugin that generates a copy of any XML text data to be annotated, and a GWT client that downloads text and allows users to create annotated highlights of the text. Both of these clients use the RAXLD Ruby-on-Rails annotation storage and retrieval service (Developer: Asaf Bartov) and the Java-based fragment-context server (Developers: Marco and Moritz).\n\nThe slides for our presentation are open and can be found <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/present/edit?id=0AXZO5QvmqzzsZGhqbm16enNfMTFoc3I4N3NneA\">here</a>.\n\nThe proceedings of the Symposium were too packed and full of interesting subjects that, during our presentation, I had little time to explain the real importance of Interedition and my sub-project. Put simply, the experience of interacting with international programmers whom I would never have met in another conference or local THATCamps or hackathons, is enough for me to support the causes of Interedition. Open venues where programmers and career coders can meet up are sources of peer-to-peer learning, development, and progress in a career such as mine. This works for the academic field of Digital Humanities too: whether it is working for a powerhouse such as MITH or for a college humanities professor, DH is about learning from other's open-source work. As Doug Reside pointed out in his presentation on the first day of the symposium, hackathons serve as the career-developers scholarly conference. COST, Europe's funding agency for the Arts and Sciences, has somewhat unknowingly backed up funding for Bootcamps that extend over several days, allowing for evenly paced hacking sessions that felt more like structured projects in some cases. When Van Zundert closed the Symposium with a 30-minute presentation on the work of Interedition from a birds-eye view, he advocated this about the format and methodology of his bootcamps: a day-long hackathon is easy to generate and fund, but produces limited results. Week-long sessions require funding and additional planning, but can produce elegant work such as Interedition's Collate and CollateX services. Thus is a successful and enjoyable format for programmer interchange born.\n\nLooking ahead, longer bootcamps found around the world at DHSI, Bamboo, and DARIAH are still needed and still need to be refined. Bamboo has encountered obstacles in its path of developing interoperable cloud tools, as has Interedition in its organization and funding. Yet instead of abandoning global and cross-institutional efforts such as these, it is vital to continue them because we are still working out the kinks on something great. In terms of Interedition-scale Bootcamps, developers such as myself need these to enthuse collaboration and discovery just as traditional scholars need to meet face-to-face once every year or more to share research and align their goals. Despite the rise of remote resource management tools such as Github and Basecamp in the open-source programming world, real human interaction is still important, so an argument that we all work on the internet and do not require anything more intimate is false. When creating quick mock-ups and prototypes for research and development for digital tools, having colleagues right at hand allows for quick development and sharing of knowledge. Skype doesn't allow the kind of inspirational moments that come from sharing time with a group of people, eating with them, then meeting later at the hotel to work even longer (all traditions that we kept at each Interedition Bootcamp).\n\nProgrammers are indeed pro-active at times and so our group, post-Symposium, wasted no time talking about what is next. Interedition continues to work to find additional funding and ways to continue offering programmers and research-field insiders the means to interact in hands-on sessions. Van Zundert has accepted the mantle of head of Interedition and will be in charge of seeing his framework of informal bootcamps and planning sessions live on. Whether Interedition gets picked up by another series of funding now or in the future, I assert that it will serve as a marker for the way in which open-source, academic programming careers will operate.\n\n<em>Learn more about</em><em> Interedition on their website (<a href=\"http://www.interedition.eu\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.interedition.eu</a>).

Lothian will talk about her book in conversation with <a href=\"https://gamertrouble.wordpress.com/\">Amanda Phillips</a>, who is an Assistant Professor in the <a href=\"https://english.asu.edu/about/academic-program-areas/film-and-media-studies-program\">Department of English and Film and Media Studies</a> at Georgetown University.\n\n\n\nFrom the dust jacket:\n\n\n\nO<em>ld Futures explores the social, political, and cultural forces feminists, queer people, and people of color invoke when they dream up alternative futures as a way to imagine transforming the present. Lothian shows how queer possibilities emerge when we practice the art of speculation: of imagining things otherwise than they are and creating stories from that impulse. Queer theory offers creative ways to think about time, breaking with straight and narrow paths toward the future laid out for the reproductive family, the law-abiding citizen, and the believer in markets. Yet so far it has rarely considered the possibility that, instead of a queer present reshaping the ways we relate to past and future, the futures imagined in the past can lead us to queer the present.</em>\n\n\n\n<em>Narratives of possible futures provide frameworks through which we understand our present, but the discourse of “the” future has never been a singular one. Imagined futures have often been central to the creation and maintenance of imperial domination and technological modernity; Old Futures offers a counterhistory of works that have sought––with varying degrees of success––to speculate otherwise. Examining speculative texts from the 1890s to the 2010s, from Samuel R. Delany to Sense8, Lothian considers the ways in which early feminist utopias and dystopias, Afrofuturist fiction, and queer science fiction media have insisted that the future can and must deviate from dominant narratives of global annihilation or highly restrictive hopes for redemption.</em>\n\n\n\n<em><img class=\"wp-image-20576 size-portfolio-five alignright\" src=\"https://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/alexis-lothian-177x142.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"177\" height=\"142\" />Each chapter chronicles some of the means by which the production and destruction of futures both real and imagined takes place: through eugenics, utopia, empire, fascism, dystopia, race, capitalism, femininity, masculinity, and many kinds of queerness, reproduction, and sex. Gathering stories of and by populations who have been marked as futureless or left out by dominant imaginaries, Lothian offers new insights into what we can learn from imaginatively redistributing the future now.</em>",

Please see parts <a href=\"https://mith.umd.edu/little-big-data/\">1</a> and <a href=\"https://mith.umd.edu/little-big-data/\">2</a> for more context.</em>\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n<strong>Why</strong>\n\n\n\nFor this project, I chose to explore the reactionary responses to comedian Michelle Wolf's performance at the 2018 White House Correspondents’ Dinner. The host's role at the annual Correspondents’ Dinner is difficult in that it requires striking a balance of tone -- how to roast the journalists and politicians in the room, and appeal to a wider audience, as the performance is streamed live? Wolf's job was particularly difficult, given the fact that the current president does not attend the dinners, and has routinely skewered journalists online in countless offensive and incendiary Twitter rants. Wolf, then, was faced with the same choice that all citizens face, but on a much more visible platform: to treat the administration lightly, and fall complicit in inaction, or to call out the horrors of the administration and face the attendant outrage machine. Wolf chose the latter, and, as has become the norm lately, Twitter became the outrage machine's medium (or even, weapon) of choice. Why do some Twitter users use direct address - tweeting at someone, in this case, Wolf - as part of their expression of outrage? Why is this particular address used?\n\n\n\n<strong>How</strong>\n\n\n\nI gathered two data sets in an attempt to track the reaction time of the outrage machine. I set the parameters of my twarc search to include only tweets sent to Michelle Wolf's account (@michelleisawolf) that included #WHCD in the message. My first set was for the time window of April 28th, the day of the dinner, to April 29th , and my second set was from April 28th to April 30th. The first set included only four tweets, all of which expressed excitement and enthusiasm. The second set is considerably more expansive, including 3,285 tweets. For the purposes of this exercise, my data story will consider the more generative results from the longer, second time frame. My goal in designing the search this way was to explore the ways in which those on Twitter utilized the direct address of tweeting at Michelle Wolf to express their opinions - be they positive or negative - about her remarks. How does the direct address change the reactionary politics of Twitter? And what do I gain as a researcher in utilizing search parameters that do not engage with the nuances of subtweeting?\n\n\n\n<strong>What</strong>\n\n\n\nThe data set poses questions about user languages, verified accounts, and the hijacking of hashtags. First, in regards to languages, while English is the predominant language in the data set, 104 tweets were grouped in the \"und\" category. \"und\" is not on the list of Twitter verified languages. It can be implied that \"und\" denotes an \"unidentified\" language, though even this is unclear. This data would lead one to assume that accounts writing tweets in an \"und\" language are bots, but upon pulling up an \"und\" tweet, the tweet itself is in legible English, voicing support for Michelle Wolf and adding a #NerdProm hashtag to complement the #WHCD. The tweet is by co-creator of the Daily Show, Lizz Winstead's, verified account.\n\n\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-20216\" src=\"https://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/schollaert-fig1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"975\" height=\"540\" />\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/lizzwinstead/status/990421997657214978\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-20217\" src=\"https://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/schollaert-fig2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"975\" height=\"903\" /></a>\n\n\n\nIt's unclear how Twitter determines that an account is using an \"und\" or unidentified language, and this practice may be, to invoke <a href=\"https://twitter.com/safiyanoble\">Safiya Noble</a>'s work in <a href=\"http://algorithmsofoppression.com/\">Algorithms of Oppression</a>, technologically redlining some accounts that do not use standard or easily identifiable registers of language. In terms of verified accounts, the data set notes that only 21 accounts, or .6%, of the tweets came from verified accounts. Continuing to explore Lizz Winstead's tweet, the original tweet itself is not a part of the data set, but the six retweets are included in the set. None of the six users who retweeted Lizz Winstead are listed as verified, despite the fact that the original tweet came from a verified source. How does this change the way we examine information, ideas, or phrases that circulate? Does the fact that the tweet came from a verified source change the way it is read as part of a tweet by an unverified user? What work has been done about the potential to weaponize the verification tool to further technologically redline individuals from marginalized communities?\n\n\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-20218\" src=\"https://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/schollaert-fig3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"975\" height=\"538\" />\n\n\n\nFinally, I want to consider how the data set tools are inherently incomplete due to the fact that it is difficult to capture or collect tweets that are \"subtweets,\" or that are clearly about an event, but do not reference the event hashtags or do not include any clear links to the subject of the tweet. For example, the tweet below by <em>New York Times</em> journalist Maggie Haberman is clearly about the jokes Wolf made at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, yet it does not contain any hashtags, any reference to a dinner, or any clear identifier beyond her inclusion of Sarah Huckabee Sanders' Twitter handle. Additionally, Haberman misreads Wolf's joke, even referring to the piece of the performance as \"criticism.\" Yes, a performance can be criticism, but Haberman's tweet dangerously misinterprets Wolf's joke. How can we cast a wider net in collecting data sets to ensure that information such as Haberman's tweet is not lost? Haberman's was one of the most consistently referenced tweets about Wolf's performance, so much so that Wolf herself replied. How can data sets be used more expansively to capture a bigger picture of the events chronicled on Twitter? I wonder if tools like sentiment analysis could be used on a wide batch of tweets within a certain time frame to sort through possible subtweets, and more specific data sets could be useful for more pointed, specific analyses.\n\n\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-20219\" src=\"https://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/schollaert-fig4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"975\" height=\"667\" />\n\n\n\nExploring the data set raised more questions than it answered, and I wonder how useful data sets are in terms of capturing the nuance of any given cultural event or text. Why use data sets to explore nuance? To gather the numbers to complement a particular, nuanced argument? To provide evidence of technological redlining, of the gaps that exist that nuanced critique needs to fill? While I have no clear argument regarding the reactionary Twitter politics of the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, I do have a greater suspicion about the way in which Twitter quantifies our emotionally-charged communications, and the ways in which this data itself can be hijacked similarly to the hijacking of hashtags.\n\n\n\n<em>You can view the dataset this story was based on <a href=\"https://github.com/jeschollaert/datastory/\">at GitHub.</a></em>",

    "wp post content": "<em>MEI to VexFlow</em> is a JavaScript library used to render music notation encoded according to the  <a href=\"http://music-encoding.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Music Encoding Initiative</a> (MEI) format. MEI is a community-driven effort to create a commonly-accepted, digital, symbolic representation of music notation documents, while keeping in mind the needs of textual scholars and the Digital Humanities.\n\n\n\nThe three-month project supported by Google Summer of Code is at its mid-term milestone, and on this occasion it’s worth to have a look what has been achieved and what is coming up for the rest of the project.\n\n\n\nDuring our first month and a half, I’ve been busy revising the existing code and adding new features. The main objective was extending the repertoire and the range of MEI features that <em>MEI to VexFlow</em> can support. In order to achieve that, I first focused on <strong>improving the handling of “lines” such as slurs, ties and hairpins</strong>. This work is very much an under-the-hood improvement, but it is important, because it paves the way for dealing with the quite common phenomenon of hairpins and slurs that do not begin and end precisely with a note on the staff.\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n[fusion_builder_container hundred_percent=\"yes\" overflow=\"visible\"][fusion_builder_row][fusion_builder_column type=\"1_1\" background_position=\"left top\" background_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" border_color=\"\" border_style=\"solid\" spacing=\"yes\" background_image=\"\" background_repeat=\"no-repeat\" padding=\"\" margin_top=\"0px\" margin_bottom=\"0px\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_direction=\"left\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" center_content=\"no\" min_height=\"none\"][caption id=\"attachment_10850\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"704\"]<a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-05-at-09.52.03.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-10850 size-full\" title=\"Introduction and Allegro by Maurice Ravel\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-05-at-09.52.03.png\" alt=\"Introduction and Allegro by Maurice Ravel\" width=\"704\" height=\"115\" /></a> Figure 1: First four measures from Introduction and Allegro by Maurice Ravel, flute and clarinet parts only (scan)[/caption]\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMEI provides two ways of describing where a line begins and where it ends. The most straightforward way is to specify that a crescendo, for instance, ‘starts at note one in measure two and ends at note two in measure two’, as in the example below:\n\n\n\nOn the other hand there are instances when the line doesn’t exactly correspond to the start of notes. For these cases MEI allows the encoder to specify two points in time expressed as beats. For example the diminuendo in the second bar of the Ravel example (Figure 1) starts roughly on the third beat, hence one can describe it as a ‘<em>diminuendo starting at beat three and ending at beat “five”—that is at the very end of the measure</em>’. Or indeed, in the fourth measure the crescendo ‘<em>starts at beat one and ends at beat three</em>’.\n\n\n\nI’ve made <em>MEI to VexFlow</em> capable of dealing with such encodings, in other words, it is now possible to display lines that are described with beats in the MEI file. Although, VexFlow is only capable of drawing lines that start and end with a note, so my solution was to find the closest notes of two given beats and to draw the lines as if they were attached to such notes. This is a very important step towards more advanced support for these objects. In the future it will be possible to render the lines between the correct locations by calculating offsets from the closest notes.\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n[/fusion_builder_column][fusion_builder_column type=\"1_1\" background_position=\"left top\" background_color=\"\" border_size=\"\" border_color=\"\" border_style=\"solid\" spacing=\"yes\" background_image=\"\" background_repeat=\"no-repeat\" padding=\"\" margin_top=\"0px\" margin_bottom=\"0px\" class=\"\" id=\"\" animation_type=\"\" animation_speed=\"0.3\" animation_direction=\"left\" hide_on_mobile=\"no\" center_content=\"no\" min_height=\"none\"][caption id=\"attachment_10853\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"268\"]<a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-05-at-17.20.55.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-10853 \" title=\"Second measure from Introduction and Allegro by Maurice Ravel\" src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-05-at-17.20.55.png\" alt=\"Second measure from Introduction and Allegro by Maurice Ravel\" width=\"268\" height=\"114\" /></a> Figure 2: Second measure from Introduction and Allegro by Maurice Ravel, flute and clarinet part only (as rendered by MEI to VexFlow) MEI to VexFlow draws displays the diminuendo, even though it’s starting at the notehead of the third note in the measure.[/caption]\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSeveral other features have been introduced. <strong>Now it’s possible to display changing time signature, meter or clef</strong>.

Historical musical pieces make their way to us through multiple documents and it often happens that multiple sources introduce differences and variants in the music. We are designing a sample web application that will be able to display 15–16<sup>th</sup> century music and provide a dynamic mechanism for the user to select which variant they want to see.\n\n\n\nTo achieve this, we are adding new parsing interface to <em>MEI to VexFlow</em> in order to expose the set of variants encoded in the input file. A web application will be able to display this information to the user and allow them to make their choices before rendering, and to see multiple variants at the same time.[/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]",

MITHgrid is a JavaScript framework for building data-oriented, event-driven browser applications. It is for building browser-based applications composed of a small core and a set of plugins.\n\nI have been fascinated by Browsers and JavaScript from the start and have been working on it for quite some. JavaScript is a very powerful and dynamic language. It is one of the only few languages ever to get so much attention and investment (in terms of money, developer time). Browsers are becoming powerful everyday. Google and Mozilla have invested a lot in it and they speculate that most of activities the end users perform can be done on just a browser (remember Chromebook!). Firefox mobile OS apps are made natively through HTML5 and JS.\n\nI have been developing single page web-apps for the a year now and with experience I can say its very easy to end up with spaghetti code. Concepts of test driven development, version control and a very robust JS framework are imperative for building scalable webapps. I am particularly excited about this GSoC because I will working on extending a JS framework which will expose me to low level nitigrities of JavaScript. MITHgrid places graphDB at the center which is a very promising approach to create framework for JavaScript.",

The show is directed by MITH's intern and Theater, Dance, and Performance Studies graduate student Victoria Scrimer.

The show will feature digital images and transcriptions from the Archive to highlight poignant passages and unused textual variants.\n\n\n\nFrom the Theater, Dance, and Performance Studies department <a href=\"http://tdps.umd.edu/event/2013-2014/wednesday-lecture-series-2\">blog</a>:\n\n<blockquote>In collaboration with the Maryland Institute of Technology in the Humanities (MITH), TDPS presents a dramatic reading of Percy Shelley’s rarely-performed lyric drama, Prometheus Unbound featuring digital imagery of Shelley’s original manuscripts.\n\n\n\nWilliam Godwin, Percy Shelley’s father-in-law, is famously quoted as saying “God himself has no right to be a tyrant” and in many ways that is what Prometheus Unbound movingly professes. A condemnation of slavery in all forms, Prometheus Unbound is perhaps Shelley’s best-known and most beloved work. Inspired by Aeschylus’ classical Prometheia trilogy, Shelley adapts the mythological story of the Titan who gave man fire, refiguring the fate of mankind’s champion and the fall of the tyrant, Jupiter. It is a drama of Romantic ideals-- suffering, endurance, and freedom-- that is as relevant in today’s socio-political climate of resistance as it was two centuries ago.\n\n\n\nWednesday, October 25, 3-5PM, Cafritz Foundation Theatre</blockquote>",

    "wp post content": "<p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-3dd7ef4e-ba14-15b6-a31f-2f7c8418cc51\">Making the Digital Humanities More Open, a level 2 Digital Humanities Start Up grant funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities, ended its work earlier this fall. A partnership between the University of South Carolina Upstate and the University of Maryland's Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH), the project featured a team of scholars including George Williams and Tina Herzberg of USC Upstate, Jim Smith, Amanda Visconti, Kirsten Keister, and myself (MITH), as well as Cory Bohon (independent scholar).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our goal for the project was to design, develop, and deploy a WordPress‐based accessibility tool to create Braille content for end-users who are blind or have low vision. Over the last several decades, scholars have developed standards for how best to create, organize, present, and preserve digital information so that future generations of teachers, students, scholars, and librarians may still use it. What has remained neglected for the most part, however, are the needs of people with disabilities. As a result, many of the otherwise most valuable digital resources are useless for people who are blind or have low vision with assistive devices like screen readers and refreshable Braille displays. Our premise was “is there a way to directly manipulate WordPress text into Braille without having to go through a separate device?”</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">So we set out to create a free and easy‐to‐use plugin for WordPress that creates Braille texts from WordPress posts, allowing any WordPress site to share the products of their text‐based projects with this often‐neglected audience of readers. Originally, we planned to extend the use of Anthologize—a free and open source plugin for WordPress that currently translates any RSS text into PDF, ePub, HTML, or TEI—to include the conversion of text to Braille. Yet, as we began our work, it became apparent that it would be far more efficient to begin by creating a direct WordPress plugin that could be included in core application releases that could be supplemented by the Anthologize-enabled plugin.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The WordPress plugin consists of two components: 1) the plugin itself which works natively with any WordPress installation with the plugin activated and 2) extending the current Anthologize plugin to provide SimBraille and embossable forms of Braille translations as well as the pre-existing document types available via anthologize (PDF, ePUB, TEI). We can do this via a simple RESTful service providing the English to Braille translation utilizing the LibLouis open source software that provides a Braille translation library. To make it as useable as possible, the plugin can be configured to use either a locally installed version of the LibLouis software or a remote server that can be made available from the cloud. We’ve constructed an Amazon Machine Image for use by anyone who wishes to have a remote server loaded with LibLouis up and running for their project in a low-cost option. This will be particularly useful for teachers who can’t load software in their computer labs, users who might be using different machines to develop their site that do not all have access to the local installation, and instructors who travel between schools and classes.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The RESTful service is written in Ruby as a Sinatra application (<a href=\"http://www.sinatrarb.com/\">http://www.sinatrarb.com/</a>). Because Sinatra is built on Rack (<a href=\"http://rack.github.io/\">http://rack.github.io/</a>), any of the available Rack middleware can be used to provide authentication, authorization, or other services. What this means is that a school district or institution could open up a cloud service for all its teachers without much effort. They’d only need to provide their login credentials on the machine they are using and the service would be up and running in minutes. In our test deployment, we added a caching web server between the WordPress site and the Sinatra service to make it easier for users to load and interact with the service.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These two components fulfil the goals of the grant: providing a plugin that can create Braille translations of texts organized through Anthologize. Long term though, I’ve got some ideas about what is going to come next.</p>\nWe’ve already started on the most preliminary development. We’ve just recently launched a private beta version of a curriculum for Braille training in partnership with Tina Herzberg and her colleague Penny Rosenblum at the University of Arizona. When we were working on Making the Digital Humanities More Open, Tina talked about how great it would be to be able to extend our digital Braille work to classrooms. They’d just started a grant to create large scale curricular materials to train people in Braille literacy. That project, Braille RISE, began a few months ago. We’ve deployed a Moodle instance (an open source content management service for teaching and learning) and created a Braille Short Code filter that allows Tina and Penny to render Braille in the Moodle instance. For example, by using [SimBraille] and [/SimBraille] pair, we can transform 34 into the appropriate Braille cells.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/R0Li2KZx6G8JOpZWnAyeD6rtsO-ltVaF-K5lYzHt1_qI63WQr2mrUQ3F9YFa3yQKNvY7fYO892lqOkJvIglOaAaxg8M9te457yUuBevxg6DYcY3cJSzcLGLAXA\" width=\"205px;\" height=\"162px;\" />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What this means is that they don’t have to  insert pictures or use video to show the correct Braille layout. Nor, by the way, do they have to use the six-key keyboard entry system that most Braille users use to render the cells. It all works in plain-text.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our next stage will, we hope, allow us to round trip the Braille. Right now, for students to answer the questions correctly in Braille, we give them multiple choice answers. We’d like to create an input option where students could directly enter Braille using six key or even a refreshable Braille display to enter long form answers. That would then translate to plain text for the instructors so that they could have automated answer corrections.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Along the way, we are also hoping to round out one more area of this project that is tied to our other group project, Accessible Future. When we were building the WordPress plugin and the Moodle filter, it was readily apparent that there is a need for simple WordPress themes that are entirely accessible on both the front end (the theme) and the backend (the dashboard). Our plan for spring is to begin working on a custom set of themes that would natively integrate accessibility plugins. This would shortcut so many steps for users who right now have to sort through the various plugins, install, activate, and configure their settings. We are hoping to have plugins like the Braille plugin, Access Keys, WP-Accessibility and others embedded within the themes. And once we’ve conquered that, we want to take on the backend so that it is fully accessible for blind, low-vision, cognitive, and auditorily disabled users.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Accessibility fundamentally enables us all and our hope is that these project products and future deliverables will enable more digital humanists to not just meet accessibility standards but innovate new technologies that are fully accessible to all users.</p>",

    "wp post content": "<strong>ELO PLUGS INTO NEW HUB: MITH @ MARYLAND</strong>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"http://www.eliterature.org\">Electronic Literature Organization</a> (ELO) is now establishing its new headquarters at The <a href=\"http://www.mith.umd.edu\">Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities</a> (MITH) at the University of Maryland, College Park. The move, which has been made possible by sponsorship from MITH, the English department at Maryland, the College of Arts and Humanities, and the University Libraries, was officially made July 1, 2006.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Neil Fraistat</strong>, director of MITH, said of the move: \"In moving from UCLA to the University of Maryland, the ELO will provide MITH with a unique opportunity for a truly comprehensive program in the Digital Humanities, one that focuses equally on migrating electronically the cultural artifacts of the past and the production of the cultural artifacts of the future.\" <strong>Thom Swiss</strong>, president of the ELO, added: \"The Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) at the University of Maryland, College Park, is internationally known and, together with the support of its campus partners in this venture, makes for the best possible home for the ELO because of our similar and now collaborative interests and ambitions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFounded in 1999 in Chicago, the ELO is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization made up of writers, scholars, educators, and technologists dedicated to exploring how computers can be used for literary expression, and how born-digital work can use the computer and the network to build on and extend the tradition of literature. Landmark events in the ELO's short history include:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* The launch of the Electronic Literature Directory, an acclaimed database-driven resource of information about electronic literature maintained by authors and visited by thousands of readers;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Readings of electronic literature and outreach events in Chicago, New York, Seattle, Boston, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Providence;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* The Electronic Literature Awards, which recognized exemplary works of poetry and fiction and rewarded winners with substantial cash prizes;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* The State of the Arts Symposium, which united over one hundred international writers, scholars, and publishers of electronic literature at UCLA for two days of panels and presentations and produced hard-copy proceedings; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* The Preservation, Archiving, and Dissemination (PAD) project's publication of two reports, Acid-Free Bits: Recommendations for Long-Lasting Electronic Literature and Born-Again Bits: A Framework for Migrating Electronic Literature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ELO has an international network of directors, literary advisors, and members. The organization'ss university partners include the University of Iowa, the University of Illinois Chicago, and the University of Pennsylvania. After the headquarters of the ELO moves to Maryland, partnerships with these universities, and the partnership with UCLA, will continue, as will electronic literature readings, events, and activities across the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe partnership between MITH and the ELO will help both organizations pursue their related missions. The ELO will work, with MITH's help, to further its programs and its impact, both internationally and on the Maryland campus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ELO has long sought a partnership with a major research library to further its initiatives in the realm of the preserving, archiving, and disseminating electronic literature. <strong>Charles Lowry</strong>, dean of the <a href=\"http://www.lib.umd.edu\">University Libraries</a> at Maryland, said: \"To say that the scholarly information exchange is transforming academic and research libraries belabors the obvious. Nonetheless it is an essential condition for defining what libraries will be in the future. Libraries have played an historic role by providing the secure archive for the scholarly record. This is vital work worth preserving, but that will be done in a multitude of new ways. Among them, libraries must assume responsibility for the output of scholarly and creative work that is born digital. This is one of the most important reasons that from my perspective the University of Maryland Libraries have supported the ELO's move to our campus.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, a working relationship with a major English department will allow the ELO to develop its curricular and pedagogical initiatives in a new way; one of these initiatives, the Electronic Literature Collection (a digital literary annual to be made available online and on CD-ROM) is already in progress, with MITH as one of its five sponsors. <strong>Charles Caramello</strong>, (former) chair of the <a href=\"http://www.english.umd.edu\">English department</a>, said: \"The English Department looks forward to ELO's joining the Maryland community. ELO perfectly complements Departmental emphases on creative writing, comparative literary arts, and digital and textual studies; and its presence on campus will greatly enhance opportunities for Departmental faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates to collaborate with artists and scholars in the vanguard of literature and literary scholarship using twenty-first century technologies.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>James F. Harris</strong>, dean of the <a href=\"http://www.arhu.umd.edu\">College of Arts and Humanities</a> at Maryland, also noted how the ELO will complement the campus's existing strengths, saying: \"The College of Arts and Humanities is very pleased to welcome the ELO to the University of Maryland campus. We have long had a focus on the creative and performing arts, as well as the use of new technologies in traditional humanities settings; the ELO, with its emphasis on the artistic and imaginative use of computers and new media, is a natural fit and helps complete that circle. I look forward to a broad range of activities and events that enhance the creative and intellectual life of the College.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMedia Contact: Matthew Kirschenbaum,\r\n\r\nAssistant Professor of English, University of Maryland\r\n\r\nAssociate Director,\r\n\r\nMaryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH)\r\n\r\nDirector,\r\n\r\nThe Electronic Literature Organization\r\n\r\nTel: 301-405-8505\r\n\r\nBest email: mkirschenbaum@gmail.com",

I want to spend a little time today talking about how we are approaching the technical side of some of our DH projects, namely how we are designing our JavaScript libraries.\n\nHere at MITH, we want to do more with less. We want our output to be exponential: proportional to how much we have already produced. This means that we have to be able to leverage our past work in our current work. We have to maximize reusability of everything we write.\n\nThe problem is that we can't spend a lot of time on a grant writing code that we aren't going to use for the grant deliverable. It would be wonderful to be able to create a platform on which we could build our projects, but that platform isn't a grant deliverable, and probably won't ever be one because it doesn't produce anything interesting in the humanities.\n\nTo try and get around this problem as we wrote a streaming video annotation client for <a href=\"http://www.openannotation.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Open Annotation</a>, we developed a way of dividing up the code that we write so that we have a good chance of reusing it later. Instead of writing a lot more or a lot less code, we end up writing a lot of different code. The lines we draw between different pieces of code are drawn in different places.\n\nThe first thing we did was make data central to the application. We created an object that holds all of the application's information and is responsible for notifying other components if the information changes. We don't have to worry about copies of the information being out of date. The only component that trusts its copy of the information is the data manager.\n\nThen, we split other pieces up based on responsibility. We have presentations that manage the display of renderings of data items. We have templates that render the items for the presentations. We have controllers that translate user interface events into more meaningful events, allowing us to change the UI interaction without affecting anything else in the application.\n\nNow, we're working on dividing out a few last pieces that we built for development. We'll be releasing the application as a library paired with a small demonstration web page showing how to tie the pieces together.\n\nWe made at least three fundamental decisions in this process.\n\nFirst, we decided to build a data-centric application. Everything is designed to reflect the current state of the data. Because of the way we built the data management piece, we can add new kinds of information without affecting anything else in the application. This means that we don't have to plan just the right hooks for all of the plugins people might want to add to the application. The framework supports them at a level below the semantics of the application.\n\nSecond, we decided to divide code into classes based on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility-driven_design\" target=\"_blank\">responsibility,</a> not based on its use of particular data. Types of components are responsible for a few, well-defined things, and those things are the responsibilities of a few, well-defined components. If what we're trying to write doesn't fit one of those responsibilities, then it doesn't go into that component. Components only track what might be called \"local\" data: information that is specific to the component doing its job and information that is of no concern outside the component.\n\nLast, we went with an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming\" target=\"_blank\">event-driven</a> framework for tying the components together. This fits in well with the way browsers work. It also allows our components to be lazy. Instead of each component watching for changing information and figuring out if it needs to take some action, it waits for the data manager to alert it to changes. The responsibility for firing the event lies with the component responsible for managing the information that triggers the event, so this fits well with the other two decisions. Instead of having to change a component if we want the events to come from a different source, which we would have to do if they were coded to watch for particular data changes, we can just reconfigure which listeners are added to which firers.\n\nThe resulting information flow is somewhat like that in the diagram: the data store fires its event that something has changed, the date view fires its comparable event if the change is within the scope that it is interested in, and the presentation responds by updating the display of the information. If something happens in the presentation to indicate that something in the data should be changed, the presentation calls a method on the data store to request that the information be changed. This change will lead to another sequence of events.\n\nBefore, we would update our presentation of the information in response to an edit. Now, we're moving to a model where we update our presentation in response to changes in the data, and update the data in response to an edit. This decoupling of input and output ensures that what we see in the presentation will reflect the application's understanding of the information. If we try to change something and we see it change on the screen, then we know that the application understood what we were trying to do and made the change.\n\nWe made a few other decisions along the way that aren't as fundamental as the above three. We're moving towards <a href=\"http://coffeescript.org/\" target=\"_blank\">CoffeeScript</a> since it helps us avoid common pitfalls in JavaScript. We're using <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20140803035447/http://fluidproject.org/blog/2008/07/21/about-this-and-that/\" target=\"_blank\">that-ism instead of this-ism.</a> We're working on three levels of documentation: code, API, and tutorial.\n\nBy making sure we get the local boundaries of the components right by basing them on a set of principles instead of a project-specific API, we don't have to worry about fitting into some grand API scheme in order to have interoperability. The end result is a set of components that we can use in other projects. For example, the component that renders the spatial constraints over the video is just as happy rendering them over scans of a manuscript.\n\nWe'll be releasing two libraries in the next few months: the streaming video annotation client and a core library supporting this event-driven, responsibility-oriented, data-centric way of building applications. Both will be under open source licenses.[/fusion_builder_column][/fusion_builder_row][/fusion_builder_container]",

We're pleased to kick off the fall semester with a presentation from two of our recent Graduate Travel Grant recipients, <strong>Kimberlee Staking</strong> and <strong>Nikki Stewart</strong>, both doctoral candidates in Women's Studies:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStaking and Stewart will offer critical reflections on a successful workshop they facilitated at the National Women's Studies Association Conference in June 2006.  The workshop, \"Visualizing Women's Studies: Facilitating Visual Learning in the Feminist Classroom,\" was designed to assist feminist instructors to better integrate visual concepts and visual technologies into their women's studies curricula.  Like many interdisciplinary social-justice-oriented humanities fields, one of central aims of women's studies teaching is assisting students to \"see\" the world differently.  And yet many feminist instructors--instructors who are deeply invested in teaching students how to resist sexism in the visual landscape--struggle with teaching visual literacy.  Many also feel intimidated by the prospect of using technology in the classroom.  At this Digital Dialogue, Staking and Stewart will share how they successfully worked with a somewhat technology-a-phobic population of instructors to inspire them to take more risks to integrate digital technologies into their humanities teaching. See <a href=\"http://www.arhu.umd.edu/\">The Visual Literacy Toolbox</a>.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have an exciting line up of Digital Dialogues scheduled for the remainder of the semester, *every Tuesday* at 12:30. Highlights of upcoming speakers include <strong>Kevin Bertram</strong> (CEO, Distributive Networks), who will present \"You Can Take It With You:  The Nascent Role for Mobile in the Digital Humanities,\" as well as visits from <strong>Daniel Pitti</strong> of the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities at the University of Virginia, <strong>Jason Nelson</strong> (digital artist and poet) from Griffith University in Australia, and <strong>Stuart Moulthrop</strong> and <strong>Nancy Kaplan</strong> from the Information Arts program at the University of Baltimore. Look for our full schedule very soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-5896).",

Currently, we have been working to train Weka to answer a set of questions in which we are interested. In doing so, we have to first provide it data from which it can learn. This requires manual annotations of article documents. It is in doing this that we see the potential of data mining technology.\n\nThe lack of human learning biases is this potential. In order to provide Weka the most accurate learning data set, we have made strict guidelines for how we answer the questions.  Even with these guidelines, it is apparent that without strenuous amounts of personal effort, the questions will always have certain biases. The human opinion is a transient quantity and therefore makes it difficult to apply a scientific approach to the analysis of texts. We build associations every single day, making it impossible to maintain constants in mindset and realistically be able to answer these questions without error.\n\nData mining, on the other hand, has a much more objective learning process. It makes connections solely on the basis of the patterns that the data sets contains. These patterns contain an entirely new and revolutionary insight into texts as they are based on the use of language, what is on the page rather than the ideas, what a reader often infers based on prior personal associations. Even though the training process can be lengthy, the applications for data mining seem endless, considering that without such technology, we would have to go through every bit of text in our data set and annotate them. We foresee data mining as a way for gathering information on any topic that has sufficient amount of available text. For example, national defense agencies can use it to answer queries that could be useful in understanding changes in sentiment as pertaining to whatever topic they are interested in.  We believe that data mining will revolutionize many such industries which aim to understand changes in public sentiment.",

    "wp post content": "I  am a graduate student from the <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">University of Michigan</a> interning this  summer at MITH, working on the topic modeling project that is underway  here. In this post, I will describe the \"what\" and \"why\" of what I have  been doing, and I will try to put it in the wider context of corpus-based approaches.\n\nR&amp;D software developer Travis Brown and others at MITH have developed  Woodchipper, a visualization tool, which runs the Mallet package  developed at the <a href=\"http://www.umass.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">University of Massachusetts at Amherst</a> to perform topic  modeling on a selected corpus, and then displays the results of a  principal-component analysis. An attractive feature of Woodchipper is  that it is oriented towards \"drilling down\" -- a concept that is  particularly relevant to the digital humanities. Those of us who \"do\"  humanities pride ourselves on being <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_reading\" target=\"_blank\">close readers</a> of texts. To be appealing to humanists, topic modeling, insofar as we  can think of it as a method of \"<a href=\"http://mikejohnduff.blogspot.com/2009/11/distant-reading.html\" target=\"_blank\">distant reading</a>,\"  will need to be combined with close reading. Woodchipper allows the  humanist scholar to view individual texts by displaying each page of a  text as a clickable data point on a two-dimensional graph; the spatial  layout of the graph is shaped by the results of the principal component  analysis.\n\nVisualization  between the \"distant\" aspect of the text's high-level attributes -- its  \"topics\" -- and the \"close\" aspects the text -- its individual words --  are crucial. The challenge is the following: why should the researcher  trust the high-level attributes the model says that the text supposedly  has? Only if the visualization bridges the gap between the high-level  and text-level attributes of the text by clearly displaying their  relationship, will the user be likely to trust the high-level properties  discovered by the topic model.\n\nThus  we decided to make the visualization more expressive and richer.  Earlier, Woodchipper displayed only a specified number of topics  adjudged by the algorithm to be the best topics for the page. The  visualization represented each topic as a list of the first few words  that were the most representative of that topic. However, to simply  represent a topic as a few selected words is misleading, because, even if  those selected words represent the highest-probability words in that  topic, the actual probability mass represented by each word in that  topic may be quite different. It would be more logical and more  expressive, therefore, to represent a topic by those words which,  together, add up to a certain specified fraction of the total  probability mass. Doing so necessitates changing the Scala code on the  server side, which furnishes these words, before the Woodchipper client  accesses the topic (and, hence, the words).\n\nWe  also realized that a further change needed to be made. Each page was  too small in size, so that, very often, no word in the page actually  matched the topics for that page. We realized that we probably needed to  break up the documents into larger sized units, in order to show to the  user a more trustworthy picture of how the top-level (\"topics\")  connects with the bottom-level (\"words on a specific page\") when we  metaphorically \"drill down\" from top to bottom.\n\nStay  tuned to the MITH blog for further posts over the course of the summer  from myself and fellow graduate intern, Clay Templeton.",
