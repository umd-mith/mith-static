She has been on the faculty of the [School of Music](http://www.inform.umd.edu/ARHU/Depts/Music/) at the [University of Maryland](http://www.umd.edu/) since 1979. She is currently the Director of [SOL (Spain OnLine)](http://www.e-learning.umd.edu/ethno/), the University of Maryland’s Master of Arts in Ethnomusicology taught in Spanish on the Internet and in Peñíscola, Spain.\nCarolina grew up in Mendoza, in the foothills of the Argentine Andes. She studied violin in Mendoza, Córdoba, and Guadalajara before pursuing a degree in cultural anthropology and archaeology at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma in Mexico City. In 1975 she completed her Ph.D. at Indiana University in Ethnomusicology and Folklore, writing a dissertation on the relationships between music and social organization among the Mapuche of Andean Argentina. Since then she has done extensive research and published on the impact of 1492 on indigenous cultures, the power of sound in healing traditions, the role of music and dance in ritual, and the construction of gender identities through performance.\nShe lives on the Potomac River, where she gardens, paints, explores new musical sounds, kayaks, and continues her work on creativity as a path to healing and transformation.\n",

      "Jessica H. Lu earned her Ph.D. in Communication and Graduate Certificate in Women's Studies from the University of Maryland, College Park, where she now serves as the Associate Director of Design Cultures & Creativity (DCC) in the Honors College. Trained as a rhetorical critic, she is concerned with how we can practice greater care for past, present, and future humans---especially those whose lives are shaped by precarity and state-sanctioned violence---in the ways we use language to create, design, and destroy our worlds. She examines, in particular, the ideas and rhetorical practices that form, advance, and disrupt racist logics in public discourse in the United States. Her work is further positioned at the intersections of African American history, archives, and digital humanities, as she specializes in adapting the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) standard of scholarly markup to critically model, analyze, and amplify Black people's practices of rhetorical invention and innovation.

He teaches courses and leads research in information modeling, data curation, digital humanities, scientific publishing, and the conceptual foundations of information organization. Prior to coming to the Graduate School of Library and Information Science, he was the Director of the Brown University Scholarly Technology Group. Dr. Renear received an AB from Bowdoin College and an MA and PhD from Brown University. His research is typically concerned with foundational issues in the development of formal ontologies for scientific and cultural objects, and the exploitation of those ontologies in data curation, scientific publishing and information system design. Recently his work has focused on fundamental issues in the curation of scientific datasets and conceptual models for data management and preservation. This includes topics such as levels of abstraction and encoding, identity, ontology, etc. His projects are located at the Center for Informatics Research in Science and Scholarship ([CIRSS](http://cirss.lis.illinois.edu/)) and have been funded by NSF and IMLS.\n",

His dissertation (Near Eastern Studies, University of Michigan, 2013) explored how modern computational techniques of text analysis can be applied to the study of premodern Arabic historical sources. In particular, he studied “The History of Islam” (_Taʾrīḫ al-islām_), the largest of surviving biographical collections with over 30,000 biographies, written by the Damascene scholar al-Ḏahabī (d. 1348 CE). He is continuing his research and develops methods of computational analysis for other genres of premodern Arabic literature, mainly large volume collections that can offer insights into long-term and large-scale developments that took place during the pre-modern period of Islamic history. He is working on two book projects: (1) “The History of Islam”: An Essay in Digital Humanities continues the study of al-Ḏahabī’s tremendous collection of biographies, while (2) The Gift to the Knowledgeable 2.0, explores cultural production in the Islamic world until the beginning of the 20th century through the study of the _Hadiyyaŧ al-ʿārifīn_, a bibliographical collection composed by Ismāʿīl Bāšā al-Baġdādī (d. 1920).\n",

Dr. Seales is developing and evaluating new techniques for digital acquisition, restoration, and visualization using real-world library collections with particular focus on preservation and dissemination. He is also the director of the STITCH project (Surgical Technology Integration with Tools for Cognitive Human Factors), which envisions a networked operating room of the future, where computers and surgical instruments are connected.

Trained as a rhetorical critic, she is concerned with how we can practice greater care for past, present, and future humans---especially those whose lives are shaped by precarity and state-sanctioned violence---in the ways we use language to create, design, and destroy our worlds. She examines, in particular, the ideas and rhetorical practices that form, advance, and disrupt racist logics in public discourse in the United States. Her work is further positioned at the intersections of African American history, archives, and digital humanities, as she specializes in adapting the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) standard of scholarly markup to critically model, analyze, and amplify Black people's practices of rhetorical invention and innovation.

A digital humanist with a master’s degree in information studies and a web design background, Amanda’s work focuses on creating and theorizing digital texts as spaces for collaborative learning, playful intervention, and scholarly discovery for stylistically and culturally complex literature; she is interested in combining facets of online narrative ARGs with participatory literary interpretation, intervention, and discovery. She was introduced to ARGs in the fifth grade through a semester-long Oregon Trail simulation and reintroduced through Cory Doctorow’s _Little Brother_ over ten years later. Amanda’s literary interests include _Ulysses_ and other high and late modernist analog hypertext works, electronic literature, and Victorian sensation novels. She also works as Webmaster at the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) and as the Technology Chair for the University of Maryland Graduate English Organization.\n",

At MITH, she has enjoyed being a member of the talented Developers’ Cohort guided by MITH Associate Director, Doug Reside, and has been involved in database design for Shakespeare’s Quartos and TheatreFinder, a collaborative interface for scholars and aficionados of historic theatres. Supported by an NSF EAGER grant under the direction of Kari Kraus (iSchool/ARHU) and Derek Hansen (iSchool/CASCI), she is exploring the potential of Alternate Reality Games (ARGs) to support the design of collaborative technologies for education. Participatory design work with Allison Druin and the HCIL KidsTeam, a group of children aged 7-12 working to develop new technologies, is an integral part of her research, which lies at the intersection of New Media Literacies studies, technology development for collaborative sensemaking and storytelling, and social analytics for communities of learning.\n",

He's originally from Durham, NC and he spent four years of his adolescence in Ile-Ife, Nigeria—his father’s birthplace and one of the cultural touchstones that he incorporates into his scholarship and genre-blending creative writing.\nIn the digital humanities, Kola is focused on exploring the dynamics of emerging technologies in relation to marginalized communities within the US and abroad. His undergraduate thesis specifically looked at how these communities used virtual spaces and technology in ways that subverted their mainstream, intended use. These moments of disruption are his primary interest and Kola continues to expand on this work through his position at AADHum.\nHis fiction is also inspired by these cultural and technological intersections—the new ways that the material world changes how people engage with each other. Though these narratives tend to manifest through prose, Kola has also developed mixed media projects implementing video, glitch art, and prose fiction. Kola’s speculative short stories can be found in Clarkesworld and FIYAH, and he was a writer-in-residence at Beijing's Red Gate Gallery in 2019.\nKola has degrees in Computer Science and English from Amherst College, and he is currently represented by Matt Belford at the Tobias Literary Agency. You can find him on Twitter at @KolaHR or at [kolaheywardrotimi.com](http://kolaheywardrotimi.com).\n",

      "Kola Heyward-Rotimi is a Faculty Assistant at the University of Maryland's African-American History, Culture, and Digital Humanities initiative (AADHum). He's originally from Durham, NC and he spent four years of his adolescence in Ile-Ife, Nigeria—his father’s birthplace and one of the cultural touchstones that he incorporates into his scholarship and genre-blending creative writing.\nIn the digital humanities, Kola is focused on exploring the dynamics of emerging technologies in relation to marginalized communities within the US and abroad. His undergraduate thesis specifically looked at how these communities used virtual spaces and technology in ways that subverted their mainstream, intended use. These moments of disruption are his primary interest and Kola continues to expand on this work through his position at AADHum.\nHis fiction is also inspired by these cultural and technological intersections—the new ways that the material world changes how people engage with each other. Though these narratives tend to manifest through prose, Kola has also developed mixed media projects implementing video, glitch art, and prose fiction. Kola’s speculative short stories can be found in Clarkesworld and FIYAH, and he was a writer-in-residence at Beijing's Red Gate Gallery in 2019.\nKola has degrees in Computer Science and English from Amherst College, and he is currently represented by Matt Belford at the Tobias Literary Agency. You can find him on Twitter at @KolaHR or at kolaheywardrotimi.com."

      "Mirona Magearu is a PhD Candidate in Comparative Literature at University of Maryland, College Park. She received her bachelor’s degree from The University of Bucharest, Romania, a Master’s degree in communication from The National School of Political Studies, Bucharest, and another Master’s degree in English from Emporia State University, Kansas. During her graduate studies she became fascinated with the power of computerized typography and explored the relationship between digital studies and rhetoric. Funded by a MITH dissertation fellowship in Spring 2010 she conducted archival research on video poetry at La Casa Totiana, Rome, and at The University of Pisa. She is currently working on her dissertation project, a comparative analysis which engages works produced by Loss Pequeno Glazier (a United States digital poet of Tejano origins) and Caterina Davinio, an Italian computer pioneer. This comparative study extends work on performance developed by theater and poetry theorists and uses its findings to investigate whether the performance of digital poetry opens up space for new and potentially more inclusive conceptions of identity."

    "person bio": "Matthew Lincoln is a PhD candidate in Art History at the University of Maryland, College Park, and inaugural recipient of the Arthur K. Wheelock Doctoral Fellowship in Northern European Art. He focuses on sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Dutch and Flemish art, with a particular concentration in the history of prints, and a methodological specialization in digitally-aided analysis. His dissertation uses computational network analysis to explore long-term changes in the organization of print designers, engravers, and publishers in the Netherlands between 1500–1700.\nDuring the 2014–2015 academic year, Matthew held the University of Maryland Museum Fellowship at the National Gallery of Art in the Department of Northern Baroque Painting. In the summer of 2015 he will be a fellow at the Harvard MetaLab workshop Beautiful Data, in addition to presenting research at the Alliance for Digital Humanities Organizations' annual international conference in Sydney. In the summer of 2014 he was selected as a Fellow for the Kress Digital Mapping and Art History Summer Institute. Previously, he was a graduate assistant for Digital Humanities at the Michelle Smith Collaboratory for Visual Culture. He has presented research at the Renaissance Society of America, the Sixteenth Century Association, and the College Art Association. [Select talks and projects can be seen on his website.](https://airtable.com/tbl6CURONRn8ML6le/viwTn1PNeQrTTNh3A/matthewlincoln.net/)\nHis MA thesis, \"Hendrick Goltzius' Protean Iconography: 1582–1590\", investigated the novel and erudite iconographies invented by the famed Dutch engraver during the crucial early years of his career.\n",

    "person bio": "Amanda Starling Gould’s work combines literary, ecocritical, and media techniques with a mindfulness of the environment to broaden our access to the material realities behind our cultural objects and representations. It is informed by the premise that, in our present Anthropocenic age defined by humans acting as a geophysical force, human bodies, cultural technologies, and the earth are intersecting material practices. Aligned with the broad scope of my research program, my dissertation, “Digital Metabolisms: Mapping a Digital Environmental Humanities,” questions the absence of environmental thinking from digital theory. In tracing the material origins of our digital technologies and wireless connections, my research makes clear that the daily use of our weightless devices is ethically-charged with heavy issues of environmental health, social justice, and ecological sustainability. It shifts the media theoretical focus from one grounded in computation to one fully planted in the earth by dispensing with standard maps of cyberspace and the social network to replace them with a digital geography of wires, workers, warehouses, and waste. Her next research and pedagogical projects consider together contemporary environmental art and literature, digital environmental rhetoric, global environmental justice, the field-based environmental studies methods of scholars like Deborah Bird Rose and Thom van Dooren, and sustainable scholarly practice. The aim is to better understand how environmental communications narrate relationships and care-practices – or the lack thereof – between the human and the environment.\n",

Her dissertation, entitled “On Black Breath: A Theory and Praxis”, takes seriously the charge of “I can’t breathe” and considers breath as more than the mere metaphor—rather, as also a somatic and sociopolitical phenomenon that has resonances in the wake of enslavement to the contemporary moment.\nKimberly is affiliated with the American Studies Program, Department of African-American Studies, and the Center for Digital Humanities.

      "Stephanie serves as a senior member of MITH's research and development team for several projects and initiatives with a targeted focus on archival, digital curation, research data, digital library, and digital stewardship activities. She has been the Principal Investigator on two subsequent NEH-sponsored grant projects about the history of educational and public radio, Unlocking the Airwaves and Broadcasting Audiovisual Data. The former project is a virtual reunification project reuniting two geographically 'split' collections; the latter connects four separate radio collections using linked data infrastructures and workflows. \nStephanie’s research revolves around using digital humanities methods alongside archival standards to reframe and contextualize historic media collections through the lens of their original production, reception, and networked distribution. She is also an affiliate faculty member of UMD's Cinema and Media Studies (CMS) department, where she teaches a course on digital storytelling using archives. As MITH’s former Project Manager, she is also interested in the stewardship of digital humanities projects and research data, including streamlining project management, documentation, and sustainability processes.\nShe has a bachelor’s degree in Film Studies and English from the University of Kansas, and a master’s degree in Moving Image Archive Studies from UCLA.\nIn the past, Stephanie was the Project Manager for the American Archive of Public Broadcasting at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, where she managed strategic operational planning for metadata and digitization initiatives. Before moving to DC in 2010, she was the Project Director on a Getty-funded grant for Los Angeles Filmforum entitled Alternative Projections: Experimental Film in LA 1945 -1980, a historical survey and preservation project resulting in over 35 new oral histories, an academic symposium, a media-rich website and database and a 16+screening exhibition series. The project was part of the Getty’s Pacific Standard Time initiative showcasing postwar art in Los Angeles. She also served as Managing Director of iotaCenter, a small nonprofit film archive of experimental film and abstract animation. Before graduate school, Stephanie worked for six years as a researcher and producer on documentaries and television shows, and specialized in finding and licensing archival footage and photos for use in productions."

Snyder** is a senior member of the Urban Simulation Team at UCLA, an associate director of the Experiential Technologies Center, and on staff with the Institute for Digital Research and Education, a division of UCLA’s Office of Information Technology. Her research is focused on the educational use of large-scale interactive computer reconstructions of historic urban environments.\nSnyder is currently working on a real-time reconstruction of the World’s Columbian Exposition held in Chicago in 1893. This work is regularly showcased at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago and appears in the documentary _Make No Little Plans: Daniel Burnham and the American City_. She is also a principal investigator on an NEH-funded project team that is developing a new interface to facilitate classroom use of interactive computer reconstructions. This run time software was designed to accommodate a range of student-centered activities and teacher-centered presentations within a framework that provides secondary scholars access to the historical evidence, methodologies, and interpretive choices that informed the creation of the virtual world.\nSnyder was the primary modeler on the interactive computer reconstructions of the Temple Mount site that were developed jointly by the Urban Simulation Team and the Israel Antiquities for the Davidson Center in the Jerusalem Archaeological Park. The Herodian version of the model was installed in 2001. The reconstruction was based on excavations conducted under the direction of archaeologist Ronny Reich and regional archaeologist Gideon Avni, and it shows visitors how excavators believe the Temple Mount appeared prior to its destruction by Roman troops in the year 70 C.E. In 2007, an expanded version of the simulation model was unveiled that includes a reconstruction of the early Islamic structures on and around the Temple Mount based on excavations at the site conducted under the direction of Jerusalem district archaeologist Yuval Baruch. Beyond the Davidson Center, this work has been featured in installations at the Gulf Coast Exploreum Science Center, the Royal Ontario Museum, the Science Museum of Minnesota, the Frankfurter Bibelgesellschaft, and the Oriental Institute Museum at the University of Chicago.\n",

Simultaneously, he is a Ph.D. candidate in the English Department at the University of Maryland studying digital humanities and postcolonial literature. \nHis dissertation, titled “Hacking the Empire: Reading the Digital in Twentieth and Twenty-First Century Postcolonial Literature,” studies hacker culture in the global south and how the hacker ethos is represented in later 20th and early 21st century postcolonial fiction under the direction of Dr. Matthew Kirschenbaum. Porter teaches classes on electronic literature and globalization and has been recognized for his contributions to the growing online teaching program in the university’s English department.\nBefore returning to graduate school, Porter worked as product manager on the United Linux initiative, an effort to create a single Linux platform shared among distributors from Germany, Brazil, the U.S., and Japan.\n",

He is particularly interested in the professionalization of this work and the diffusion of existing tools and methods into professional practice. Cal developed “[A Framework for Contextual Information in Digital Collections](http://www.ils.unc.edu/callee/p95-lee.pdf),” and edited and provided several chapters to [I, Digital: Personal Collections in the Digital Era](http://saa.archivists.org/4DCGI/store/item.html?Action=StoreItem&Item=2217&LoginPref=1) published by the Society of American Archivists.\nCal is Principal Investigator of the BitCurator project, which is developing and disseminating open-source digital forensics tools for use by archivists and librarians. He was also Principal Investigator of the Digital Acquisition Learning Laboratory (DALL) project, which investigated and tested the incorporation of digital forensics tools and methods into digital curation education. Cal has served as Co-PI on several projects focused on preparing professionals for digital curation responsibilities: Preserving Access to Our Digital Future: Building an International Digital Curation Curriculum (DigCCurr), DigCCurr II: Extending an International Digital Curation Curriculum to Doctoral Students and Practitioners; Educating Stewards of Public Information for the 21st Century (ESOPI-21), Educating Stewards of the Public Information Infrastructure (ESOPI2), and Closing the Digital Curation Gap (CDCG). In a project called Curation of a Forensic Data Collection for Education, Cal investigated and developed resources to enhance access and use of disk images to support digital forensics education.\n",

His dissertation (Near Eastern Studies, University of Michigan, 2013) explored how modern computational techniques of text analysis can be applied to the study of premodern Arabic historical sources. In particular, he studied \"The History of Islam\" (_Taʾrīḫ al-islām_), the largest of surviving biographical collections with over 30,000 biographies, written by the Damascene scholar al-Ḏahabī (d. 1348 CE). He is continuing his research and develops methods of computational analysis for other genres of premodern Arabic literature, mainly large volume collections that can offer insights into long-term and large-scale developments that took place during the pre-modern period of Islamic history. He is working on two book projects: (1) \"The History of Islam\": An Essay in Digital Humanities continues the study of al-Ḏahabī's tremendous collection of biographies, while (2) The Gift to the Knowledgeable 2.0, explores cultural production in the Islamic world until the beginning of the 20th century through the study of the _Hadiyyaŧ al-ʿārifīn_, a bibliographical collection composed by Ismāʿīl Bāšā al-Baġdādī (d. 1920). \n",

Her groundbreaking explorations across the arts, humanities, and sciences represent a novel use of methods and tools that bind research with introspective cultural production. As an artist, her work ranges from game-inspired systems to computer viruses, embodied interfaces to interactive texts; these works are exhibited internationally. As a scholar interested in how human values are in play across technologies and systems, Flanagan has written more than 20 critical essays and chapters on games, empathy, gender and digital representation, art and technology, and responsible design. Her three books in English include the recent _Critical Play_ (2009) with MIT Press. Flanagan founded the [Tiltfactor](http://www.tiltfactor.org) game research laboratory in 2003, where researchers study and make social games, urban games, and software in a rigorous theory/practice environment.

      "Stephanie serves as a senior member of MITH's research and development team for several projects and initiatives with a targeted focus on archival, digital curation, research data, digital library, and digital stewardship activities. She has been the Principal Investigator on two subsequent NEH-sponsored grant projects about the history of educational and public radio, Unlocking the Airwaves and Broadcasting Audiovisual Data. The former project is a virtual reunification project reuniting two geographically 'split' collections; the latter connects four separate radio collections using linked data infrastructures and workflows. \nStephanie’s research revolves around using digital humanities methods alongside archival standards to reframe and contextualize historic media collections through the lens of their original production, reception, and networked distribution. She is also an affiliate faculty member of UMD's Cinema and Media Studies (CMS) department, where she teaches a course on digital storytelling using archives. As MITH’s former Project Manager, she is also interested in the stewardship of digital humanities projects and research data, including streamlining project management, documentation, and sustainability processes.\nShe has a bachelor’s degree in Film Studies and English from the University of Kansas, and a master’s degree in Moving Image Archive Studies from UCLA.\nIn the past, Stephanie was the Project Manager for the American Archive of Public Broadcasting at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, where she managed strategic operational planning for metadata and digitization initiatives. Before moving to DC in 2010, she was the Project Director on a Getty-funded grant for Los Angeles Filmforum entitled Alternative Projections: Experimental Film in LA 1945 -1980, a historical survey and preservation project resulting in over 35 new oral histories, an academic symposium, a media-rich website and database and a 16+screening exhibition series. The project was part of the Getty’s Pacific Standard Time initiative showcasing postwar art in Los Angeles. She also served as Managing Director of iotaCenter, a small nonprofit film archive of experimental film and abstract animation. Before graduate school, Stephanie worked for six years as a researcher and producer on documentaries and television shows, and specialized in finding and licensing archival footage and photos for use in productions."

      "Marisa Parham is Professor of English at the University of Maryland, where she serves as director for the African American Digital Humanities initiative (AADHUM), and is the associate director for the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH). She also co-directs the Immersive Realities Lab for the Humanities, which is an independent workgroup for digital and experimental humanities (irLhumanities).\nParham’s current teaching and research projects focus on texts and technologies that problematize assumptions about time, space, and bodily materiality. She is particularly interested in how such terms share a history of increasing complexity in literary and cultural texts produced by African Americans, and how they also offer ways of thinking about intersectional approaches to digital humanities and technology studies. Recently published examples of this work include “Sample | Signal | Strobe: Haunting, Social Media, and Black Digitality,” and the interactive longform scholarly essays .break .dance, and Breaking, dancing, making in the machine. She is currently developing Black Haints in the Anthropocene, a book-length interactive project that focuses on memory, haunting, digitality, and Black environmental experience.\nParham holds a PhD in English and Comparative Literature from Columbia University, and is the author of Haunting and Displacement in African-American Literature and Culture, The African-American Student’s Guide to College, and is co-editor of Theorizing Glissant: Sites and Citations. She has also carried fellowships and residencies at the Huntington Library, The WEB DuBois Center at Harvard University, and the School for Criticism and Theory. From 2001 – 2020 she served as Professor of English, Faculty Diversity and Inclusion officer, and Mellon Mays program advisor at Amherst College, where in 2018 she was awarded the Jeffrey B. Ferguson Teaching award. She is also a former director (2013-2017) of Five College Digital Humanities, serving Amherst, Hampshire, Mt. Holyoke, and Smith Colleges, and University of Massachusetts-Amherst."

She is a core faculty member of the Consortium for Critical Diversity in a Digital Age Research (CEDAR).\nDr. Leon received her bachelor of arts in American Studies from Georgetown University in 1997 and her doctorate in American Studies from the University of Minnesota in 2004. Her first book, An Image of God: the Catholic Struggle with Eugenics, was published by the University of Chicago Press.\nPrior to joining the History Department at MSU, Dr. Leon spent over thirteen years at George Mason University’s History Department at the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media as Director of Public Projects, where she oversaw dozens of award-winning collaborations with library, museum, and archive partners from around the country.\nDr. Leon’s program of research focuses on two areas. First, she is an historian of American religion with a concentration on U.S. Catholicism. Second, she specializes in digital methods with a focus on public history. As a result, Dr. Leon often is pursuing many research tracks at once. Currently, with the support of an NEH digital publication fellowship, she is at work on a digital project to surface and analyze the community networks and experiences of the cohort of people enslaved and sold by the Maryland Province Jesuits in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries. Simultaneously, she is building a major methodological project on doing community-engaged digital public history.\nDr. Leon directs the Omeka web-publishing platform project, which provides a number of open-source options for digital scholarly communication and public engagement work: Omeka S, for linked data work and Omeka.net for a hosted solution.\nDr. Leon’s ongoing writing, projects, and teaching materials can be found at 6floors.org."

      "Marisa Parham is Professor of English at the University of Maryland, where she serves as director for the African American Digital Humanities initiative (AADHUM), and is the associate director for the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH). She also co-directs the Immersive Realities Lab for the Humanities, which is an independent workgroup for digital and experimental humanities (irLhumanities).\nParham’s current teaching and research projects focus on texts and technologies that problematize assumptions about time, space, and bodily materiality. She is particularly interested in how such terms share a history of increasing complexity in literary and cultural texts produced by African Americans, and how they also offer ways of thinking about intersectional approaches to digital humanities and technology studies. Recently published examples of this work include “Sample | Signal | Strobe: Haunting, Social Media, and Black Digitality,” and the interactive longform scholarly essays .break .dance, and Breaking, dancing, making in the machine. She is currently developing Black Haints in the Anthropocene, a book-length interactive project that focuses on memory, haunting, digitality, and Black environmental experience.\nParham holds a PhD in English and Comparative Literature from Columbia University, and is the author of Haunting and Displacement in African-American Literature and Culture, The African-American Student’s Guide to College, and is co-editor of Theorizing Glissant: Sites and Citations. She has also carried fellowships and residencies at the Huntington Library, The WEB DuBois Center at Harvard University, and the School for Criticism and Theory. From 2001 – 2020 she served as Professor of English, Faculty Diversity and Inclusion officer, and Mellon Mays program advisor at Amherst College, where in 2018 she was awarded the Jeffrey B. Ferguson Teaching award. She is also a former director (2013-2017) of Five College Digital Humanities, serving Amherst, Hampshire, Mt. Holyoke, and Smith Colleges, and University of Massachusetts-Amherst."

She is the co-author of the comic book textbook _Understanding Rhetoric: A Graphic Guide to Writing_ (Bedford/St. Martin’s, 2013) with Jonathan Alexander. She is currently working on a new monograph, tentatively entitled _Obama Online: Technology, Masculinity, and Democracy_.\nShe writes about gender and technology, the digital humanities, distance learning, connected learning, media literacy, and the rhetoric surrounding regulatory attempts to limit everyday digital practices.\nShe has written a number of frequently cited essays about communities that produce, consume, and circulate online video, videogames, digital photographs, text postings, and programming code. The diverse range of subject matter analyzed in her scholarship has included coming out videos on YouTube, videogame fan films created by immigrants, combat footage from soldiers in Iraq shot on mobile devices, video evidence created for social media sites by protesters on the Mavi Marmara, remix videos from the Arab Spring, and the use of Twitter and Facebook by Indian activists working for women’s rights after the Delhi rape case. Much of this body of work concerns the legitimation of political institutions through visual evidence, representations of war and violence in global news, and discourses about human rights. This work has appeared in edited collections from MIT Press, Routledge, University of Chicago, Minnesota, Oxford, Continuum, and many other presses.\n",

This talk is part of a larger two-book project on the representation of artificial people, such as robots, cyborgs and androids, in literature, film and philosophy. She has received a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Humanities for her current book project, The Human Machine: A Cultural History of Artificial People, which traces the history and cultural function of constructed people and animated objects from antiquity to the present.\nKakoudaki's interests include cultural studies, silent cinema, science fiction, apocalyptic narratives, and the representation of race and gender in literature and film. She has co-edited a new collection of essays on the work of Pedro Almodóvar (with Brad Epps, forthcoming from the University of Minnesota Press), and published articles on robots and cyborgs, race and melodrama in action and disaster films, body transformation and technology in early film, the political role of the pin-up in World War II, and the representation of the archive in postmodern fiction.\n",

He is interested in the stories of stylistic and cultural change these works can tell. Freedman came to Haverford in 1986 from the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned an M.A. and Ph.D in the History and Theory of Music. His most recent book, Music in the Renaissance, was published by W.W. Norton in 2012, along with a companion Anthology for Music in the Renaissance. They are ideal for intermediate and advanced courses on the period, and take their place in Norton’s new Western Music in Context series, under the editorial supervision of Walter Frisch. Sound recordings via iTunes, Amazon, and Naxos Music Library, and many readings, facsimiles, and other resources to accompany the book as well.\nThe Lost Voices Project is an electronic forum for collaboration among scholars, students, and performers. It centers on a dozen sets of music books originally printed by the Parisian press of Nicholas Du Chemin, and features facsimiles, dynamic digital editions, tools for analysis and reconstruction. This work has been made possible by major grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities (Office of Digital Humanities and Scholarly Editions Program) the American Council of Learned Societies (Digital Innovations Fellowship), as well as ongoing support from Haverford College and from the Centre d’Etudes Superieures de la Renaissance in Tours, France, the leading French institute for the study of Early Modern culture. See the links posted below.\nRichard also serves as Digital and Multimedia Scholarship editor for the Journal of the American Musicological Society, and Director of the Tri-College Digital Humanities Initiative for Haverford, Bryn Mawr, and Swarthmore Colleges.\n",

    "person bio": "**Katherine Larson** is a Professor at the University of Toronto and Chair of the Department of English at the University of Toronto Scarborough. Her research and teaching centre on sixteenth- and seventeenth-century English literature and culture, with particular interests in early modern women’s writing, gender and language, rhetoric and embodiment, and music (especially opera and song). Her first monograph, _Early Modern Women in Conversation_ (Palgrave, 2011; pbk. 2015), considers how gender shaped conversational interaction in England between 1590 and 1660. She has also co-edited two essay collections, _Re-Reading Mary Wroth_ (Palgrave, 2015) and _Gender and Song in Early Modern England_ (Ashgate, 2014; rpt. Routledge, 2016), as well as special issues of _Renaissance and Reformation_ and the _University of Toronto Quarterly_. Katherine’s articles have examined topics ranging from early modern games to the songs pervading Moulin Rouge. Her most recent book, _The Matter of Song in Early Modern England: Texts in and of the Air_ (Oxford University Press, 2019), which features a **[companion recording](https://global.oup.com/booksites/content/9780198843788/)**, situates song as a multi-dimensional form that demands to be considered in embodied, gendered, and performance-based terms.\n",

He is a Ph.D. candidate in Women’s Studies at the University of Maryland, College Park. Avery received his BA (2010) in English from the [University of Alabama](http://english.ua.edu/), Tuscaloosa, and his MA (2012) in American Studies from [the University of Kansas](http://americanstudies.ku.edu/). His work has appeared in the _Journal of Language and Sexuality_, _Critical Studies in Media Communication_, and _TSQ: Transgender Studies Quarterly_, and he served as Assistant Editor of _[AMSJ: American Studies](https://journals.ku.edu/index.php/amerstud)_ from 2010 to 2012.\nHis research interests include new media, sociolinguistics, gender and transgender studies, and discourse analysis. While at UMD, his dissertation work _Talk Amongst Yourselves: Conceptions of “Community” in Transgender Counterpublic Discourse Online, 1990 – 2014_, explores the affective and structural meanings assigned to “community” in English-language transgender discourse online. Drawing on a variety of historic and contemporary sites, he analyzes how users past and present construct “transgender community” in discourse—constructions shaped by different platform-specific affordances. His MITH project focuses on building a searchable archive of two major transgender Usenet groups, alt.transgendered and soc.support.transgender, amongst the few archival sites where the term “cisgender” is used.\nAvery’s teaching also brings his focus on technology into the classroom. He has developed student projects focused on adding coverage for underrepresented subjects and groups on Wikipedia; You can see some of his students’ pages [highlighted by the Wiki Education Foundation here](https://wikiedu.org/blog/2015/03/09/the-roundup-women-and-art-part-2/). He has also led Game Design workshops for the Design Cultures & Creativity program at UMD.\n",

His specific area of research has mostly focused on the cultural history of National Socialist Germany and its postwar impact on art and architecture. He has published a number of essays that explored the political function of architecture in the modern period, leading up to his most recent book _The Nazi Perpetrator: Postwar German Art and the Politics of the Right_ (Minnesota 2012). These interests have also led to his involvement over the past decade with the Holocaust Geography Collaborative, a coalition of 8 international scholars who specialize in both Holocaust Studies and GIS. Their research has most recently resulted in the anthology _Geographies of the Holocaust_ (2014) for which Jaskot co-authored three chapters. He is currently exploring with Anne Kelly Knowles the potential for using Historical GIS to explore issues of forced labor and the construction industry in Nazi Germany. In addition to his research, Jaskot has served as President of the College Art Association (2008–2010). \n",

Her work wrestles with the societal and ideological tensions in defining freedom within the United States south during the nineteenth century. Specifically, her investigations highlight African American efforts toward cultural and political assertion in the Great Dismal Swamp region. Her focus also includes environmental impacts resulting from the extractive industries that originated in the Great Dismal Swamp alongside the exploitation of enslaved labor. Building on the work of archaeologists, historians, and novelists, her work maps (or rather counter maps) the experiences of enslaved runaways and laborers who were exposed to the Great Dismal Swamp and the long duree of the attendant political, social and environmental costs of human/landscape resource exploitation.\n",

      "Helming from the English Department Tanya Clement's dissertation, The Making of Digital Modernism: Re-reading Modernist Texts with Computer-Assisted Analysis, is genuinely groundbreaking and will contribute new readings and new knowledge to the scholarship on Gertrude Stein as well as a lesser-known figure, the Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven (who was pivotal in the American Dadaist movement). By using a wide range of computational tools and techniques, ranging from text encoding to text mining and visualization, Clement's project is a bracing demonstration of just how completely our readings and understandings of complex literary work can be reconfigured with the intervention of new media.

There, she leads and collaborates on digital humanities projects and programming. This includes: launching a digital archive for selected recovered collections, creating metadata for postcustodial Latinx collections, organizing a digital humanities reading group with workshops, and creating the “Are We Good Neighbors?” project, which maps incidents of discrimination against Mexican Americans in Texas during the 1940s, using affidavits from the Alonso S. Perales Collection. Previously, she worked as the Americas Studies Researcher at Rice University’s Humanities Research Center on the Our Americas Archive Partnership, a digital project funded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services.\nGauthereau is the 2015 recipient of the Western Literature Association’s Louis Owens Award and her dissertation was awarded the Chair’s Prize for Best Dissertation in the English Department. Gauthereau received her PhD from Rice University in English literature. Her research interests include Chicana/o literature, Chicana feminism, affect theory, class analysis, decolonial theory, and the digital humanities. Her current book project on working-class Mexican-American literature interrogates race and class in their intersection with affect, taking into account the greater history of colonialism in the Americas.\n",

He is on the Board of Directors of the BEAM Foundation.In 1995, he was the first music producer to be accepted into the National Recording Academy based on his work in games rather than in CD’s, film, or movies.

In adopting and developing new research methods, he deliberately takes a multicultural perspective by engaging with multilingual content, facing the diverse realities of the constraints in accessing and creating digital scholarly content, and by adopting a global approach to teaching and learning.\nRaff is currently an elected member of the Text Encoding Initiative technical council and the Technical Editor of the Scholarly Editing journal."

      "Sharon M. Leon is an Associate Professor of History and Digital Humanities at Michigan State University. She is a core faculty member of the Consortium for Critical Diversity in a Digital Age Research (CEDAR).\nDr. Leon received her bachelor of arts in American Studies from Georgetown University in 1997 and her doctorate in American Studies from the University of Minnesota in 2004. Her first book, An Image of God: the Catholic Struggle with Eugenics, was published by the University of Chicago Press.\nPrior to joining the History Department at MSU, Dr. Leon spent over thirteen years at George Mason University’s History Department at the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media as Director of Public Projects, where she oversaw dozens of award-winning collaborations with library, museum, and archive partners from around the country.\nDr. Leon’s program of research focuses on two areas. First, she is an historian of American religion with a concentration on U.S. Catholicism. Second, she specializes in digital methods with a focus on public history. As a result, Dr. Leon often is pursuing many research tracks at once. Currently, with the support of an NEH digital publication fellowship, she is at work on a digital project to surface and analyze the community networks and experiences of the cohort of people enslaved and sold by the Maryland Province Jesuits in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries. Simultaneously, she is building a major methodological project on doing community-engaged digital public history.\nDr. Leon directs the Omeka web-publishing platform project, which provides a number of open-source options for digital scholarly communication and public engagement work: Omeka S, for linked data work and Omeka.net for a hosted solution.\nDr. Leon’s ongoing writing, projects, and teaching materials can be found at 6floors.org."

Prior to this, she was Visiting Curator of African and African American History & Culture at Michigan State University, building on her research focus from her tenure as a curator at the National Afro-American Museum and Cultural Center in Wilberforce, Ohio.\nBrown holds a Ph.D. in Public History form Middle Tennessee State University, a M.A. in Public History from Northern Kentucky University, and a B.S. in History from the Honors College at Coppin State University, where she was also a Ronald E. McNair Postbaccalaureate Scholar. Her research and public history practice makes interventions in the following fields: African American history, civil and human rights, women’s history, material culture, museum studies, sites of political memory, and digital humanities.\nBrown has curated exhibitions and public programs utilizing material culture as an entry point to understanding current issues with deep histories. Her most comprehensive project (as Visiting Curator of African and American History at Michigan State University Museum) is the co-curated travelling exhibition Ubuntutu: Life Legacies of Love and Action that opened at the Nelson Mandela Gateway to Robben Island in October 2016. Her co-edited exhibition catalog by the same name explores textile artists’ relationship with the legacy of Desmond Tutu in the wake of key anniversaries pertaining to civil rights legislation and South African apartheid.\nBrown is the co-founder and organizer of two acclaimed digital humanities projects. Started in 2014, #MuseumsRespondtoFerguson is both a public forum and curatorial collective. The project pushes museums to gain competencies to utilize exhibitions and collections to address state sanctioned violence. #BlkTwitterstorians is a Twitter chat designed to promote the work of Black historians. The second component involves archiving #BlkTwitterstorians related tweets, enabling researchers to trace shifts in the field wide debates through tweets. Aleia M. Brown’s scholarship has appeared, or is forthcoming in, The Black Scholar, CODE | WORDS: Technology and Theory in Museums, TIMELINE Magazine. Her popular writing has appeared in Black Perspectives, History@Work, MuseumNext, Slate, and Southern Rambles.\n",

      "Aleia M. Brown serves as the Assistant Director of the African American History, Culture and Digital Humanities (AADHum) Initiative where she co-directs the Restorative Justice Project and leads research, teaching, and programmatic initiatives. She was the recipient of the 2017-2019 Mellon-ACLS public fellowship, working as program manager at the Humanities Action Lab at Rutgers University-Newark. There she launched the multi-media installation Climates of Inequality: Stories of Environmental Justice. As Curator of African American History and Culture at the Michigan State University Museum she worked with the Desmond & Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation in Cape Town, SA to co-curate the traveling exhibition Ubuntutu: Life Legacies of Love and Action, and co-author the companion catalog. She has written and given talks on her two digital projects #BlkTwitterstorians and #MuseumsRespondtoFerguson. The desire to surface how Black folks have imagined and crafted liberation animates her exploration in un/merging material culture and virtual environments.\nHer current manuscript in progress reckons with the historic mishandling of Black women’s textile art and illuminates the sophisticated ways that makers have visualized Black political thought.\nBrown holds a Ph.D. in Public History from Middle Tennessee State University, an M.A. in Public History from Northern Kentucky University, and a B.S. in History from the Honors College at Coppin State University."

      "Mirona Magearu is a PhD Candidate in Comparative Literature at University of Maryland, College Park. She received her bachelor’s degree from The University of Bucharest, Romania, a Master’s degree in communication from The National School of Political Studies, Bucharest, and another Master’s degree in English from Emporia State University, Kansas. During her graduate studies she became fascinated with the power of computerized typography and explored the relationship between digital studies and rhetoric. Funded by a MITH dissertation fellowship in Spring 2010 she conducted archival research on video poetry at La Casa Totiana, Rome, and at The University of Pisa. She is currently working on her dissertation project, a comparative analysis which engages works produced by Loss Pequeno Glazier (a United States digital poet of Tejano origins) and Caterina Davinio, an Italian computer pioneer. This comparative study extends work on performance developed by theater and poetry theorists and uses its findings to investigate whether the performance of digital poetry opens up space for new and potentially more inclusive conceptions of identity."

    "person bio": "Dr. Balsamo is a groundbreaking national leader in media studies, a scholar and media-maker whose work links cultural studies, digital humanities, and interactive media. She received her PhD in Communications Research from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and began her faculty career in the School of Literature, Culture, and Communications at Georgia Tech, where she published a distinguished book about the cultural implications of emergent biotechnologies, Technologies of the Gendered Body: Reading Cyborg Women. In 1999, having grown interested in the practical linkages between technology and culture, she accepted an offer to join the celebrated Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), collaborating in the design of media for reading, exhibition, public art, and cultural projects. In 2003, Dr. Balsamo moved from Silicon Valley to USC, where she had been jointly appointed in the Annenberg School of Communications and the School of Cinematic Arts. She directed the Collaborative Design Lab within the Interactive Design Division of the School of Cinematic Arts. She has been a leader in the growth of digital humanities nationally, serving on the Advisory Board of HASTAC (Humanities, Arts, Science, and Technology Advanced Co-laboratory) since its founding in 2003. In 2011, she published Designing Culture: The Technological Imagination at Work, a transmedia book (with accompanying DVD and web linkages to interactive media projects) that synthesizes and theorizes the links between her cultural studies scholarship and digital media projects.\n",

    "person bio": "Beth Bonsignore is a Ph.D. student in the iSchool at the University of Maryland and a graduate research assistant on the ARG study team. Her research interests include the design and use of collaborative sense-making technologies that support lifelong literacy and learning, whether in formal education or informal contexts (museum, library, home). Specific work includes the empirical analysis of the use of mobile storytelling applications at home and in school ([StoryKit](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/storykit/id329374595?mt=8)), online communities for educators ([Classroom2.0](http://www.classroom20.com/)), social learning sites for children (National Park Services’ [WebRangers](http://www.nps.gov/webrangers/)), and the design of Alternate Reality Games as platforms for learning and collaborative-tool evaluation. As part of these efforts, she also works closely with [Kidsteam](http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/kiddesign/), a participatory design research team at the [Human-Computer Interaction Lab](http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/). Beth stumbled upon ARGs through her favorite type of leisure reading: children’s/young adult literature (and related fan-fiction). She started with transmedia works like the _[39 Clues](http://www.the39clues.com/info/about)_ series and _[Skeleton Creek](http://skeletoncreekfans.com/)_. ARG team member Kari Kraus introduced Beth to the _[Cathy’s Book](http://www.42entertainment.com/cathy.html)_ series, the _[Amanda Project](http://www.theamandaproject.com/)_, and _[Personal Effects:Dark Art](http://jchutchins.net/site/personal-effects/), _and transmedia scholar/student Marc Ruppel shared [MetaCortechs](http://www.metaurchins.org/book/home.htm), an ARG based on the [Matrix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix) universe. She became interested in the educational potential for ARGs after helping Kari and other graduate students on a mini-re-creation of their UMD-history-based mobile scavenger hunt, and while investigating the _39 Clues_ with her two sons.\n",

      "Nathan Jurgenson is a doctoral student in sociology at the University of Maryland where he is working with George Ritzer on the theoretical implications of the bottom-up turn taken by the Internet—what has come to be known as Web 2.0. His future work will involve rethinking how sociological theory (especially postmodern thought) orients our understanding of Web 2.0, and, in turn, how Web 2.0 provides fertile ground to rethink sociological theory in areas such as knowledge production, the presentation of self, consumption, authority, exploitation, and many others."

    "person bio": "Kari Kraus is an Assistant Professor in the iSchool and the Department of English at the University of Maryland. Her research and teaching interests focus on new media and the digital humanities, textual scholarship and print culture, digital preservation, transmedia storytelling, and game studies. Kraus is a local Co-PI on an Institute of Museum and Library Services grant for preserving virtual worlds; the PI on an IMLS Digital Humanities Internship grant; and, with Derek Hansen (iSchool), the Co-Principal Investigator of the NSF grant underwriting the design of AGOG. Her work has been published or is forthcoming in _The Cambridge Companion to Textual Scholarship_; _Digital Humanities Quarterly_; _Digital Media: Interdisciplinary Perspectives on History, Preservation, and Ontology; The Journal of Visual Culture_; and_ Studies in Romanticism_. She first became interested in ARGs when Marc Ruppel, a PhD student in the Department of English, introduced her to _Cathy’s Book_, billed as the first alternate reality game developed specifically for the publishing industry. In 2008, in conjunction with the University of Maryland’s Mobility Initiative, she and her graduate students designed a mobile scavenger hunt that they playtested with a group of undergraduate students who had received free iPhones and iPod Touches as part of the Provost’s pilot project. Inspired by ARGs, the on-campus hunt made use of the technological affordances of the iPhone and iTouch – e.g., camera, phone, texting, and GPS functionality – to enhance interactivity and integrate the offline and online worlds in creative ways. The narrative framework was designed to teach students about University of Maryland history, particularly the Great Fire of 1912.\n",

In adopting and developing new research methods, he deliberately takes a multicultural perspective by engaging with multilingual content, facing the diverse realities of the constraints in accessing and creating digital scholarly content, and by adopting a global approach to teaching and learning.\nRaff is currently an elected member of the Text Encoding Initiative technical council and the Technical Editor of the Scholarly Editing journal."

He is also an active member of the [Human Computer Interaction Lab](http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/). Hansen’s research focuses on the design and use of large-scale collaboration systems and social networks. He has published in places such as _The Communications of the ACM_, ACM-CHI Conference, _Computer_, _Information Research_, _Journal of Medical Internet Research_, and the _Journal of the American Medical Association_, and received funding from NSF, Microsoft Research, and several non-profits studying social media technologies. His book _Analyzing Social Media Networks with NodeXL: Insights from a_ _Connected World_ is used widely in teaching network analysis and has received excellent reviews. Hansen first became interested in alternate reality games when studying one of the largest collaborative sense-making endeavors in history: fans of the TV show _Lost_ who worked together in the millions to theorize about the complex storyline and bizarre happenings using forums, blogs, and the _Lostpedia_ wiki in novel ways.\n",

    "person bio": "Dr. Bryan Carter received his Ph.D. at the University of Missouri-Columbia and is an Associate Professor of Africana Studies at the University of Arizona, specializing in African American literature of the 20th Century with a primary focus on the Harlem Renaissance and digital culture. He has published numerous articles on his doctoral project, Virtual Harlem and has presented it at locations around the world. His research focuses on advanced visualization and how sustained and varied digital communication affects student retention and engagement in literature courses taught both online and face-to-face.\nDr. Carter's experience with virtual environments began with his dissertation project on which he began work in 1997; a 3D representation of a portion of Harlem, NY as it existed during the 1920s Jazz Age and Harlem Renaissance. This project, Virtual Harlem, was one of the earliest full virtual reality environments created for use in the humanities and certainly one of the first used in an African American literature course. Virtual Harlem has been presented at venues in Paris, The Netherlands, Sweden, Hungary, and multiple sites in the US.  In 2004, the University of Paris IV-Sorbonne, funded the development of Virtual Montmartre.  Dr. Carter was asked to be the project leader and was awarded the prestigious \"Professeur Invite\" from the Sorbonne to spend 6 months in Paris.  This project realized itself in the development of an interactive Web Site and a small 3D representation of the Lapin Agile, the oldest surviving cabaret in Montmartre which is still in operation. Since then, Dr. Carter has received a one month Professeur Invite Award from the Sorbonne a total of 12 times. The evolution of Virtual Harlem was funded in 2006 by the National Black Programming Consortium and the Government of Norway with the development of Virtual Harlem and Virtual Montmartre in Second Life. These sites were two of the most important locations during the Jazz Age/Harlem Renaissance.  Dr. Carter began teaching classes that met totally in Second Life in 2005 where his students have participated in role play, developed content and have collaborated with students from around the world. The project has evolved from Second Life to Open Simulator and Unity 3D.\nIn addition to these activities, Dr. Carter is very active with faculty development nationally and internationally. He has conducted workshops for faculty on Digital Humanities as well as specialized topics such as \"Generational Learning Styles\", \"Podcasting\", \"Blogging\", \"Internet Broadcasting\" and Second Life. He has done summer workshops for the National Council for Teachers of English on Digital Humanities, led a workshop session for the Digital Africana Studies Conference at the University of Maryland-College Park, conducted workshops on Technology in the Classroom at Alabama A&M, Tougaloo College, worked with students attending the African American Literatures and Cultures Institute at the University of Texas, San Antonio, has been an invited speaker at the HumLab at Umea University in Sweden,  and at other international venues such as Vaxjo University in Sweden and the University of Paris IV-Sorbonne.  Dr. Carter is regularly invited to venues around the world to offer keynote addresses or to serve on panels on Digital Humanities. \nIn 2015, Dr. Carter was named one of eight Technology Innovators of the year by The Chronicle of Higher Education, his work was featured in The Atlantic and Hyperallergic Magazines and the Danish newspaper, Dagbladet Information, he was one of the Keynote and Featured Speakers at Immersion 2015 hosted by the University of Paris IV-Sorbonne and organized by the Immersive Education Initiative.\n",

This includes working directly with UMD Libraries on special projects, as well as with other UMD departments and outside institutions on developing new projects and partnerships.\nStephanie’s research revolves around the intersections between digital humanities, libraries, and audiovisual archives: how archival audiovisual media objects function as primary historical documents, and what kind of digital resources and user interfaces facilitate the means for exploring that media in the context of its original production and reception. As MITH’s former Project Manager, she is also interested in the stewardship of digital humanities projects and research data, including streamlining project management, documentation, and sustainability processes.\nShe has a bachelor’s degree in Film Studies and English from the University of Kansas, and a master’s degree in Moving Image Archive Studies from UCLA.\nIn the past, Stephanie was the Project Manager for the [American Archive of Public Broadcasting](http://americanarchive.org/about-the-american-archive) at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, where she managed strategic operational planning for metadata and digitization initiatives. Before moving to DC in 2010, she was the Project Director on a Getty-funded grant for Los Angeles Filmforum entitled _[Alternative Projections: Experimental Film in LA 1945 -1980](http://www.alternativeprojections.com/)_, a historical survey and preservation project resulting in over 35 new oral histories, an academic symposium, a media-rich website and database and a 16+screening exhibition series. The project was part of the Getty’s _Pacific Standard Time_ initiative showcasing postwar art in Los Angeles. She also served as Managing Director of [iotaCenter](http://www.iotacenter.org/), a small nonprofit film archive of experimental film and abstract animation. Before graduate school, Stephanie worked for six years as a researcher and producer on documentaries and television shows, and specialized in finding and licensing archival footage and photos for use in productions.\n",

      "Stephanie serves as a senior member of MITH's research and development team for several projects and initiatives with a targeted focus on archival, digital curation, research data, digital library, and digital stewardship activities. She has been the Principal Investigator on two subsequent NEH-sponsored grant projects about the history of educational and public radio, Unlocking the Airwaves and Broadcasting Audiovisual Data. The former project is a virtual reunification project reuniting two geographically 'split' collections; the latter connects four separate radio collections using linked data infrastructures and workflows. \nStephanie’s research revolves around using digital humanities methods alongside archival standards to reframe and contextualize historic media collections through the lens of their original production, reception, and networked distribution. She is also an affiliate faculty member of UMD's Cinema and Media Studies (CMS) department, where she teaches a course on digital storytelling using archives. As MITH’s former Project Manager, she is also interested in the stewardship of digital humanities projects and research data, including streamlining project management, documentation, and sustainability processes.\nShe has a bachelor’s degree in Film Studies and English from the University of Kansas, and a master’s degree in Moving Image Archive Studies from UCLA.\nIn the past, Stephanie was the Project Manager for the American Archive of Public Broadcasting at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, where she managed strategic operational planning for metadata and digitization initiatives.

    "person bio": "Avery Dame currently serves as [MITH Winnemore Digital Dissertation Fellow](mith.umd.edu/community/fellowships/winnemore-fellows/) for 2016-2017. He is a Ph.D. candidate in Women's Studies at the University of Maryland, College Park. Avery received his BA (2010) in English from the [University of Alabama](english.ua.edu/), Tuscaloosa, and his MA (2012) in American Studies from [the University of Kansas](americanstudies.ku.edu/). His work has appeared in the _Journal of Language and Sexuality_, _Critical Studies in Media Communication_, and _TSQ: Transgender Studies Quarterly_, and he served as Assistant Editor of _[AMSJ: American Studies](https://journals.ku.edu/index.php/amerstud)_ from 2010 to 2012. His research interests include new media, sociolinguistics, gender and transgender studies, and discourse analysis. While at UMD, his dissertation work _Talk Amongst Yourselves: Conceptions of \"Community\" in Transgender Counterpublic Discourse Online, 1990 -- 2014_, explores the affective and structural meanings assigned to \"community\" in English-language transgender discourse online. Drawing on a variety of historic and contemporary sites, he analyzes how users past and present construct \"transgender community\" in discourse---constructions shaped by different platform-specific affordances. His MITH project focuses on building a searchable archive of two major transgender Usenet groups, alt.transgendered and soc.support.transgender, amongst the few archival sites where the term \"cisgender\" is used. Avery's teaching also brings his focus on technology into the classroom. He has developed student projects focused on adding coverage for underrepresented subjects and groups on Wikipedia; You can see some of his students' pages [highlighted by the Wiki Education Foundation here](https://wikiedu.orgblog/2015/03/09/the-roundup-women-and-art-part-2/). He has also led Game Design workshops for the Design Cultures & Creativity program at UMD. \n",
