    "description": "MITH hosted the first annual Digital Humanities Winter Institute (DHWI), from Monday, January 7, 2013, to Friday, January 11, 2013, at the University of Maryland in College Park, Maryland. We were delighted to be expanding the model pioneered by the highly-successful Digital Humanities Summer Institute ([DHSI](http://www.dhsi.org/)) at the University of Victoria to the United States.\nDHWI provided an opportunity for scholars to learn new skills relevant to different kinds of digital scholarship while mingling with like-minded colleagues in coursework, social events, and lectures during an intensive, week-long event located amid the many attractions of the Washington, D.C. region.\nCourses were open to all skill levels and catered to many different interests. For the 2013 Institute we assembled an amazing group of instructors who taught everything from introductory courses on project development and programming, to intermediate level courses on image analysis, teaching with multimedia, and data curation. DHWI also featured more technically-advanced courses on text analysis and linked open data. Our goal was that the curricula we assembled would appeal to graduate students, faculty, librarians, and museum professionals as well as participants from government and non-governmental organizations.\nAn exciting program of extracurricular events accompanied the formal DHWI courses to capitalize on the Institute’s proximity to the many cultural heritage organizations in the region. This stream of activities, which we called “DHWI Public Digital Humanities,” included an API workshop, a hack-a-thon, and opportunities to contribute videos and other materials to the [4Humanities](http://humanistica.ualberta.ca/) campaign to document the importance of the humanities for contemporary society.\nBoth the outward-looking DHWI Public Digital Humanities program and the week of high-caliber, in-depth digital humanities coursework were kicked off by the Institute Lecture. This year’s speaker was Seb Chan, Director of Digital & Emerging Media at the Smithsonian, Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum in New York City.\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\nPlease note that beginning in 2014, DHWI became [Humanities Intensive Learning + Teaching](http://mith.umd.edu/community/dh-events/event/hilt-2014/). A limited subsection of the [original DHWI site](http://web.archive.org/web/20130304142829/http://mith.umd.edu/dhwi) is still available as archived on the Wayback Machine.\n",

This stream of activities, which we called “DHWI Public Digital Humanities,” included an API workshop, a hack-a-thon, and opportunities to contribute videos and other materials to the [4Humanities](http://humanistica.ualberta.ca/) campaign to document the importance of the humanities for contemporary society.\nBoth the outward-looking DHWI Public Digital Humanities program and the week of high-caliber, in-depth digital humanities coursework were kicked off by the Institute Lecture. This year’s speaker was Seb Chan, Director of Digital & Emerging Media at the Smithsonian, Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum in New York City.\n",

    "description": "[Early Modern Songscapes](http://songscapes.org) is a project exploring the circulation and performance of English Renaissance poetry. The recently released beta version of the project’s site includes a digital exploration of Henry Lawes’s 1653 songbook _Ayres and Dialogues_. The project is a collaboration between the University of Toronto (UoT), the University of Maryland (UMD), and the University of South Carolina (USC). My role (Raff Viglianti) at MITH for this first exploratory phase has focused on designing a data model and an online viewer for the text and musical score of the songs. Prof. Scott Trudell (UMD) and Prof. Sarah Williams (USC) have contributed to shaping the data model and have carried out the encoding work so far.\n",

        "description": "The Early Modern Songscapes platform was launched at a two-day international symposium held 8-9 February 2019 at the University of Toronto’s Centre for Reformation and Renaissance Studies in Toronto, Canada.  \nThe conference attracted nearly 70 participants from around the world, and the rich array of papers (several of which got the audience singing!) and related performances prompted generative conversations about the artistic-scholarly interface that work on song necessitates as well as laying important foundations for further collaborative work in the field. Featured keynote speakers included Patricia Fumerton (University of California, Santa Barbara), Whitney Trettien (University of Pennsylvania), and Amanda Eubanks Winkler (Syracuse University). The conference also included an introductory digital humanities workshop on TEI/MEI and a public recital of songs featuring selections from Henry Lawes’s _Ayres and Dialogues_ (1653), performed by Rebecca Claborn (mezzo-soprano), Lawrence Wiliford (tenor), and Lucas Harris (lute). \nVideo recordings of the three plenary sessions can be accessed below. Audio recordings of the recital performances are also available below through the link to the full conference archive that has been preserved in the EMS repository.\n",

The focal point of our inquiry is the so-called \"imitation\" Mass, a Renaissance musical genre notable for the ways in which its composers derived new, large-scale works from pre-existing ones. This rich weave of relationships seems particularly suited to the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) XML standard that serves as the basis of our digital editions, and for the enhanced capabilities of addressing scores with pinpoint accuracy developed during two recent projects supported by the NEH, The [Lost Voices Project](http://digitalduchemin.org/) (2010--2014) and MITH's [Enhancing Music Notation Addressability](../enhancing-music-notation-addressability/index.html) (2014--2015). We will extend addressability to various para-texts that give meaning to the musical citations themselves via a participatory multi-author publication system using Linked Open Data technologies such as the [Web Annotation Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/) and [Nanopublications](http://nanopub.org/wordpress/).\n",

    "description": "This web-based language learning project is alternately referred to as _Development of Russian Language Modules to Support Differentiated Learning and Generate Empirical Data on Student Performance_. It was developed by 2001 MITH Faculty Fellow, Professor Maria Lekic from Asian and East European Languages and Cultures.\nThe project involved the teaching and analysis of adult foreign language acquisition within relatively unscripted naturalistic settings through the design of computerized modules for individual or classroom involving specialized vocabularies (such as Russian for business use, space science, etc.). Working with MITH’s programmer and technical staff at the American Councils for International Education (ACTR), Dr. Lekic developed a testbed of interactive tools that substantially advance language acquisition online tutorials.\nThe Business Russian project initially developed fourteen Internet-accessible Russian language learning modules- four beginner-level modules, six intermediate-level modules, and four advanced-level module – plus a module on the Cyrillic alphabet. The modules could be used as a complement to a standard second or third-year Russian course or as stand-alone one-semester courses in Business Russian. The web-based Business Russian Modules included sets of self-paced practice activities that developed what are referred to in the literature as the “enabling skills” of grammar and vocabulary. These relied, in turn, on two basic texts, one written and one oral, which enhance reading and listening proficiency.\nAll of Lekic’s activities on the Business Russian project before, during and after her fellowship led to the formation of Russnet, a Russian-Language field resource center which provides Russian-language learning services and products – information, language modules, courses, materials, in-service teacher training, databases, discussion forums, and gateways to other Russian language resources.\n",

    "description": "The DISC website was a MITH Fellowship project of Rosemarie Garland-Thomson. Rosemarie is a renowned scholar in what is now a very established Disability Studies field, and the DISC project was an outgrowth of her very early work starting in the mid-90’s attempting to establish this as a legitimate academic field of study. The DISC site was an international, interdisciplinary, user-generated, digital forum providing support, collegial networks, and information that sustains a disability studies academic community and promotes disability studies in a humanities focus. DISC was in part built by the disability studies community through crowdsourced contributions of information.\nSite components included resources such as syllabi and speakers banks, a directory of scholars, publishing and job/grant opportunities, and directory of Disability Studies programs. It also included a searchable archive for the DS-HUM list serv, information on disability legislation, links to professional organizations, museums and exhibits.\n",

    "description": "Popular understanding of the Internet's physical reality has changed dramatically in the past half-decade, with consequences for privacy and security. Drawing on the research in his book, \"Tubes: A Journey to the Center of the Internet,\" Blum will argue for a continued emphasis on the Internet's real-world geography.\n**Andrew Blum** is a journalist and the author of _Tubes: A Journey to the Center of the Internet_, the first book-length look at the physical heart of the Internet itself. _Tubes_ was first published in June 2012 by Ecco/Harpercollins in the US and Viking/Penguin in the UK. It was a national bestseller, and met with wide acclaim from _The New York Times_, _The Wall Street Journal_, _The Boston Globe_, _Salon_, _The Guardian_, _The Economist, The Independent, Kirkus Reviews, Bookforum, Scientific American, New Scientist, Brain Pickings, Ars Technica, Science News_ and many others. Blum discussed _Tubes_ with Terry Gross on NPR's _Fresh Air_; BBC 4 presented it as a \"Book of the Week\"; and Blum spoke about his research on the stages of TED Global and the London School of Economics, among dozens of other venues. Design Observer named Tubes its 2012 \"Book of the Year,\" and London's Independent called it \"The year's most stimulating and original 'travel' book.\" When the Edward Snowden/NSA revelations made the Internet's infrastructure a vital diplomatic question, journalists from Washington to London to Frankfurt to São Paulo relied on _Tubes_ as a crucial reference. It has been translated into nine languages.\n_Co-Sponsored by Design | Cultures + Creativity and the Department of American Studies_\n",

        "description": "Popular understanding of the Internet's physical reality has changed dramatically in the past half-decade, with consequences for privacy and security. Drawing on the research in his book, \"Tubes: A Journey to the Center of the Internet,\" Blum will argue for a continued emphasis on the Internet's real-world geography. \n**Andrew Blum** is a journalist and the author of _Tubes: A Journey to the Center of the Internet_, the first book-length look at the physical heart of the Internet itself. _Tubes_ was first published in June 2012 by Ecco/Harpercollins in the US and Viking/Penguin in the UK. It was a national bestseller, and met with wide acclaim from _The New York Times_, _The Wall Street Journal_, _The Boston Globe_, _Salon_, _The Guardian_, _The Economist, The Independent, Kirkus Reviews, Bookforum, Scientific American, New Scientist, Brain Pickings, Ars Technica, Science News_ and many others. Blum discussed _Tubes_ with Terry Gross on NPR's _Fresh Air_; BBC 4 presented it as a \"Book of the Week\"; and Blum spoke about his research on the stages of TED Global and the London School of Economics, among dozens of other venues. Design Observer named Tubes its 2012 \"Book of the Year,\" and London's Independent called it \"The year's most stimulating and original 'travel' book.\" When the Edward Snowden/NSA revelations made the Internet's infrastructure a vital diplomatic question, journalists from Washington to London to Frankfurt to São Paulo relied on _Tubes_ as a crucial reference. It has been translated into nine languages. \n_Co-Sponsored by Design | Cultures + Creativity and the Department of American Studies_ \n",

    "description": "The documentary was a project of 2003-04 MITH Fellow Regina Harrison. It depicts miners in Potosi, Bolivia, who extract silver, zinc, and lead from the mountain in the same precarious conditions as their ancestors did five centuries ago. Tourist agencies and transnational mining companies promise to bring in additional revenue for the miners, but it is apparent that the ‘rich’ mountain is dying.\nFor this work Harrison received the Latin American Studies Association 2006 “Award of Merit in Film,” which is given for “excellence in the visual presentation of educational and artistic materials on Latin America.” Harrison is also the recipient of book awards from the Modern Language Association and the Latin American Studies Association.\nThe project was filmed with the MITH Canon GL1 digital camera in 2003 and 2004, but the 2004 digital cassettes were stolen in Bolivia after three weeks of filming. Despite this setback, she then bought her own Canon GL2 to return to the labyrinth of mine tunnels to film again in 2005. Harrison, as a MITH fellow, received training in film technique from MITH fellow April Householder and from MITH Advisory Board member Irvin Kershner. Campus funding from CAPA, MITH, and ARHU DRI funds, as well as maintenance funds from Fulbright-Hays, helped defray the costs of several years of travel, filming, and editing.\n",

        "talk title": "\"Mined to Death\"",
        "description": "Produced, scripted, and filmed by Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) Fellow Regina Harrison who will lead a discussion after the screening, this 40 minute documentary with Spanish subtitles--which also exists in a Spanish version titled \"Mina adentro\" (with English subtitles)--depicts miners in Potosi, Bolivia, who extract silver, zinc, and lead from the mountain in the same precarious conditions as their ancestors did five centuries ago. Tourist agencies and transnational mining companies promise to bring in additional revenue for the miners, because the \"rich\" mountain is dying. \nFor this work Harrison received the Latin American Studies Association 2006 \"Award of Merit in Film,\" which is given for \"excellence in the visual presentation of educational and artistic materials on Latin America.\" Harrison is also the recipient of book awards from the Modern Language Association and the Latin American Studies Association. This is her first award for film. The project was filmed with the MITH Canon GL1 digital camera in 2003 and 2004, but the 2004 digital cassettes were stolen in Bolivia after three weeks of filming. Despite this setback, she then bought her own Canon GL2 to return to the labyrinth of mine tunnels to film again in 2005. Harrison, as a MITH fellow, received training in film technique from MITH fellow April Householder and from MITH Advisory Board member Irvin Kershner. Campus funding from CAPA, MITH, and ARHU DRI funds, as well as maintenance funds from Fulbright-Hays, helped defray the costs of several years of travel, filming, and editing.\n",

        "description": "Awarded via a National Endowment for the Humanities Chairman’s Cooperative Agreement, Shared Horizons: Data, BioMedicine, and the Digital Humanities will explore collaboration, research methodologies, and the interpretation of evidence arising from the interdisciplinary opportunities in this burgeoning area of biomedical-driven humanities scholarship.\nShared Horizons will create opportunities for disciplinary cross-fertilization through a mix of formal and informal presentations combined with breakout sessions, all designed to promote a rich exchange of ideas about how large-scale quantitative methods can lead to new understandings of human culture. Bringing together researchers from the digital humanities and bioinformatics communities, the symposium will explore ways in which these two communities might fruitfully collaborate on projects that bridge the humanities and medicine around the topics of sequence alignment and network analysis, two modes of analysis that intersect with “big data.”\nThis Welcome Reception will be hosted by the British Deputy Head of Mission, Mr. Philip Barton and the Research Councils UK\n",

        "description": "The [Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities](http://mith.umd.edu)** **(MITH), working in cooperation with the [Office of Digital Humanities](http://www.neh.gov/divisions/odh) of the [National Endowment for the Humanities](http://www.neh.gov), the [National Library of Medicine](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/) of the [National Institutes for Health](http://www.nih.gov), and the [Research Councils UK](http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/Pages/Home.aspx), will host a two-day symposium to: (1) address questions about collaboration, research methodologies, and the interpretation of evidence arising from the interdisciplinary opportunities in this burgeoning area of biomedical-driven humanities scholarship; (2) to investigate the current state of the field; and (3) to facilitate future research collaborations between the humanities and biomedical sciences.\nAwarded via a National Endowment for the Humanities Chairman’s Cooperative Agreement, Shared Horizons: Data, BioMedicine, and the Digital Humanities will explore collaboration, research methodologies, and the interpretation of evidence arising from the interdisciplinary opportunities in this burgeoning area of biomedical-driven humanities scholarship.\nShared Horizons will create opportunities for disciplinary cross-fertilization through a mix of formal and informal presentations combined with breakout sessions, all designed to promote a rich exchange of ideas about how large-scale quantitative methods can lead to new understandings of human culture. Bringing together researchers from the digital humanities and bioinformatics communities, the symposium will explore ways in which these two communities might fruitfully collaborate on projects that bridge the humanities and medicine around the topics of sequence alignment and network analysis, two modes of analysis that intersect with “big data.”\n",

    "description": "Funded by two consecutive grants from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, Project Bamboo is a partnership of ten research universities building shared infrastructure for humanities research. Led by University of California, Berkeley, the project includes Australian National University; Indiana University; Northwestern University; Tufts University; University of Chicago; University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; University of Maryland; University of Oxford; and University of Wisconsin-Madison. Within Bamboo, MITH is leading Corpora Space. We are designing research environments where scholars may discover, analyze and curate digital texts across the 450 years of print culture in English from 1473 until 1923, along with the texts from the Classical world upon which that print culture is based. We are initially focusing on the following collections: AUSTLit; Nineteenth-century Scholarship Online (NINES); Google Books; HathiTrust; Oxford Text Archive; Perseus Digital Library; and Text Creation Partnership of Early English Books Online (EEBO) and Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO).\n",

    "description": "Topic Modeling for Humanities Research was a unique opportunity for cross-fertilization, information exchange, and collaboration between and among humanities scholars and researchers in natural language processing on the subject of topic modeling applications and methods. The workshop was organized into three primary areas:\n1. an overview of how topic modeling is currently being used in the humanities;\n2. an inventory of topic modeling methods that have particular relevance for humanities research questions; and\n3. a discussion of software implementations, toolkits, and applications.\nThe workshop was designed to foster collaboration between these communities by providing humanities scholars with a deeper understanding of latent variable modeling methods (and best practices for their interpretation), and by articulating fundamental literary and historical questions for researchers outside of the humanities who are developing the models and methods. The organizers encouraged applications from faculty, staff, and graduate students, as well as other academics and members of the general public with a serious interest in natural language processing, topic modeling, and the literary and historical questions that intersect with these research areas. Confirmed speakers include: Matthew Jockers of the University of Nebraska, David Mimno of Princeton University, Rob Nelson of the University of Richmond, Jordan Boyd-Graber of the University of Maryland, and more.\n",

        "description": "Topic Modeling for Humanities Research, a one-day workshop directed by Assistant Director of MITH Dr. Jennifer Guiliano, received a Level 1 Digital Humanities start up from the National Endowment for the Humanities on April 19, 2011. The workshop will facilitate a unique opportunity for cross-fertilization, information exchange, and collaboration between and among humanities scholars and researchers in natural language processing on the subject of topic modeling applications and methods. The workshop will be organized into three primary areas: 1) an overview of how topic modeling is currently being used in the humanities; 2) an inventory of extensions of the LDA model that have particular relevance for humanities research questions; and 3) a discussion of software implementations, toolkits, and interfaces.\nDespite—or perhaps because of—the relatively widespread use of topic modeling for text analysis in the digital humanities, it is common to find examples of misapplication and misinterpretation of the technique and its output. There are a number of reasons for this: existing software packages generally have a significant learning curve, most humanists do not have a clear understanding of the underlying statistical methods and models, and there is still limited documentation of best practices for the application of the methods to humanities research questions. As a result, the most promising work in topic modeling is being done not by humanists exploring literary or historical corpora but instead by scholars working in natural language processing and information retrieval.\nThis workshop will address these issues by providing an opportunity for humanists and scholars working in natural language processing jointly to identify potential areas of research and development within applications, extensions, and implementation of topic modeling. Topic Modeling in the Humanities will provide humanities scholars with a deeper understanding of the vocabulary of LDA topic modeling (and other latent variable modeling methods) and best practices for interpreting the output of such analysis, and will articulate fundamental literary and historical questions for researchers outside of the humanities who are developing the models and methods (as well as the software implementations).\n",

    "description": "The Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities and the Theatre Department at the University of Maryland in College Park worked together in 2009-10 to create CAMP, a Collaborative, Ajax-Based, Modeling Platform. As the name suggests, this tool is an open source, collaborative, 3-dimensional modeler that will allow users with very little experience to generate a 3-dimensional model in their web browser which they can then allow other users to both view and edit. The tool was initially used to construct an international database of pre-nineteenth century theater buildings, but was designed to be intentionally generic so that scholars interested in structures of any sort can easily port it into their own projects.\nCAMP is innovative in its web-based, collaborative approach to 3-dimensional modeling, a difficult activity for which there are few tools in or outside of the digital humanities. Until about ten years ago, the average home computer could only process multimedia files relatively slowly, and file sizes and bandwidth speeds prevented the web from being a feasible platform for working with anything other than text and small images. These technical constraints have now largely vanished; however, work in the digital humanities has yet to catch up with the technical possibilities. The digital humanities remain a largely text-centric field in which most of the largest and best-funded projects in are still those for which a text, usually a significant literary or historical text, is paramount.\n",

    "description": "Digital Humanities 2009—the annual joint meeting of the Association for Computers and the Humanities, the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing, and the Society for Digital Humanities / Société pour l’étude des médias interactifs—was hosted by the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) at the University of Maryland in College Park.\nCoinciding with MITH’s 10th anniversary as a working digital humanities center, we were thrilled to have welcomed this distinguished international community to a campus that has fostered numerous early adopter projects in the field and which continues to innovate with new work on tools, text analysis, electronic editing, virtual worlds, digital preservation, and cyberinfrastructure. As a setting for digital humanities research, MITH also enjoys unusually close relationships with the campus’s iSchool or Information School, the Human-Computer Interaction Lab (the oldest of its kind), and the University Libraries, all of whom were co-sponsors of the conference.\nThe University of Maryland as a conference site put attendees within arm’s length of the capital of the United States and all its cultural institutions (including the Smithsonian, the Library of Congress, the Folger Shakespeare Library, and the Kennedy Center), countless dining options and cuisines from around the globe, and the nearby waterfronts of the Chesapeake Bay, Annapolis, and the city of Baltimore.\nExcursions and activities took full advantage of the wealth of opportunity the area provides, with special tours of the Smithsonian’s vaults or the National Archives, time on the National Mall, and a trip to the Air and Space museum’s recently opened Udvar-Hazy Center near Dulles International Airport (whose exhibits include the Space Shuttle Enterprise).\n",

    "description": "Music Theatre Online, based at the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities, is a digital archive of texts, images, video, and audio files relating to musical theater. The best printed editions of musical theater texts cannot fully provide the experience of simultaneous expression of verbal, musical, and terpsichorean languages so necessary to fully understand the art form. Using the multimedia capabilities of the modern web browser, we created a better framework for studying these important works of drama.\nThe initial phase of the project was funded by a Scholarly Editions Grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). In the first year of the project we constructed the web interface and completed work on our first title, the 2008 musical _Glory Days_. In Spring 2011, we received a grant from the Access to Artistic Excellence program of the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) to continue the work begun under the NEH-Startup grant. Each month the project team is posting a libretto of an important early American musical in a variety of formats and supplementing it with associated photographs, vocal scores, and the occasional audio file.\nThe _Glory Days_ material is used with the kind permission of James Gardiner and Nick Blaemire.\n",

Elizabeth Abele, who at that time was a PhD candidate at Temple University, and who worked with MITH to enhance the web version of the _Schuylkill Graduate Journal_. Created by English graduate students at Temple University in January 1997, _Schuylkill Graduate Journal_ is an interdisciplinary graduate journal designed to enhance Confidence; Community; and Curriculum vitae. In addition to publishing graduate work, Schuylkill has worked to train graduate students as readers, editors, and administrators.

    "description": "Open Annotation Collaboration (OAC) was a project funded by the Mellon Foundation in three distinct phases between 2009 and 2013. It was primarily led by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, with several other partnerships including MITH, University of Queensland, Los Alamos National Laboratory Research Library, and the Office of Advanced Technology Research at JSTOR. Details on what was accomplished in each phase are available on the project website:\n-   [Phase I (July 2009 -- December 2010)](http://www.openannotation.org/phaseI.html)\n-   [Phase II (January 2011 -- February 2013)](http://www.openannotation.org/phaseII.html)\n-   [Phase III (January 2013 -- September 2013)](http://www.openannotation.org/phaseIII.html)\nAnnotating is a pervasive element of scholarly practice for both the humanist and the scientist. It is a method by which scholars organize existing knowledge and facilitate the creation and sharing of new knowledge. It is used by individual scholars when reading as an aid to memory, to add commentary, and to classify. It can facilitate shared editing, scholarly collaboration, and pedagogy. Over time annotations can have scholarly value in their own right. Yet scholars remain dissatisfied with the options available for annotating digital resources. Scholars wanting to annotate have to learn different annotation clients for different content repositories, have no easy way to integrate annotations made on different systems or created by colleagues using other tools, and are often limited to simplistic and constrained models of annotation. The importance of annotating as a scholarly practice coupled with the real-world limitations of existing practices and tools supporting annotation of digital content has had a retarding effect on the growth of digital scholarship and the level of digital resource use by scholars.\nThe overarching goals of this project (consisting of multiple phases) are:\n1. To facilitate the emergence of a Web and Resource-centric interoperable annotation environment that allows leveraging annotations across the boundaries of annotation clients, annotation servers, and content collections. To this end, interoperability specifications will be devised.\n2. To demonstrate through implementations an interoperable annotation environment enabled by the interoperability specifications in settings characterized by a variety of annotation client/server environments, content collections, and scholarly use cases.\n3. To seed widespread adoption by deploying robust, production-quality applications conformant with the interoperable annotation environment in ubiquitous and specialized services, tools, and content used by scholars -- e.g.: Zotero, AXE, LORE, Co-Annotea, Pliny; JSTOR, AustLit, MONK.\n",

    "description": "This site was constructed with the goal of incorporating Japanese women into the history of the Occupation period, 1945-1952, immediately following Japan's defeat in World War II. It looks at a broad range of activities and draws upon a wide variety of sources. In embracing gender as a vital but neglected means of approach, it also encompasses class and race. Oku Mumeo, whose figure appears on the home page, was a prominent political and social activist from the 1920s to 1945 and won a seat in the Upper House in the first election under the new Constitution of 1947. She also helped to create and lead the Housewives League of 1948 and is sometimes considered to be the founder of Japan's postwar consumer movement. Her name, her achievements, and her philosophy of kitchen politics appear nowhere in early or recent standard histories, although Oku has been rediscovered in women's histories. Yet, even with the advent of women's history in Japan and the rise of feminist consciousness, Japanese women's magazines, newsletters, networks, and creativity in art, drama, and literature, not to mention resilience in daily survival, remain a huge source for study, discourse, and revelation. Another goal in making this site is to encourage research in gender topics and enhance undergraduate studies on Japan across all disciplines from the humanities to the social sciences and sciences.\n\n_Due to rights restrictions, the content for this project can no longer be made publicly available.

    "description": "2018 marks the 200th anniversary of the publication of Mary Shelley's _Frankenstein_, a seminal literary work that, since its appearance, has influenced millions of people across the globe. _Frankenstein_ is a rare work of fiction in that it appeals to both novice and expert readers alike, readers who represent both the breadth of human diversity and a range of disciplinary interests and backgrounds. It is a work that remains relevant to contemporary cultural debates concerning issues ranging from biomedical technologies and the ethical questions they raise to misperceptions and misrepresentations of the Other and their impact on our shared humanity. _Frankenstein_ sparks imagination and critical thinking about the human experience, and thus it is perhaps no surprise that it is the most widely taught literary text in the country and the fifth most widely taught book from any discipline.\nTo commemorate the bicentennial of the novel and also to harness its power to generate and inspire communities of readers, the [Keats-Shelley Association of America](http://k-saa.org/) in partnership with the [National Endowment for the Humanities](https://www.neh.gov/) is launching \"Frankenreads\": a \"Bloomsday\"-style, national/international public reading of _Frankenstein_ on October 31, 2018. We hope to:\n- engage an international community, including but not limited to North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia Pacific in related activities centering on the novel;\n- to make this community visible globally as a community through shared branding and social media;\n- to livestream a public reading of _Frankenstein_ to be held at NEH headquarters for those around the world who are unable to attend one in person;\n- to facilitate bringing regional experts of the novel to such events as lectures, discussions, and film showings held at local libraries and community centers;\n- to hold in the days leading up to [Frankenreads](http://frankenreads.org) an international \"Week of _Frankenstein_,\" during which students, teachers, and the public could hold _Frankenstein_ related events and contribute their thoughts, images, and short videos about _Frankenstein_ to a collective blog.\nWe invite you to discover already planned events near you, or to join our growing list of partners by proposing your own!\n",

    "description": "The Early Americas Digital Archive (EADA) is a collection of electronic texts and links to texts originally written in or about the Americas from 1492 to approximately 1820. Open to the public for research and teaching purposes, EADA was published and supported by the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) under the general editorship of Professor Ralph Bauer, at the University of Maryland at College Park. Intended as a long-term and inter-disciplinary project committed to exploring the intersections between traditional humanities research and digital technologies, it invited scholars from all disciplines to submit their editions of early American texts for publication on this site.\nIn the EADA Database, you can find texts that are housed at EADA itself and that have been encoded using TEI, which makes it possible for you to search for specific terms, such as author, title, and subject, within and across the texts. EADA vouches for the accuracy of the header information as well as for the authenticity and quality of the texts contained in its database, which is continually and gradually expanding. If you do not find the early American text you are looking for in the EADA database, you may also consult the “Gateway to Early American Authors on the WEB,” which allows you to browse a list of early American authors whose texts are available both on sites that others have posted on the World Wide Web as well as texts from this site, the Early Americas Digital Archive. Texts external to the EADA Database cannot be searched with the EADA Search Engine; nor can EADA vouch for the authenticity or quality of any of the texts external to its database and referred to in the Gateway.\n",

Collaborative in nature, RCCS sought to support ongoing conversations about the emerging field, to foster a community of students, teachers, scholars, explorers, and builders of cyberculture, and to showcase various models, works-in-progress, and on-line projects.\n[As of 2002](https://web.archive.org/web/20020206011555/http://www.com.washington.edu/rccs/), the site contained a collection of scholarly resources, including university-level courses in cyberculture, events and conferences, an extensive annotated bibliography, and two full-length book reviews each month. During the 1998-1999 academic year, RCCS sponsored the Cyberculture Working Group, a collection of University of Maryland and neighboring graduate students and faculty members from across the disciplines interested in exploring cyberculture through a series of symposia, workshops, and community service projects.\nRCCS was originally founded by David Silver in 1996 at UMD, and became part of a MITH Networked Associate Fellowship awarded to Silver in 2000-2001. The project also received generous support from the Department of American Studies.\n",

A cross-Atlantic collaboration has produced an interactive interface for the detailed study of these geographically distant quartos, with full functionality for all thirty-two quarto copies of Hamlet held by participating institutions.\nToday, six institutions in the United Kingdom and United States stand out as the main repositories of the pre-1642 quartos: the Bodleian Library of the University of Oxford, the British Library, the University of Edinburgh Library, the Folger Shakespeare Library, the Huntington Library, and the National Library of Scotland. The Shakespeare Quartos Archive has been established as the result of joint support from the US National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), and the UK Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC). Through this international collaboration, many of the earliest Shakespeare quartos are now freely available for in-depth study to students of Shakespeare across the globe.\n",

        "description": "Many of you will have seen the news about MITH's most recent grant activity, a new NEH/JISC funded project on digitizing Shakespeare's Quartos undertaken in collaboration with the Folger Shakespeare Library, the British Library, the Bodleian at Oxford, and various other prestigious institutions. More detail is available [here](http://www.newsdesk.umd.edu/culture/release.cfm?ArticleID=1620). \nThe nearly $120,000 NEH grant will provide initial funds for one year to create a technical proof of concept \"working model\" for the project by digitizing all 32 pre-1641 versions of Hamlet held by the participating libraries. \"The JISC/NEH initiative gave us the opportunity and the incentive to attempt a truly international, collaborative, digital project,\" says Folger Project Director RICHARD KUHTA. \"The guidelines challenged us to think collectively about what was possible, and to realize a shared ambition. It was exactly the prompt we needed to launch a conversation that transformed geographically distant collections into partner institutions.\" NEIL FRAISTAT adds, \"We are proud to have as partners such institutions as the Folger Shakespeare Library, the Huntington Library, the British Library, and the Bodleian Library of Oxford University. This grant caps what has been an extraordinary year for MITH, in which it has received five major grants, covering the gamut from Shakespeare's Quartos to the preservation of Virtual Worlds.\" \nIn this Digital Dialogue, we will introduce the project to the university community, solicit initial feedback, and discuss ways to involve interested constituents as our work progresses. The discussion will be led by NEIL FRAISTAT (Professor of English and Director, MITH), JIM KUHN (Head of Collection Information Services, Folger), RICHARD KHUTA (Librarian, Folger), and DOUG RESIDE (Assistant Director, MITH).\n",

    "description": "Within Project Bamboo, The Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) led Corpora Space, which allows scholars to work at the cutting edge of digital humanities and textual analysis research. In Corpora Space, scholars can discover, analyze and curate digital texts across the 450 years of print culture in English from 1473 until 1923, along with the texts from the Classical world upon which that print culture is based. The initial focus was on the following collections: AUSTLit; Nineteenth-century Scholarship Online (NINES); Google Books; HathiTrust; Oxford Text Archive; Perseus Digital Library; and Text Creation Partnership of Early English Books Online (EEBO) and Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO).\nAs part of the design phase, Corpora Space held a series of workshops. The first meeting between Bamboo and Google gave Corpora Space partners insight into Google’s design principles and process. The second workshop brought together software developers and scholars for a three-day CorporaCamp at MITH. Over the course of the three days, participants successfully built the Woodchipper, a prototype application for exploring distributed, large-scale collections through visualizations supported by techniques from data mining and natural language processing. The Woodchipper was tested across large subsets—up to several hundred million words — of the HathiTrust Digital Library, EEBO-TCP and ECCO-TCP, and the Perseus Digital Library. It allows users to build collections of texts from across these sources and to explore these collections by mapping them in a two-dimensional thematic space.\nMITH held ToolMixer, the third workshop in the Corpora Space Design process, on June 6-7, 2011. Tool builders, scholars, and members of Project Bamboo met to work on key issues related to connecting tools and architecture to digital collections. Project Bamboo partners were joined by representatives of the Scholars’ Lab at the University of Virginia, NINES and 18thConnect, HathiTrust Research Center, SEASR, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and University of California Riverside to hear presentations from tool builders and plan how tools would connect to the Corpora Space infrastructure. Additionally, we conducted break-out sessions to discuss how the various tools would link together in a scholarly workflow. This workshop brought us significantly closer to finalizing decisions about the core set of tools to be included in the initial implementation phase of Corpora Space, slated for Spring 2012.\n",

    "description": "Documenting the Now (DocNow) responds to the public's use of social media for chronicling historically significant events as well as demand from scholars and archivists seeking a user-friendly means of collecting and preserving digital content. This two-year project was funded by a $517,000 grant from [The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation](https://mellon.org/), and MITH will work with Washington University in St. Louis and the University of California, Riverside, as collaborators on the project. The three institutions are developing DocNow, a cloud-ready, open-source application that will be used for collecting tweets and their associated metadata and Web content.\nThe dramatic rise in the public's use of social media services to document events of historical significance presents archivists and others who build primary source research collections with a unique opportunity to transform appraisal, collecting, preservation and discovery of this new type of research data. The personal nature of documenting participation in historical events also presents researchers with new opportunities to engage with the data generated by individual users of services such as Twitter, which has emerged as one of the most important tools used in social activism to build support, share information and remain engaged. Twitter users document activities or events through the text, images, videos and audio embedded in or linked from their tweets. This means vast amounts of digital content is being shared and re-shared using Twitter as a platform for other social media applications like YouTube, Instagram, Flickr and the Web at large. While such digital content adds a new layer of documentary evidence that is immensely valuable to those interested in researching and understanding contemporary events, it also presents significant data management, rights management, access and visualization challenges.\nDocNow will develop new tools, knowledge and user communities to enable and promote the collection, preservation, visualization and analysis of social media content generated through this new wave of social activism, storytelling and community documentation. The project will result in an open-source application for collecting tweets, their associated Web content (text, images, video and audio) and metadata, as well as creating data views and export mechanisms both for use with data visualization platforms and for preservation. It will utilize Ferguson-related tweets and Web content as the subject of application development, delivering a Ferguson social media data set for research and preservation, and build a community of users and advocates around the DocNow application.\n",

    "description": "MITH Associate Director [Matthew Kirschenbaum](https://archive.mith.umd.edu/mith-2020/index.html%3Fp=3845.html) completed a Fellowship project in 2004-05, which consisted of research toward the completion of his first book, _Mechanisms: New Media and the Forensic Imagination. Mechanisms _was published by the MIT Press in early 2008.\nTaking its cues from textual studies and recent critical interest in writing and inscription technologies, _Mechanisms_ addresses itself to the material and historical particulars of landmark works of new media and electronic literature, applying computer forensics to conduct new kinds of media-specific readings and drawing on significant new archival sources for works like Michael Joyce’s Afternoon and William Gibson’s electronic poem “Agrippa.” _Mechanisms_ has won the 2009 Richard J. Finneran Award from the Society for Textual Scholarship (STS), the 2009 George A. and Jean S. DeLong Prize from the Society for the History of Authorship, Reading, and Publishing (SHARP), and the 16th annual Prize for a First Book from the Modern Language Association (MLA).\n",

    "description": "With generous funding from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, OpenITI AOCP will create a new digital text production pipeline for Persian and Arabic texts. OpenITI AOCP will catalyze the digitization of the Persian and Arabic written traditions by addressing the central technical and organizational impediments stymying the development of improved OCR for Arabic-script languages. Through a unique interdisciplinary collaboration between humanities scholars, computer scientists, developers, library scientists, and digital humanists, OpenITI AOCP will forge CorpusBuilder 1.0 — an OCR pipeline and post-correction interface — into a user-friendly digital text production pipeline with a wide range of new OCR enhancements and expanded text export functionality. The project will also include a series of workshops, a full corpus development pilot, and a Persian and Arabic typeface inventory, all of which will inform the development of the technical components in important ways.\nAt MITH, Raffaele Viglianti will focus on modeling the textual data in TEI format and produce software to export the project data into a number of formats.\n",

    "description": "The goal of Soweto ’76 is to provide users with virtual access to the history of Soweto, a Black township outside Johannesburg, so that they may experience a significant period in South Africa’s history. Using existing oral histories, testimonies, photographs, video footage, material objects, and sound recordings in the collections of the Hector Pieterson Memorial & Museum, the work seeks to redress the existing portrayal of the lives of township residents in the mainstream or “official” historical record. Soweto ’76 seeks to first address the absence of accounts from those students involved in the Uprisings (1) by making these multimedia texts accessible online and (2) by providing digital tools to facilitate a comparative analysis of the competing interpretations of key events. The site undertakes the challenges of collating the experiences (or “collating the narratives”) and interpretations of the various historical and contemporary actors. The vantage point of the user changes as the various forms of multimedia data are accessed on the site. These “collated narratives” include both spatial and temporal representations of the events occurring on 16 June 1976.\nOn that fateful day in 1976, Soweto students gathered to protest the use of the Afrikaans language as a medium of teaching and learning in black schools. Shortly thereafter, police began shooting at the assembled marchers, violently disrupting what was to be a peaceful protest. Hector Pieterson’s death—and the subsequent murder of other protestors in the Uprisings that would help bring about the first democratic elections of 1994—are memorialized at this national heritage site.\n",

        "description": "### \"Soweto '76, A Living Digital Archive\" \nby Angel David Nieves\nThe aim of Soweto '76 is to develop an interactive immersive edutainment application and multimedia interface that allows users to experience a historically recreated urban environment with the support of primary and secondary archival materials. With the creation of a historically accurate environment as a platform, users will be able to assume the role of a character from the time period, and experience their reactions to actual events from their particular vantage point. It is hoped that users of Soweto '76 will act as virtual witnesses to the events of June 16, 1976–events that catalyzed the massive student uprisings against the apartheid regime. Using existing oral histories, testimonies, photographs, video footage, material objects, and sound recordings in the collections of the Hector Pieterson Museum, the work seeks to redress the uneven portrayal of the lives of Black township residents in the mainstream or \"official\" historical record. Soweto '76 seeks to first address the absence of accounts from those students involved in the Uprisings (1) by making these multimedia texts accessible online and (2) by providing digital tools to facilitate a comparative analysis of the competing interpretations of key events. The site undertakes the challenges of collating the experiences (or \"collating the narratives\") and interpretive vantage points of the various historical and contemporary actors. The vantage point of the user changes as the various forms of multimedia data are accessed on the site. These \"collated narratives\" will include both spatial and temporal representations of the events occurring on 16 June. \n### \"In the Footsteps of the Old Heads: Saraka and Nation in the Caribbean\" \nby Merle Collins\nThis project is an exploration of African survivals and re-creations in the Caribbean island of Grenada. Conceptualized as a multi-media project, the project aims to produce a video-recording of aspects of a harvest celebration known as the saraka, and, through research and interviews, to trace the origins of the saraka and its observation by those who feel a duty to continue it because they have inherited it from their ancestors, those whom they refer to as the \"old heads\". The project aims to use current cellphone technology to disseminate information regarding various elements of the saraka as one component of its interface.\n",

The four courses were also planned to be linked for some activities in a multiple-course environment. The site contained many pedagogical features including chat, threaded conferences, space for individual and collaborative projects, readings and other resources.\n",

    "description": "In 1985 Samuel Beckett directed “Waiting for Godot”, “Krapp’s Last Tape” and “Endgame” as stage pieces with the San Quentin Players. All three productions were grouped together under the overall title “Beckett Directs Beckett.” As such they toured throughout Europe and in some parts of Asia to wide acclaim. Furthermore, each time a new tour was organized for these productions, after sometimes lengthy lacunae, Beckett has, with the assistance of Walter Asmus, and/or Alan Mandell, brought them back to performance level.\nThough the initial productions as staged in 1985 already brought forth substantial changes in the published acting texts of the plays, each time a re-mounting of the productions occurred additional changes were made. The same was true during the production period for these television versions, with Beckett sometimes making textual changes on the telephone even as a given scene was being taped. For these productions, it was our intention and design to open them out beyond the confines of the stage in order to accommodate them to the television medium. Walter Asmus and Alan Mandell, both of whom enjoyed the author’s complete confidence, were responsible for this part of the endeavor.\n",

    "description": "Performance today holds the mirror up to a diverse and changing world. English speaking performers must have the skill and ability to acquire any accent or dialect (a regional variety of an accent) with the specific lilt, rhythms, intonations and sound changes intrinsic to each individual region a character represents. In order to do this, the performer must have access to authentic sources for hearing and seeing the gestural aspects of accent and dialect.\nThe Visual Accent & Dialect Archive (VADA) is an archive of video clips from around the world, providing both aural and visual information about a dialect or accent. Other academic speech/accent libraries and archives on the web offer only the aural aspect of learning an accent.\n",

        "description": "The [Visual Accent Dialect Archive (VADA)](http://visualaccentdialectarchive.com/) was created as a central resource for performers seeking authentic dialects and accents of the English language in which they could see the speakers as well as hear them. The gestural characteristics of the speakers from different regions, while unique to the speaker, are also unique to the culture of the region and help the researcher to acquire the sounds intrinsic to that dialect or accent by the formation of the lips and use of the vocal and articulatory musculature. As a crowd-sourced website, or \"wiki\", the Visual Accent Dialect Archive has the potential to attract dialect and accent donations from all over the world. Donors may speak a story, or a list of words, or a paragraph. Once the VADA website is populated, researchers can click on a specific region, country, or state and locate the specific dialect or accent. In addition to being a central resource for performers, the website provides excellent cultural information for anthropologists and linguists.\n",

        "description": "After twelve years in McKeldin Library, staff expansion and research growth called for a more robust space in 2012. We transformed a significantly larger, sunlit, open-floor space in Hornbake Library, neighboring Nonprint Media Services, and the iSchool, into the new digital humanities hub.\nOn September 5th, 2012 MITH invited friends and colleagues present and past to help us celebrate our move to a new space. Director of the [Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media](http://chnm.gmu.edu/) (CHNM) Dan Cohen gave the keynote, highlighting MITH's international work and membership in the \"DH culture of nice.\" University of Maryland Vice President for Research Pat O'Shea, College of Arts and Humanities Dean Bonnie Thornton Dill, and Dean of Libraries Pat Steele also spoke.\nThanks to everyone who joined us [in person](https://secure.flickr.com/photos/18303158@N00/7944898270/in/pool-mith) and [in spirit](https://twitter.com/fraistat/status/243401261209251841)!\n_[Watch Video on Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/48973729)_\n_[View Reception Invitation](https://airtable.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/UMD.MITH_.ReceptionInvite.pdf)_\n_[Photos by Travis Brown](http://www.flickr.com/photos/travisbrown/sets/72157631427840226/with/7939890054/)_\n_[Photos by Rachel Donahue](https://picasaweb.google.com/108869124694173459710/MITHOpeningReception#5785077934074886034)_\n",

    "description": "The Digital Humanities Data Curation Institutes project will facilitate a multi-institutional collaboration between MITH and the University Libraries at UMD, the [Women Writers Project ](http://www.wwp.brown.edu/)(WWP) at Brown University, and the [Center for Informatics Research in Science and Scholarship ](http://cirss.lis.illinois.edu/)(CIRSS) at the Graduate School of Library and Information Science (GSLIS), at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign to provide three workshops during 2013.\nThe practice of cutting-edge humanities research increasingly involves acquisition, synthesis, and management of data in digital form. The theoretical knowledge and practical skills of information science, librarianship, and archival science represent a vital component of the skill set that will be required to succeed in the rapidly transforming landscape of the academy and the wider society.\nDigital Humanities Data Curation institutes served as opportunities for participants with all levels of expertise—from beginners to the most advanced—to receive guidance in understanding the role of data curation in enriching humanities research projects. By the conclusion of each institute, participants will be adept at formulating solutions for existing challenges and will be able to document their data curation strategies in the form of data curation plans and strategic risk assessments, a key element of innovative digital scholarship.\nApplications to join this cohort of scholars focused on discipline-specific curation practices and skills were announced in late fall 2012, with the Institute beginning in Spring 2013. The Digital Humanities Data Curation Institutes project is supported by a National Endowment for the Humanities Institutes for Advanced Topics grant (2012).\nA generous grant from the [National Endowment for the Humanities](http://www.neh.gov/) will support a series of three-day workshops to introduce humanists, librarians, and advanced graduate students to the principles and practices of data curation.\n## About the Institute\nCarrying out computational research with digital materials requires that both scholars and information professionals understand how to manage and curate data over its entire lifetime of interest. At the least, individual scholars must be able to document their data curation strategies and evaluate those of collaborators and other purveyors of humanities data. The three-day workshops will provide a strong introductory grounding in data curation concepts and practices, focusing on the special issues and challenges of data curation in the digital humanities. Learning will be largely case-based, supplemented by short lectures, guest presentations, and practical exercises.\nAll participants will also have access to an online resource for sharing knowledge about data curation for the humanities. This resource will build on material from the existing [DH Curation Guide](http://guide.dhcuration.org/).\nParticipants will learn how to:\n- Model humanities data for sustainable computational research\n- Identify, assess, and mitigate risks to their data\n- Evaluate tools and systems for working with data from a curatorial perspective\n- Plan and implement data management during all phases of a project’s lifecycle\n- Leverage data curation skills to improve scholarly publications, grant applications, and promotion dossiers\n- Understand and stay current with the landscape of data curation research\n",

    "description": "_Digital Feminisms: Transnational Activism in German Protest Cultures_ was a fellowship project led by [Hester Baer](../../people/person/hester-baer/index.html), the 2014-15 [Vambery Distinguished Professor of Comparative Studies](http://mith.umd.edu/community/fellowships/clara-and-robert-vambery-distinguished-professor-of-comparative-studies/). _Digital Feminisms_ examined the reconfigurations of feminist activism in the context of rapid technological change, analyzing how the increased use of digital media has altered, influenced, and shaped feminist politics in the twenty-first century. Addressing the role of digital media in the transnational flow of feminist ideas, politics, and protesters, the project focused on Germany in order to examine the way transnational feminist activism intersects with the national configuration of feminist political work, and how feminist activism may in turn transform emergent digital cultures. Bringing together scholars from the US, Canada, Germany, and the UK, this transdisciplinary, collaborative project engaged digital media not only as its scholarly focus but also as a key component of the project's methodology. Combining digital humanities paradigms with a conventional academic publishing project, _Digital Feminisms_ sought to develop a new research model that reaches multiple constituencies, while also reflecting critically on the subject of transnational feminist activism and digital culture through its presentation formats.\n",

They used a book containing at least seven treatises by Archimedes, a book with two speeches by Hyperides, fragments of a philosophical text most likely written by Alexander of Aphrodisias, fragments from a Life of St. Pantoleon, fragments from a Menaion, and two unidentified texts.\n",

        "description": "The Archimedes Palimpsest is a manuscript of extraordinary importance to the history of science. This thirteenth century prayer book contains erased texts that were written several centuries earlier still. These erased texts include two treatises by Archimedes that can be found nowhere else, The Method and Stomachion. The manuscript sold at auction to a private collector on the 29th October 1998. The owner deposited the manuscript at The Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland, a few months later. Since that date the manuscript has been the subject of conservation, imaging and scholarship, in order to better read the texts. The Archimedes Palimpsest project, as it is called, has shed new light on Archimedes and revealed new texts from the ancient world. It has also generated a great deal of public curiosity, as well as the interest of scholars throughout the world. On 29th October 2008, we celebrated the ten year anniversary of the project. What was erased text, in terrible condition, impossible to access, and yet foundational to the history and science of the West, is now legible, and instantly available for free on the Web. This talk will cover the evolution of the project as well as its future directions.\n",

In this talk, I will engage in some general musings about the nature of that amorphous mass we call a “project,” but I will also relate the particular history of and deliver some specific data concerning the THATCamp project. A sneak preview: since its start in 2008, THATCamp, The Humanities and Technology Camp, has seen more than 170 events held or planned worldwide and has provided digital training and professional development to more than 6000 people, most of them humanities scholars, students, or professionals. Whether we consider it one project or many, THATCamp has become an essential feature of the digital humanities landscape, and it is time for some perspective on it.\n**10:45 – 11:00 am**\nBreak\n**11:00 am**\nProject Discussions begin\n<small>This event is not sponsored by, or offered on behalf of, the U.S. Government, the National Endowment for the Humanities, or its Office of Digital Humanities. This is entirely optional.</small>\n## Logistical Information\nThe University of Maryland serves as the flagship educational institution for the State of Maryland and attracts talented faculty, students, and staff from throughout the DC Metro region.

        "talk title": "Performance in Digital Poetry",
        "description": "With origins in the avant-garde movement of the first half of twentieth century, digital poetry extends the creative repertoire of this experimental poetry tradition using computers in the composition, generation, or presentation of texts. If in Italian Futurist poetry performance engages with the traditional conventions such as spatial distribution of elements on page that make the work a poem, in digital poetry performance becomes part of poetry making. Computer programming turns such poetry into interactive sites of encounter between authors, texts, and readers. In so doing, it invites speculation about the nature of poetry and generates debates on how digital spaces represent places where these identities meet, interact, and overlap. Moreover, the aspect of performance as spectacle and of digital poetry as scripted performance in particular, emphasizes a symbiotic relationship between digital poetry and its readers. This talk will approach performance through the lens of three interrelated aspects: as a technique of digital poetry creation; as spectacle; and as representation of cultural intersections. Theoretical considerations drawn from the work of Gianni Toti, Caterina Davinio, and Loss Pequeno Glazier will frame more general discussion of the poetry.\n",

    "description": "The Text-Image Linking Environment (TILE) is a web-based tool for creating and editing image-based electronic editions and digital archives of humanities texts.\nTILE was awarded an NEH Preservation and Access grant in 2009 to create the next generation of technical infrastructure supporting image-based editions and electronic archives of humanities content. With diverse partners including Indiana University Bloomington, the Royal Irish Academy, the University of Oregon, and Harvard's Center for Hellenic Studies. TILE was proposed as an extension of the NEH-funded [AXE](https://archive.mith.umd.edu/mith-2020/index.html%3Fp=5269.html) to increase the ease and efficiency of linking images and text within a web interface.\n",

    "description": "Choreographer Merce Cunningham’s death in the summer of 2009 was a stark reminder of the ephemerality of dance and of the rapidly vanishing human record of the art in the 20th century. Although a good deal of work has been done using notation systems, video, motion capture technologies, and oral history, there is still a strong feeling among dancers, software developers, and scholars that current methods do not sufficiently document the art and allow it to be preserved over time. Dance scholars, artists, and motion capture specialists have long understood that dance consists of much more than the motion of the body through space, though what else and to what degree other elements are important is a matter of much debate.\nThe Documentation and Preservation of Dance project brings together an interdisciplinary team from MITH, the Advanced Computing Center for the Arts and Design (ACCAD) at Ohio State University, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts to host a series of workshops that will establish and document the current state of the art and push forward action on this pressing problem of dance preservation.\n",

    "description": "Silvia Mejia was a Clara and Robert Vambery Distinguished Graduate Fellow and MITH Graduate Fellow during academic years 2004-05 and 2005-06. Working from within the Comparative Literature program with John Fuegi, and with MITH Director Martha Nell Smith, Mejia focused on three different narrations of migration from Ecuador to the United States, Spain and Italy. The resulting documentary video and its study guide explored how new technologies such as the Internet, satellite communications, email, videoconferences, and cell phones have changed the experience of displacement.\nWith a comparative and translocal approach, this project explores multiple relationships with new technologies determined by gender, age, race, ethnicity, education, computer literacy, geographical situation, and socio-economic background. Through their differing and even contradictory discourses and practices, expressed and lived in geographical locations that coexist and overlap on the screen, the protagonists of this dissertation-documentary video show us to what extent they are inscribed in different places of enunciation that shape their experience of displacement and nostalgia in contrasting ways.\n_Text extracted from [dissertation abstract](http://drum.lib.umd.edu/handle/1903/6891), located in the Digital Repository at the University of Maryland (DRUM)._\n",

    "description": "Books.Files: Assessing Digital Assets in the Book Industry for Scholarly Use is a project to assess the potential for the archival collection and scholarly study of digital assets associated with today's trade publishing and bookmaking. Books.Files was generously funded by The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, as a collaboration between MITH and the [Book Industry Study Group.](http://bisg.org/)\nThe fact is that nearly all printed books now begin---and for many practical purposes end---their lifecycles as digital files that are produced and managed by designers, editors, publishers, packagers, and printers. The printed book that we hold in our hands is just one of the outputs that can be derived from these digital assets, which are also used to produce ebooks and Web-ready texts. In particular, the role of Adobe InDesign and other software tools is not well understood outside of the industry. And yet, this is where the book stops being a manuscript and starts _becoming_ a book, by way of its transformation into a prescribed set of digital assets which in addition to the text may include stylesheets, fonts, metadata, images, and other design elements.\nLed by principal investigator Matthew Kirschenbaum, this project represents the first organized attempt to put ambassadors from the scholarly communities traditionally invested in safeguarding and studying the material history of bookmaking into contact and conversation with thought leaders and influencers from the contemporary publishing world. The centerpiece of the project will be a convening to bring those figures together in New York City in early 2018; Kirschenbaum's efforts will also be supported by site visits to observe the bookmaking process as it unfolds across different settings, and interviews with industry experts. Findings for scholars, archivists, and publishers will be presented in a white paper made publicly available in late 2018.\nInquiries about Books.Files may be sent to [Matthew Kirschenbaum](mailto:mgk@umd.edu).\n",

    "description": "In Fall 2000, the University of Maryland School of Music voted unanimously to begin offering its Masters of Ethnomusicology program in a combined residential/online program with the goal of targeting students in Latin America and Spain through courses taught primarily in Spanish. In addition to the fact that online courses were gaining significant traction at universities during this time, an additional rationale was that, (from the project proposal), \"Issues of cultural pluralism, accelerated immigration patterns, and the globalization of knowledge have created a climate wherein scholars and performers with training in ethnomusicology are beginning to play a critical role. The demographic changes affecting the US are also being felt in Spain and Latin America, where there are virtually no universities offering degrees or even basic training in ethnomusicology. Meanwhile, Spanish schools and music institutes are clamoring for help in integrating a growing gypsy and North African population, and Latin American educators are struggling with ways in which the voices of indigenous peoples can be made audible. The interdisciplinary, cross-cultural training of ethnomusicologists prepares them to build bridges and create dialogue between human populations through performance.\"\nFormer MITH Faculty Fellow Carolina Robertson, who eventually worked on the [Narratives That Heal](../../index.html%3Fp=6417.html) project, collaborated with MITH on the development of the online learning environment for this Distributed Learning Masters, making Spain/Online an early \"MITH Affiliate.\" \nYou can view an [archived version of the website](https://web.archive.org/web/20030624011209/http://www.e-learning.umd.edu/ethno/programdescription.html) on the Wayback Machine.\n",

    "description": "In a “culture of images” where access to and transmission of integrated text, video, photographs, and sound happens almost seamlessly, the poetic tradition of looking at, describing, and narrating the visual arts—ekphrasis—might appear quaint. Why would poets spend so much time writing about these subjects when cameras, computers, copiers, screens, and printers have made reproduction almost effortless? And yet, in the face of these emerging technologies and the rapid reproduction of art by an increasingly technologically savvy public, some of the most celebrated poems of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries are ekphrastic.\nThis study considers the unlikely popularity of contemporary ekphrastic poems, particularly those by female poets in the U.S., and theorizes a broader, more complex model to explain how the genre operates, one which accounts for inter-aesthetic relationships historically labeled as outliers. Using advanced computational methods, this project challenges longstanding critical assumptions about ekphrasis: that poets will ultimately comment on the stillness and muteness of the visual work of art; that ekphrastic speech turns upon the typically gendered axis of inter-arts rivalry; that descriptions of art and descriptions of nature in verse are indistinguishable in style and form. By supporting the use of computational tools to read patterns of subjects and word choice across hundreds of modern poems, the MITH Winnemore Dissertation Fellowship enables this project to uncover new methodologies for asking traditional humanities questions—ones stretching back as far as Homer’s description of Achilles’ shield in _The Illiad_—from new perspectives and with fresh insight.\nThe Winnemore phase of Review, Revise, Requery was completed August 2012.\n_The technological infrastructure for this project has been supported in part by a generous grant from [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/)._\n",

        "description": "Ekphrasis—poetry to, for, and about the visual arts—provides rich territory for the exploration of literary tradition and genre definition. This talk will consider the challenges and opportunities presented when using topic modeling to consider issues of genre and discourse in ekphrastic poetry. Oriented toward the non-expert, conversation will assume no prior knowledge of topic modeling or social network analysis, but instead will provide a gentle introduction that builds toward an understanding of the potential uses for topic modeling and network analysis to explore large collections of poetic texts. Poetic collections, dense and rich with figurative language, require revising how we interpret topic modeling results, and this presentation will address how changes in interpretation affect the questions we might ask and the assumptions we can make about “topics” generated by latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)—one type of topic modeling algorithm.\nFurthermore, this talk will demonstrate how the story of ekphrasis, a genre of poetry in which contributions by women are often seen as “in addition to” or “outside” of it, changes when we break open the binding of the canon and include poems by women as central to its tradition. The computational strengths afforded by LDA help reorganize critical thinking about ekphrasis as a complex distribution of discourses, and this talk will demonstrate a few possible ways to refocus the aperture of the critical lens to ask enduring humanities questions about visual-verbal relationships from new perspectives.\n",

    "description": "centerNet is an international network of digital humanities centers formed for cooperative and collaborative action to benefit digital humanities and allied fields in general, and centers as humanities cyberinfrastructure in particular. It developed from a meeting hosted by the U.S. National Endowment for the Humanities and the University of Maryland, College Park, April 12-13, 2007 in Washington, D.C., and is a response to the American Council of Learned Societies report on Cyberinfrastructure for the Humanities and Social Sciences, published in 2006. Since its inception in April 2007, centerNet has added over 200 members from about 100 centers in 19 countries. Regional centerNet affiliates have been established in Asia Pacific, Europe, North America, and the U.K. and Ireland, each with a steering committee. In  2009, centerNet became a founding member with DARIAH, CLARIN, PROJECT BAMBOO, and ADHO of CHAIN: the Coalition of Humanities and Arts Infrastructures and Networks. In June 2010, centerNet formally affiliated with the Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes (CHCI) in order to pursue an ambitious agenda of initiatives on matters of mutual interest. Together, the two organizations hope to foster disciplinary innovation and transformation in the humanities.\n",

    "description": "The Digital Humanities Incubator is intended to help introduce University of Maryland faculty, staff, and graduate assistants to digital humanities methods and tools through a series of workshops, tutorials, and project consultations. The [first phase of the Incubator](../digital-humanities-incubator-2012-13/index.html) concentrated on working with UMD Libraries faculty and staff exclusively. This second phase, entitled \"Researching Ferguson,\" is a broader campus-wide initiative which aims to provide leadership and training on event-based social media data and network analysis.\nIn October 2014, MITH began spearheading a series of meetings to develop research and teaching opportunities for the use of the [Ferguson Twitter archive](../../miths-ed-summers-discusses-ferguson-twitter-archive/index.html), which is a collection of tweets harvested by MITH's Ed Summers using a command line program named [twarc](http://github.com/edsu/twarc) in August 2014 in the wake of the events in Ferguson, MO. MITH's early work with this collection was conducted in collaboration with the ARHU Center for Synergy, and in October and December 2014 MITH hosted two brainstorming sessions with various UMD faculty and students. MITH introduced the collection and solicited feedback regarding its possible value and use to the scholarly community.\nThe discussions that took place at both prior events allowed MITH to synthesize the input that was received, which was used to begin planning for several ongoing MITH [Digital Humanities Incubator](../digital-humanities-incubator/index.html) sessions ran throughout February 2015 as part of Black History Month, and continued throughout Spring 2015. These workshops were part of the broader, university-wide effort to engage the [#BlackLivesMatter](http://blacklivesmatterumd.tumblr.com/) movement at the University of Maryland.\n",

These questions are especially vital when social media data is being used to study social justice issues.\nIn this workshop we’ll review basic research ethics for public datasets, and then discuss unsolved ethical challenges for the use of Twitter data. We will also discuss strategies for ensuring best-effort ethical approaches in this emerging research space. We’ll also consider Twitter datasets as materials for current and future archives—how is this medium redefining archival sources and notions of historical evidence? If we think of this data as part of a historical record does that change our evaluation of how the collection of data we have reflects actual public sentiments (its representativeness), and what biases might it reflect or contain in its construction. Who/what is being remembered, and who/what is being forgotten, when we study and preserve such data? And, finally, in order to facilitate active research now and maintain this data into the future we’ll cover basic strategies for managing and maintaining social media data collected as part of research.\n",

This workshop will help you do that by describing the anatomy of a Tweet, the mechanics of JSON data, and how to write a simple program to process the data. Learning how to dig into your Twitter dataset is an important step as you plan for some of the more advanced tools we will learn about in Session V. Participants in this workshop will come away with a better understanding of processing Twitter JSON data, and be able to programmatically explore the data with simple open source tools. This is a hands-on workshop, so in order to participate fully, please bring a personal laptop with you. You should also try to download and install Python and JQ (both are available free, see links below).

The two-year $590,000 award under NDIIPP’s Preserving Creative America program was shared among the project participants.\nThe Preserving Virtual Worlds project explored methods for preserving digital games, interactive fiction, and shared real time virtual spaces. Major activities include developing basic standards for metadata and content representation and conducting a series of archiving case studies for early video games and electronic literature, as well as Second Life, the popular and influential multi-user online world.\nAccording to Fraistat, “This award from the Library of Congress places MITH and its partners at the forefront of those addressing a range of increasingly urgent questions involving the preservation of creative works that are “born digital”—from interactive electronic literature, to digital games, to virtual worlds such as Second Life. We are especially pleased to have as an industry partner, Linden Lab, the creator of Second Life itself.”\nIn addition to contributing to the work on Second Life, MITH took the lead on interactive fiction/electronic literature as a sub-domain of the project, and is occupied with all aspects of scoping, metadata, intellectual property, evaluation, and archiving of these materials. MITH initially focused on a small number of targeted works of recognized cultural and literary significance, including former Poet Laureate Robert Pinsky’s 1984 interactive novel _Mindwheel_, Will Crowther’s ADVENTURE (written in 1975 and widely considered the earliest interactive text of its kind), and selected items from a large private collection of 1980s-era hardware and software recently gifted to MITH.\n",

        "description": "Videogame preservation has made great strides in the last four years, from having the Art of Video Games on display at the Smithsonian Museum of American Art to making the program of the annual Game Developers conference. As with any other type of preservation or conservation, preserving videogames requires some fairly esoteric knowledge and specialized implements to do well. In this talk, Donahue will present some of the tools (hardware, software, and other) she used and helped create to benefit videogame preservation during her work with the [Preserving Virtual Worlds](https://archive.mith.umd.edu/mith-2020/research/pvwi/index.html) project.\n",

The conference supports a broad community of practitioners working to ensure long term access for various personal collections and archives. The Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) at the University of Maryland and the National Digital Information Infrastructure Program at the Library of Congress will co-host the conference in conjunction with the University of Maryland Libraries.\nBringing Personal Digital Archiving 2013 to the Washington, D.C. region has great potential to expand and enrich the interactions of conference participants by drawing individual attendees not just from the strong community that has developed over the past three years but also from the academic community and cultural heritage institutions located in the national capitol region.\nPresentations, photos, and other materials from previous Personal Digital Archiving conferences can be found at [The Internet Archive](http://archive.org/).\n",

    "description": "Social media platforms enable connection and sharing among friends, family and colleagues, while offering unprecedented opportunities for getting ideas out to much larger audiences. Political events such as the [Arab Spring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring) and social movements like [Black Lives Matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter) show what important work is possible with social media at scale.\nAt the same time social media can be used to spread messages of intolerance, harassment and hate, as we've seen in the rhetoric surrounding [Gamergate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamergate_controversy) and the [2016 presidential race](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2016/hate-race). Women, members of ethnic minorities, and activists often find themselves the target of trolls and organized groups that attempt to shut down and silence their work.\nPlease join us at MITH (and remotely) to gather with others looking to learn from each other about how to investigate and thwart hate speech in social media. The Southern Poverty Law Center's [Extremist Files](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files) provides a list of known hate groups. At our Night Against Hate event we will collaboratively try to link the SPLC list to social media accounts. This list can then be used by researchers here at UMD and elsewhere to examine the effect that these groups are having online. In addition, we hope to use this event to learn from each other about emerging tools and techniques of self care while working online.\nIf you're planning to attend in person or remotely, [please click here to sign up.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf_eIHiYZiDqwmxLebU1VDwh5U381cTLFP0jOJd7ijJ0ufLrw/viewform) Pizza will be provided for those that can make it to MITH.\n",

        "description": "Social media platforms enable connection and sharing among friends, family and colleagues, while offering unprecedented opportunities for getting ideas out to much larger audiences. Political events such as the [Arab Spring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring) and social movements like [Black Lives Matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter) show what important work is possible with social media at scale. \nAt the same time social media can be used to spread messages of intolerance, harassment and hate, as we've seen in the rhetoric surrounding [Gamergate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamergate_controversy) and the [2016 presidential race](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2016/hate-race). Women, members of ethnic minorities, and activists often find themselves the target of trolls and organized groups that attempt to shut down and silence their work. \nPlease join us at MITH (and remotely) to gather with others looking to learn from each other about how to investigate and thwart hate speech in social media. The Southern Poverty Law Center's [Extremist Files](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files) provides a list of known hate groups. At our Night Against Hate event we will collaboratively try to link the SPLC list to social media accounts. This list can then be used by researchers here at UMD and elsewhere to examine the effect that these groups are having online. In addition, we hope to use this event to learn from each other about emerging tools and techniques of self care while working online. \nIf you're planning to attend in person or remotely, [please click here to sign up.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf_eIHiYZiDqwmxLebU1VDwh5U381cTLFP0jOJd7ijJ0ufLrw/viewform) Pizza will be provided for those that can make it to MITH.\n",

    "description": "The Ajax XML Encoder (AXE), developed at the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH), revolutionizes the production of electronic editions and digital archives. AXE, the first item in MITH’s proposed toolkit for the digital humanities, is a web-based tool for “tagging” text, video, audio, and image files with XML metadata, a process that is now a necessary but onerous first step in the production of digital material. With an intuitive, web-based interface, AXE makes this process more efficient and accurate. It also facilitates collaboration in the digital humanities by permitting multiple scholars to work on the same document or archive at the same time from various locations, and tracks all work so that variant versions can be collated and all versions can be archived. The open source AXE provides a free and improved alternative to existing software for tagging all kinds of digital content in an increasingly web-based and multi-medial digital environment.\n",

However, in the early 00s, the resource was unique in the specificity of its objective to support further growth and institutionalization of women’s studies programs.\n",

    "description": "Digital music scores have the potential of being flexible, interactive, and dynamic. Raff Viglianti has created two dynamic scores influenced by the weather as a proof-of-concept.\n_[Meteomozart](https://raffazizzi.github.io/meteomozart/)_ is a dynamic score of Mozart's Piano Sonata No.13 in B♭ major, K.333/315c. The score is dynamically adjusted based on the weather at your location (or at a location you set). Different slurs and dynamics are shown, taken from four sources: Mozart's 1783 manuscript, the first printed edition (1784) and two performing editions by Bartók (1911) and Saint-Saëns (1915). Meteomozart presents a slightly unpredictable text instead of a clear one. It is obvious from audio recordings that the same work of music can be performed in more than one way; likewise, this experiment tries to make it obvious that the score may have more than just one \"text\" and possibly pique the interest of performers to take control of the variants as opposed to having the weather determining them.\n_[Chance of Weather](https://raffazizzi.github.io/chanceOfWeather/)_ is a dynamic piano piece by composer Joseph L. Arkfeld (UMD). _Chance of Weather_ is a modern take on a piano program piece that takes inspiration from weather conditions. Rather than focusing on a specific condition or setting, such as Debussy's _Jardins sous la pluie_, _Chance of Weather_ engages with the weather that is currently affecting the performance environment. The piece is based on a dynamic digital score that follows pre-composed patterns depending on the weather at the location where it is being performed. The piece invites the outside world into the performance space, which is usually sterile to the elements. If the audience had to walk through a windy and rainy evening to get to a windowless, temperature controlled performance space, they will find that _Chance of Weather_ evokes the gusts and the dampness of their day. Likewise, if they came on a pleasant warm afternoon, the piece will reflect their recent experience.\n",

    "description": "The Shelley-Godwin Archive provides the digitized manuscripts of Percy Bysshe Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, William Godwin, and Mary Wollstonecraft, aiming to unite online for the first time the widely dispersed handwritten legacy of this uniquely gifted family of writers, and thereby document their works, life, and thought, including the development of many outstanding pieces of English literature and political philosophy.\nThe result of a partnership between the [New York Public Library](http://www.nypl.org/) and the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities, in cooperation with Oxford’s [Bodleian Library](http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/), the S-GA also includes key contributions from the Huntington Library, the British Library, and the Houghton Library. In total, these partner libraries contain over 90% of all known relevant manuscripts.\nAs we expand the holdings of the S-GA, we are providing open and centralized access for the widely distributed manuscripts, making them viewable as pages both in the order in which they appear in the manuscript and in the linear sequence in which they appear in the work. Over time, we hope to present all known manuscripts for any given work of our four authors.\nThe innovative technical architecture of the S-GA builds on open standards and the principles of the linked data movement, and has been designed to support user curation in subsequent phases of the project. Rather than serving only as a point of access, the S-GA will thus function ultimately as a work-site for scholars, students, and the general public, whose contributions in the form of transcriptions, corrections, annotations, and TEI encoding will create a commons through which various discourse networks related to its texts intersect and interact. The more immediate goal for the S-GA’s current phase, however, is to provide access to page images under open licenses with fully encoded transcriptions for as many of these manuscripts as possible.\n For more information on the project and for a full list of participants and sponsors [visit the project website](http://www.shelleygodwinarchive.org).\n",

    "description": "Concerned, thematically, with postcolonial cultural formations, and in particular the experience of the African Diaspora, the Saraka and Nation project traces connections between cultures of Africans in the Americas and sites of memory in Africa.\nThrough investigation of aspects of contemporary hemispheric American culture—narrative traditions such as Ananse/folk stories of the southern United States and the Caribbean, capoeira dances of Brazil, Big Drum Nation Dance of Carriacou, Voudoun traditions of Haiti, Saraka and Shango/Orisha in Trinidad & Tobago and Grenada—the project identifies and establishes contact with specific sites in Africa. The Ananse stories of the U.S. South and the Caribbean suggest connections with Ghana, Brazil’s capoeira references Angola, saraka and Shango/Orisha have cultural references suggesting links with Yoruba traditions existing largely in what is contemporary Nigeria, songs and dances of the Carriacou Big Drum invoke “nations” such as Temne, Ibo, Arada, Asante and Gaa (Kromantyn)—precolonial nations existing today in postcolonial nation states like Ghana, Sierra Leone, Senegal, Nigeria and Burkina Faso.\nCompleted in collaboration with researchers in the Americas, Africa and Europe, the project’s first phase is already being used (spring 2008) for teaching in the humanities.\n",

        "description": "### \"Soweto '76, A Living Digital Archive\" \nby Angel David Nieves\nThe aim of Soweto '76 is to develop an interactive immersive edutainment application and multimedia interface that allows users to experience a historically recreated urban environment with the support of primary and secondary archival materials. With the creation of a historically accurate environment as a platform, users will be able to assume the role of a character from the time period, and experience their reactions to actual events from their particular vantage point. It is hoped that users of Soweto '76 will act as virtual witnesses to the events of June 16, 1976–events that catalyzed the massive student uprisings against the apartheid regime. Using existing oral histories, testimonies, photographs, video footage, material objects, and sound recordings in the collections of the Hector Pieterson Museum, the work seeks to redress the uneven portrayal of the lives of Black township residents in the mainstream or \"official\" historical record. Soweto '76 seeks to first address the absence of accounts from those students involved in the Uprisings (1) by making these multimedia texts accessible online and (2) by providing digital tools to facilitate a comparative analysis of the competing interpretations of key events. The site undertakes the challenges of collating the experiences (or \"collating the narratives\") and interpretive vantage points of the various historical and contemporary actors. The vantage point of the user changes as the various forms of multimedia data are accessed on the site. These \"collated narratives\" will include both spatial and temporal representations of the events occurring on 16 June. \n### \"In the Footsteps of the Old Heads: Saraka and Nation in the Caribbean\" \nby Merle Collins\nThis project is an exploration of African survivals and re-creations in the Caribbean island of Grenada. Conceptualized as a multi-media project, the project aims to produce a video-recording of aspects of a harvest celebration known as the saraka, and, through research and interviews, to trace the origins of the saraka and its observation by those who feel a duty to continue it because they have inherited it from their ancestors, those whom they refer to as the \"old heads\". The project aims to use current cellphone technology to disseminate information regarding various elements of the saraka as one component of its interface.\n",

    "description": "The Portinari Project was one of the initial MITH Networked Associate Fellowship projects. MITH worked with João Candido Portinari, son of the late painter Candido Portinari, on a digital resource to make his work and legacy available broadly on the web.\nThe late Candido Portinari is considered to be the greatest artist Brazil has ever produced, yet by the year 2000, all but a few of his 4,000 paintings were out of public view. They had become dispersed in private collections in so many places that his biographer compared their fate to that of Brazil’s 18th-century revolutionary hero Tiradentes, whose body was dismembered and strewn along a 300-mile turnpike. The inaccessibility of Portinari’s work was particularly vexing to his enthusiasts because his own dedication to producing an epic view of Brazil for his countrymen was such that he continued painting even after doctors warned him that exposure to paint was killing him. He died of lead poisoning in 1962 at the age of 59. In a pioneering effort for Latin America in 2000, a team of experts in Rio began assembling the far-flung pieces of Portinari’s oeuvre into an exhaustive digital archive, where images as well as descriptive texts would eventually be fully searchable.\nJoão Candido Portinari, the painter’s son, coordinated the group of researchers who made their headquarters on the leafy campus of Rio’s Pontifical Catholic University. A telecommunications engineer with a Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a former chairman of the university’s mathematics department, Mr. Portinari brought exacting technical standards to the task. The 14-member team compiled photographic, technical, historical and bibliographical records on 3,800 of the paintings.\nPortinari’s personal habits and the scant attention that Brazilian society has traditionally paid to preserving its heritage have added a dash of challenge to the team’s work. Portinari himself often didn’t sign of date his paintings, he gave many of them away, and he failed to keep records on some of those that he sold. Art dealing was long a haphazard affair in Brazil; the first commercial gallery in Rio de Janeiro opened only in 1960. Researchers have worked from some of the 8,000 pieces of correspondence and scores of photographs they have gathered to ferret out dates, titles, and sometimes the existence of previously unknown Portinari paintings.\nDuring its development, the project benefited from Brazilian Government grants, appeals abroad by Brazilian diplomatic missions, a contribution of free film and photographic equipment from Eastman Kodak, donations and the use of a computer from the International Business Machines Corporation, free tickets on the Brazilian international airline Varig and 30-second calls over the country’s major television network, TV Globo, that João Candido estimated had reached 30-million Brazilians. The search for Portinari’s paintings took the research team to 13 Brazilian states and to countries as wide ranging as Argentina, Finland, Haiti, and Bulgaria. The Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) was proud to host and help develop the early version of an online catalog and image display of Portinari’s work.\n",

    "description": "In 2007, MITH worked with former Associate Director Doug Reside to develop and host an online blog called _Musical Theatre Studies_. The blog was described as “the online hub for news and discussion relating to the academic study of musical theatre. Although the serious study of musical theatre is rapidly gaining interest in both the United States and the United Kingdom, the scholarly community, as yet, lacks an efficient online means of communication. It is the aim of this blog to meet this need. We will soon be posting calls for papers, academic job opportunities, book reviews, and other news items of interest to the musical theatre scholarly community.”\nThe blog was maintained sporadically until 2009, and MITH now maintains it as a legacy website.\n",

    "description": "MITH’s Vintage Computers is a website devoted to MITH’s sizable (and growing) collection of vintage computers, retro software, and other artifacts from the early era of personal computing. The centerpiece of the site is a considered metadata and modeling approach to computing hardware, whereby individual components of the vintage machines are documented, contextualized within their relation to the system as a whole, and expressed using Dublin Core. The site gathers links to other recent MITH projects in born-digital cultural heritage, and serves as a clearing house for our expanding portfolio in this area. It also includes newly written non-specialist’s documentation for the FC5025 Floppy Disk Controller, a device used to retrieve data off of obsolescent media formats.\nThe site is presented using the content management tool [Omeka](http://omeka.org/). It was researched and designed by Walker Sampson, who recently completed an MLS from the School of Information at the University of Texas. Sampson was in residence at MITH during the summer of 2010 under the auspices of the IMLS-sponsored Digital Humanities Model Internship Program. MITH’s Associate Director Matthew Kirschenbaum comments, “This site demonstrates the role that vintage computing can have in the environment of an active digital humanities center; as born-digital cultural heritage becomes ever more important, centers such as MITH will play a part alongside of libraries and archives in addressing its long-term presentation and curation.”\n",

    "description": "The Lakeland Community Heritage Project Digital Archive is a collaboration between the Lakeland Community Heritage Project (LCHP), and partners at the University of Maryland including [Dr. Mary Corbin Sies](http://amst.umd.edu/faculty/mary-corbin-sies/) of the Department of American Studies, MITH, and [Dr. Katrina Fenlon](https://ischool.umd.edu/faculty-staff/katrina-fenlon) of the College of Information Studies. The digital archive project builds upon LCHP's many years of work to document an historic African American community before and after segregation and contribute to an understanding of urban renewal's impact on communities of color.\nLakeland is an historic African American community established in 1890 and located in College Park, MD, adjacent to the University of Maryland campus. Lakeland thrived until its self-contained uniqueness was undermined by social change and a devastating urban renewal program which used eminent domain to \"take\" two thirds of Lakeland's territory and relocate roughly sixty-five households elsewhere in Prince George's County. Promised improved housing for Lakelanders never materialized, and the housing eventually built was not made available to displaced residents.\nIn 2009 the Department of American Studies began a collaboration with the Lakeland Community Heritage Project, establishing an ongoing community-engaged project whose primary achievement is creation of The Lakeland Digital Archive. The partnership provides LCHP — an all-volunteer historical society — with student and faculty labor to help document and archive Lakeland's history, while training students in an ethical and equitable practice of collaborative heritage research wherein Lakelanders produce historical knowledge using their own voices. The Archive contains photographs, land records, census data, newspaper clippings, maps, dozens of oral history sound files, archival records, and video recordings.\nA working group of this community-university partnership is directing a multiple-year effort to redesign the archive website in collaboration with members of the Lakeland community, and to explore other platforms for making Lakeland's heritage accessible to different populations: current and former Lakelanders, community elders, community young people, residents of Prince George's County, MD, and scholars interested in the history of African American communities and urban renewal and its ongoing consequences.\n",

    "description": "The Our Americas Archive Partnership is a collaboration between MITH’s [Early Americas Digital Archive](https://archive.mith.umd.edu/mith-2020/index.html%3Fp=5109.html) and Rice University’s [Americas Archive](http://scholarship.rice.edu/handle/1911/9219), Rice’s [Humanities Research Center](http://hrc.rice.edu/), Rice’s [Fondren Library](http://library.rice.edu/) and the library at [Instituto Mora](http://www.institutomora.edu.mx/) in Mexico. Its goal is to make digitally available texts written in or about the Americas that represent the full range and complexity of a multilingual “Americas” including Canada, the Caribbean, and Latin America.\nThe partnership between Maryland’s Early Americas Digital Archive (1492-1820) and Rice’s Americas collection (1811-1920) creates unique new research and teaching opportunities. The point of convergence between the Maryland and Rice archives is the cultural transformation created by the revolutions for independence that took place over a span of fewer than sixty years. The archive, however, spans the five hundred year period that saw the making of modern and colonial cultures in the Americas. Because of its range, the archive promises to reinvigorate the study of American literary and cultural history by creating surprising juxtapositions, emphasizing different models of periodization, and suggesting new avenues of cross-cultural influence.\nThe archive fosters new research that examines American literatures from a hemispheric perspective, develops a collection of texts, curricular models and teaching materials that embody a hemispheric approach to the study of the early Americas, and generates professional and intellectual exchanges among scholars from various fields.\n_The list of participating people on this page is only a partial list—the full set of acknowledgements for the project can be found [on the project website](http://oaap.rice.edu/about.php?page=project)._\n",

        "description": "The Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities hosted a two-day workshop on developing APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for the digital humanities. The workshop gathered 50 digital humanities scholars and developers, who along with industry leaders demonstrated their APIs during this “working weekend.” We discussed ways that existing and future APIs could be leveraged for digital humanities projects.\nThe workshop format consisted of morning presentations and afternoon unconferencing. We also scheduled time for lightning talks. Some participants sought to explore hands-on hacking of APIs following presentations; others discussed ways that they could use an existing API. The workshop included participants of varying skill levels and technical knowledge, and engaged both developers and project managers.\nQuestions can be directed to Dave Lester: [dlester@umd.edu](mailto:dlester@umd.edu).\n",

    "description": "Theatre Finder is a collaboratively edited, peer reviewed, online database of historic theatre architecture from the Minoan \"theatrical areas\" on the island of Crete, to the last theatre built before 1815.\nRecent scholarship has put increasing emphasis on the places of performance, examining the ways in which space can be manipulated to bring performers and their audiences together. A significant component of such work has been the study of theatre architecture. The Theatre Architecture working group of the International Federation for Theatre Research has begun to examine the ways in which architecture can establish audience expectations, and enhance or limit an audience's experience of a performance.\nLittle attempt has been made, however, to apply these approaches to historic theatre buildings, in large part because of the prohibitive costs of locating and traveling to structures scattered around the world. Theatre Finder is an attempt create the necessary finding aid for these buildings and provide a consistent body of relevant data for them, with digital reconstructions at a consistent scale.\n",

        "description": "Theatre Finder is a comprehensive online guide of all theatres world-wide that are over 100 years old. Collaboratively edited and peer reviewed, it has been designed for both tourist and scholarly audiences. The project combines 25 years of research by two-time MITH fellow, Prof. Franklin J. Hildy of the School of Theatre, Dance, and Performance Studies, with the technical and design expertise of the MITH staff. Theatre Finder is intended to serve as the test platform for CAMP, a Collaborative, Ajax-Based, Modeling Platform, developed separately at MITH with funding from an NEH Level II Digital Humanities Startup Grant. This talk will examine the relationship between content and collaboration, both in terms of the development of content with international scholars and in terms of the relationship between content development and technology support\n",

    "description": "This was a project of Spring 2011 MITH Winnemore Digital Dissertation Fellow Maria Velazquez. Her dissertation, “Electronic Skin: Community Building and Virtual Embodiment” investigated the creative processes through which citizens are made, with particular attention to the role that technologies like blogging, virtual reality, and electronic activism foster the use of “imaginative embodiment” in creating stories of citizenship, selfhood, and action. “Imaginative embodiment” suggests the ways in which performing citizenship involves a mental, emotional, physical, and spiritual investment in incarnating particular political and social ideals. Velazquez’s examineds three areas, the [Go Mamasita! Dance Studio](http://gomamasita.org/), a site envisioned as a place where women of color, particularly African- American women, can reconnect with dance ancestry, a nexus to North African dance traditions, filtered through the lens of digital diaspora; [Red Light Center ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Light_Center)(RLC), an adults-only virtual world, similar in design to World of Warcraft or SecondLife, to discuss the role pre-structuring technology takes in creating erotic virtual cityscapes; and the blogosphere, particularly blogs that grapple with anti-racist discourse, fandom, and popular culture. Through an investigation of these spaces, Velazquez described the ways individuals engage in virtual and “real-world” activism. Actions and behaviors that highlight the ways in which the language of friendship, holism, and community is mobilized in conversations about citizenship, the body, and desire. While a dance studio, a pornographic virtual world, and segments of the blogosphere may seem like a disparate collection of sites for investigation, all three share an abiding interest in the body and its potential as site of pleasure.\n",

        "talk title": "Communities Incarnate",
        "description": "In this talk, Maria Velazquez investigates the creative processes through which citizens are made, with particular attention to the role that technologies like blogging, virtual reality, and electronic activism foster the use of “imaginative embodiment” in creating stories of citizenship, selfhood, and action. “Imaginative embodiment” suggests the ways in which performing citizenship involves a mental, emotional, physical, and spiritual investment in incarnating particular political and social ideals. Velazquez’s examines three areas, the Go Mamasita! Dance Studio, a site envisioned as a place where women of color, particularly African-American women, can reconnect with dance ancestry, a nexus to North African dance traditions, filtered through the lens of digital diaspora; _Red Light Center (RLC)_, an adults-only virtual world, similar in design to _World of Warcraft _or _SecondLife, _to discuss the role pre-structuring technology takes in creating erotic virtual cityscapes; and the blogosphere, particularly blogs that grapple with anti-racist discourse, fandom, and popular culture. Through an investigation of these spaces, Velazquez describes the ways individuals engage in virtual and “real-world” activism. Actions and behaviors that highlight the ways in which the language of friendship, holism, and community is mobilized in conversations about citizenship, the body, and desire. While a dance studio, a pornographic virtual world, and segments of the blogosphere may seem like a disparate collection of sites for investigation, all three share an abiding interest in the body and its potential as site of pleasure.\n",

    "description": "2016-17 Winnemore Digital Dissertation Fellow Avery Dame spent his fellowship year building the [Transgender Usenet Archive](http://transusenet.averydame.net/), a public archive of posts from targeted Usenet newsgroups which grew in popularity during the 1990's upswing in online discussion forums, in this case around groups which were central to the development of a transgender community.\nFrom the earliest days of Fidonet, trans individuals have made spaces for discussion and resource-sharing online. Some of these spaces were hosted on Usenet, a decentralized, worldwide discussion system founded in 1980 and organized around topic-specific newsgroups. [Usenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet), as a communications network, is an influential predecessor to modern social media platforms and the origin point for now-common bits of contemporary Internet vocabulary like \"spam.\"\nThese spaces offered transgender users the opportunity to communicate and find support, without falling into \"maladaptive\" coping strategies. The resulting archive is a record of online discussions in five important transgender-related forums:\n1. Alt.transgendered;\n2. Soc.support.transgendered;\n3. Alt.support.srs;\n4. Alt.support.crossdressing; and\n5. alt.fashion.crossdressing.\nDame's research focuses on how posters use the term \"cisgender\" in their discussions. These groups are one of the few archival locations where participants regularly used the term, and several origin narratives point to different newsgroups as being the where it was first used. His larger dissertation explores the affective and structural meanings assigned to \"community\" in English-language transgender discourse online. Read more about Avery's research, methodologies, and the process of building the archive in the [blog posts](../../tag/transgender-usenet-archive/index.html) completed during his fellowship.\n[Users can access the archive here](http://transusenet.averydame.net/), and can search for any single word or two word phrase. Searches can be filtered by newsgroup or post publication year. By default, all searches are case sensitive, but this setting can be changed under the \"Case\" header on the far right corner next to the \"Search\" button. Each search result under \"click for texts\" includes a link to a plain text file of that message, including date and message subject.\n",

However, what happens to born-digital materials which can technically be accessed—but whose content and format may not be accessible in the contemporary media environment? In this presentation, I’ll talk more about my process working with materials from the Usenet Historical Collection to build the [Transgender Usenet Archive](https://archive.mith.umd.edu/mith-2020/gets-us-talking-cant-bad-building-transgender-usenet-archive/index.html) and conduct my own research. I’ll discuss the technical and ethical challenges I faced in building the archive, as well as how these challenges informed my own research into early use of the term “cisgender” in transgender discourse.\n",

    "description": "Katie King began thinking about feminism and writing technologies while working in the early 80s on her dissertation, which was on academic editorial practices and feminist political practices making these interesting literary objects sometimes called “poems.” She looked specifically at the literary productions and literary histories of Emily Dickinson and Audre Lorde and the social and institutional practices that shaped their work to look like what folks in their time periods and cohorts of action would call “poems.”\nEarlier, throughout the 70s, as an undergraduate in California and then as a graduate student at the University of Chicago King had studied ancient Greek and Old English epic poetry, and then the work of Chaucer, with an eye to investigating oral formulaic poetry. The theoretical approach she took in her dissertation later in the 80s was inspired by the work of her teacher, Donna Haraway, and her analyses of feminist primate researchers, although the methods she used were necessarily rather different in examining literary objects and became elements of her talk about feminism and writing technologies. King was particularly helped by Haraway’s transformations of the work of Bruno Latour and Steve Woolgar’s anthropology of the scientific laboratory in their book, Laboratory Life.\nKing’s [Feminism and Writing Technologies](http://web.archive.org/web/20070609001807/http://www.mith.umd.edu/fellows/king/printshop.html) was an early MITH Faculty Fellow project which featured a virtual 17th-century Quaker women’s printshop designed to plumb more fully (by reconfiguring objects of study) the intertwinings of print and digital distributions of knowledge production and their implications for research in the twenty-first century university.\n",

    "description": "[The _Walt Whitman Archive_](http://www.whitmanarchive.org/) is an electronic research and teaching tool that sets out to make Whitman’s vast work, for the first time, easily and conveniently accessible to scholars, students, and general readers. Working in collaboration with the [University of Texas at Austin](http://www.utexas.edu/cola/depts/english/), as well as the [Center for Digital Research in the Humanities](http://cdrh.unl.edu/) at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, the project team is focusing on Walt Whitman’s annotations and commentary about history, science, theology, and art being discussed during his time. These annotations survived in many forms, either as marginalia and underlinings on books, or as collages of newspaper clippings, or as separate handwritten notes. Studying this material can further our understanding of the poet’s self-education and his compositional methods.\nMITH is now building a digital publication around these precisely encoded data. To do so, we are adapting the tools developed for our own [Shelley-Godwin Archive](https://archive.mith.umd.edu/mith-2020/research/shelley-godwin-archive/index.html). The _Shelley-Godwin Archive_ provides the digitized manuscripts of Percy Bysshe Shelley, Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, William Godwin, and Mary Wollstonecraft, bringing together online for the first time ever the widely dispersed handwritten legacy of this uniquely gifted family of writers. The archive makes use of Linked Open Data principles and emerging standards such as the [Open Annotation](http://www.openannotation.org/) and the [Shared Canvas](http://www.shared-canvas.org/) data models in order to open the contents of the archive to widespread use and reuse. The Linked Open Data drive our rendering engines and is generated directly from the TEI files. By adapting our Shelley-Godwin tools for Whitman, we found that Open Annotation was particularly suited for modeling Whitman’s own annotations, as the data model offered a basic and open system to represent generic annotation acts (for example by relating a piece of Whitman’s commentary to the specific portion of text that it annotates).\nThe final digital publication will allow users to read semi-diplomatic transcriptions of the texts alongside facsimile images, as well as visually distinguish regions of text annotated by Whitman. We are also building a search system that indexes the text according to several categories, so that users may search on text annotated by Whitman as opposed to text written by the author, etc.\n",

    "description": "On April 24, 2004, the University of Maryland held its annual open house for the state’s citizens, Maryland Day, and the David C. Driskell Center and MITH co-produced the Gwendolyn Brooks Poetry Slam, an event designed to bring high school students, university students, and university faculty together to celebrate African-American literary heritage. Supported by grants from the Hechts Company and the Maryland Humanities Council, and by contributions of staff time from Driskell and MITH, the Slam enjoyed an audience of more than 350 (in fact, not all of the attendees could fit into the Driskell Center’s Events Room), and served as the inauguration for the “Spoken Word” workshop with high school students offered in summer 2004 by Corey Roberts, a Driskell Center Fellow and doctoral candidate in Theatre at the University of Maryland.\nBuilding on the highly successful [Poetry Slam honoring Langston Hughes](https://archive.mith.umd.edu/mith-2020/index.html%3Fp=5290.html) and held in the Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center in February 2002 (produced by Driskell & MITH and co-sponsored by Borders), this Slam honored contemporary African-American poet Gwendolyn Brooks. As had the previous Slam, the April 24 event pitted local high school poets selected by competitions within their schools against Terp poets. With fond memories of the February 2002 Langston Hughes Poetry Slam, judges David Driskell and music faculty Carmen Balthrop were joined by filmmaker [Irvin Kershner](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0449984/) for what was an intense battle of words and wits. It was a packed house, as students, their teachers, parents and friends cheered the competitors on. In summer 2004 the poetry slam was followed up with the “Spoken Word” workshop for participants and other high school students, intensive sessions designed to foster students’ abilities to hone poetry for performance.\n",

        "description": "On April 24, 2004, the University of Maryland held its annual open house for the state’s citizens, Maryland Day, and the David C. Driskell Center and MITH co-produced the Gwendolyn Brooks Poetry Slam, an event designed to bring high school students, university students, and university faculty together to celebrate African-American literary heritage. Supported by grants from the Hechts Company and the Maryland Humanities Council, and by contributions of staff time from Driskell and MITH, the Slam enjoyed an audience of more than 350 (in fact, not all of the attendees could fit into the Driskell Center’s Events Room), and served as the inauguration for the “Spoken Word” workshop with high school students offered in summer 2004 by Corey Roberts, a Driskell Center Fellow and doctoral candidate in Theatre at the University of Maryland.\nBuilding on the highly successful [Poetry Slam honoring Langston Hughes](https://archive.mith.umd.edu/mith-2020/index.html%3Fp=5290.html) and held in the Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center in February 2002 (produced by Driskell & MITH and co-sponsored by Borders), this Slam honored contemporary African-American poet Gwendolyn Brooks. As had the previous Slam, the April 24 event pitted local high school poets selected by competitions within their schools against Terp poets. With fond memories of the February 2002 Langston Hughes Poetry Slam, judges David Driskell and music faculty Carmen Balthrop were joined by filmmaker [Irvin Kershner](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0449984/) for what was an intense battle of words and wits. It was a packed house, as students, their teachers, parents and friends cheered the competitors on. In summer 2004 the poetry slam was followed up with the “Spoken Word” workshop for participants and other high school students, intensive sessions designed to foster students’ abilities to hone poetry for performance.\n",

    "description": "This was a project of Patricia Cossard, the first UMD Libraries Faculty Fellow, in Spring 2005. The goal was the creation of a Medieval Studies electronic resource in a thesaurus structure, plus a structure for classifying historical persons and locations for a multinational, multilingual public.\nThe stated need for this was based on Cossard's argument that previous electronic resources in Medieval Studies had been closed source, using closed systems, local standards, unstable access, and irregular archiving. She argued that this closed environment had not served the medieval studies community well, in that the field had traditionally been based on networking and shared sources. The thesaurus attempted to use best-practice from publishing and library sciences to create an open tool for medievalists and associated professionals, such as librarians.\nImagine the ability to search across web-resources using your native modern European language and find appropriate primary and secondary sources in Latin, French, Italian, German, Spanish, English, etc., based upon the meaning rather than the form of the search term. Imagine having a tool that would enable you to search for a concept and be able to construct the forms it has taken historically as well as the ability to link outward for both evidence and argument. Imagine a tool that would enable you to study the slippage of concept which is beyond naming. Imagine having a tool that can deconstruct ontological orders asking for different kinds of readings.\nThe Multilingual Thesaurus for Medieval Studies (MLTMS) is that tool. MLTMS links terms, i.e. word-forms, with the same meaning, i.e. concept, in the core languages of contemporary studies of the Middle Ages. MLTMS enables scholars to search a variety of electronic resources in different languages at a conceptual level whilst being based on both common and technical word-forms in the major languages used by scholars and other interested parties. Cross-language retrieval of search-results is therefore possible from a number of query-languages.

        "description": "MITH is pleased to offer two of its current or recent faculty Fellows the opportunity to discuss their ongoing work in digital humanities. Please join us for these two presentations. \n**\"The Early Americas Digital Archive\"** by Ralph Bauer, Associate Professor of English\nThe Early Americas Digital Archive (EADA) is a collection of electronic texts and links to texts originally written in or about the Americas from 1492 to approximately 1820. It is open to the public for research and teaching purposes. It is intended as a long-term and inter-disciplinary project in progress committed to exploring the intersections between traditional humanities research and digital technologies and invites scholars from all disciplines to submit their editions of early American texts for publication. \n**\"Occupied Japan, 1945-1952: Gender, Class, Race\"** by Marlene Mayo, Associate Professor of History\nThe site contains nineteen themes, biographies of eighteen leading and lesser known women, numerous images, and a wide range of texts ranging from fiction and poetry to oral histories and official documents. The site is intended for use not only in Japanese and East Asian History courses but also for American History, American Studies, Women's Studies, and Comparative Government and Politics.\n",

        "description": "Art has never been a mere mirror up to nature, yet as in no other medium has it been so easy to create a simulacra of reality as with digital technology: a 'heterocosm', both simulating the familiar while deconstructing it. This talk will explore how mimesis might be used as a paradigm from which to explore the relationship between digital surrogates and their analogue counterparts; how familiar terms like object, imitation, copy, original function in the digital realm; and the notion that a digital representation may be more appropriately termed a simulacral identity, reflecting, not the object itself, but our beliefs and conventions about it. This talk will also briefly touch upon mimesis from the viewpoint of digital representations as conscious fashionings of hyper-reality or in Wildean terms, employing the unreal and non-existent to recreate the material world in unexpected, fresh, or subversive ways.\n",

Mellon Foundation](http://mellon.org/) which aims to engage scholars in designing tools for exploration, location, and analytic grouping of materials so they can routinely conduct computational scholarship at scale, based on meaningful worksets.\nMITH will work with Faculty Fellow Peter Mallios and the [Foreign Literatures in America](https://archive.mith.umd.edu/mith-2020/research/fla/index.html) (FLA) team to develop a set of services and interfaces that will allow the FLA project (and other projects like it) to pull metadata records from the HathiTrust, correct and annotate these records using standardized vocabularies, gather corrections and annotations from other teams or scholars, and export enhanced metadata in formats suitable for publication as linked data. The design of this prototype application is intended to leverage the effort of scholars as they identify and select relevant resources from the HathiTrust corpus to create collections (“worksets”) useful for scholarly analyses. Mallios and the FLA team will experiment with using the prototype to continue their work studying the reception of foreign and immigrant authored literary works in the U.S., in interdisciplinary terms that encompass literature, culture, politics, history, and international relations.\nIn addition to leveraging previous collaborations with Mallios and FLA, this work builds directly on previous MITH work by Travis Brown, MITH Assistant Director of Research and Development, on a system for HathiTrust metadata correction developed by as part of a partnership between MITH and the [Princeton Prosody Archive](https://digitalhumanities.princeton.edu/ppa/).\n",

    "description": "The Thomas MacGreevy Archive is a long-term, interdisciplinary research project that explores the life, writings, and relationships of the Irish poet and critic, Thomas MacGreevy (1893-1967). The project is committed to investigating the intersections between traditional humanities research and digital technologies. Begun with generous grants from The Newman Scholarship Fund at [University College Dublin](http://www.ucd.ie/) and [Enterprise Ireland](http://www.enterprise-ireland.ie/english.asp), it partnered with The Intents Project at University College Dublin to develop intelligent search and navigation tools for hyper documents. It is published by the [Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities](http://www.iath.virginia.edu/), at University of Virginia, and supported by the [University of Maryland Libraries](http://www.lib.umd.edu/).\nThe original goal of publishing an on-line bibliography of writings by and about Thomas MacGreevy is nearly complete, with over 400 texts that can be browsed or searched in a variety of ways.\nWith this release, the Archive now features several new collections available through the browse mode, including Thomas MacGreevy Composing a Poem, an edition of several of MacGreevy’s poems that allows readers to trace their composition history; Thomas MacGreevy and Jack B Yeats: An Online Broadsheet, which explores MacGreevy’s and Yeats’s professional and personal relationship, and Who’s Who in the MacGreevy Archive, a database which provides authority files for the names of people and organisations found in the texts. Many of the entries contain biographical notes.\nThe Thomas MacGreevy Archive is fully XML-compliant, with texts encoded according to the [Text Encoding Initiative guidelines](http://tei-c.org/). The Archive uses [Lucene](http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene) to deliver a majority of texts. The collection Thomas MacGreevy Composing a Poem utilises the [Versioning Machine](http://v-machine.org/), open-source software developed at MITH.\n",

This talk will explore how mimesis might be used as a paradigm from which to explore the relationship between digital surrogates and their analogue counterparts; how familiar terms like object, imitation, copy, original function in the digital realm; and the notion that a digital representation may be more appropriately termed a simulacral identity, reflecting, not the object itself, but our beliefs and conventions about it. This talk will also briefly touch upon mimesis from the viewpoint of digital representations as conscious fashionings of hyper-reality or in Wildean terms, employing the unreal and non-existent to recreate the material world in unexpected, fresh, or subversive ways.\n",

Highlights included Katherine Hayle’s keynote (nicely summarized at [jilltxt](https://web.archive.org/web/20111121183914/http://jilltxt.net/?p=1992)), considering the idea of “literary” vs. “literature” and providing very intelligent close readings of a variety of works of electronic literature, readings from new works by Stephanie Strickland, Rob Kendall, Nick Montfort, Deena Larsen, and others, as well as three very good panel discussions. The process-intensive panel looked at the idea of process from several different angles ranging from process-intensive collaboration, to natural language interface processing, to story generation. The international panel featured demonstrations of electronic literature from around the world, including works in Spanish, French, Catalan, and Nordic languages, and also highlighted the fact that electronic literature is a global movement—ELO isn’t the only organization concerned with this work, but has shared interests and opportunities for collaboration with organizations including [nt2](https://web.archive.org/web/20111121183914/http://www.labo-nt2.uqam.ca/), [Elinor](https://web.archive.org/web/20111121183914/http://elinor.nu/), [Hermeneia](https://web.archive.org/web/20111121183914/http://www.uoc.edu/in3/hermeneia/cat/activitats/activitats.html), and others.\nThe Future of Electronic Literature panel was also an engaging discussion of how new technologies might effect electronic literature, and how new ways of organizing material and collaborating might effect the way that we shape the field.\nYou can see photos of the event, posted by [Scott Rettberg](https://web.archive.org/web/20111121183914/http://www.flickr.com/photos/scottrettberg/sets/72157600185961028/), [Jason deVinney](https://web.archive.org/web/20111121183914/http://www.flickr.com/photos/devinney/sets/72157600190099492/), and [Laura Borras](https://web.archive.org/web/20111121183914/http://www.flickr.com/photos/8252982@N08/sets/72157600191451969/).\n",

        "description": "The Electronic Literature Organization's Future of Electronic Literature Symposium at MITH at the University of Maryland, College Park was an event that brought e-lit writers, scholars, and an interested public together for an open mouse/open mic, a daylong symposium, and an ELO board meeting. Highlights included Katherine Hayle's keynote (nicely summarized at [jilltxt](https://web.archive.org/web/20111121183914/http://jilltxt.net/?p=1992)), considering the idea of \"literary\" vs. \"literature\" and providing very intelligent close readings of a variety of works of electronic literature, readings from new works by Stephanie Strickland, Rob Kendall, Nick Montfort, Deena Larsen, and others, as well as three very good panel discussions. The process-intensive panel looked at the idea of process from several different angles ranging from process-intensive collaboration, to natural language interface processing, to story generation. The international panel featured demonstrations of electronic literature from around the world, including works in Spanish, French, Catalan, and Nordic languages, and also highlighted the fact that electronic literature is a global movement -- ELO isn't the only organization concerned with this work, but has shared interests and opportunities for collaboration with organizations including [nt2](https://web.archive.org/web/20111121183914/http://www.labo-nt2.uqam.ca/), [Elinor](https://web.archive.org/web/20111121183914/http://elinor.nu/), [Hermeneia](https://web.archive.org/web/20111121183914/http://www.uoc.edu/in3/hermeneia/cat/activitats/activitats.html), and others.\nThe Future of Electronic Literature panel was also an engaging discussion of how new technologies might effect electronic literature, and how new ways of organizing material and collaborating might effect the way that we shape the field.\n",

        "description": "MITH hosted the first annual Digital Humanities Winter Institute (DHWI), from Monday, January 7, 2013, to Friday, January 11, 2013, at the University of Maryland in College Park, Maryland. We were delighted to be expanding the model pioneered by the highly-successful Digital Humanities Summer Institute ([DHSI](http://www.dhsi.org/)) at the University of Victoria to the United States.\nDHWI provided an opportunity for scholars to learn new skills relevant to different kinds of digital scholarship while mingling with like-minded colleagues in coursework, social events, and lectures during an intensive, week-long event located amid the many attractions of the Washington, D.C. region.\nCourses were open to all skill levels and catered to many different interests. For the 2013 Institute we assembled an amazing group of instructors who taught everything from introductory courses on project development and programming, to intermediate level courses on image analysis, teaching with multimedia, and data curation. DHWI also featured more technically-advanced courses on text analysis and linked open data. Our goal was that the curricula we assembled would appeal to graduate students, faculty, librarians, and museum professionals as well as participants from government and non-governmental organizations.\nAn exciting program of extracurricular events accompanied the formal DHWI courses to capitalize on the Institute’s proximity to the many cultural heritage organizations in the region. This stream of activities, which we called “DHWI Public Digital Humanities,” included an API workshop, a hack-a-thon, and opportunities to contribute videos and other materials to the [4Humanities](http://humanistica.ualberta.ca/) campaign to document the importance of the humanities for contemporary society.\nBoth the outward-looking DHWI Public Digital Humanities program and the week of high-caliber, in-depth digital humanities coursework were kicked off by the Institute Lecture. This year’s speaker was Seb Chan, Director of Digital & Emerging Media at the Smithsonian, Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum in New York City.\n",

    "description": "Also called _Performative Experiments in Humanities Computing: Interactive Templates for Intuitive Learning and Research_, _Emily Dickinson: Technology and Mythobiography_ was a 2001 Faculty Fellowship project of Professor Carol Burbank from the Department of Theatre. Employing two different models of performative technology, a series of interactive templates for student experiments in writing, and a web collage or performance \"fugue,\" Dr. Burbank explored the way pastiche and narrative function within a technological frame. Both tools are were used in one of the University's Core courses, Theatre 110, to encourage functional, yet creative interfaces for scholarship and pedagogy through the use of inherently experiential theatrical and performance paradigms. Professor Burbank's work in this area has also greatly enhanced MITH's Digital Directions project, a three-week residential summer course for high school juniors.\nIn an [archived 2002 version of the project website](https://web.archive.org/web/20020302081244/http://www.mith.umd.edu/burbank/contradictions.html), Burbank describes the project thusly: \"Computer stagings, steeped in the experience of process, scripted in a collaboration between users and designers, could be a medium in which audiences become directors, or perhaps some hybrid between authors and 'spect/actors' to use Augusto Boal's term. If the computer user can become an active participant in critical self-invention and the negotiations of cultural identity, then we can begin to develop a new method of participatory theatre in which presence and immersion is rooted, not in the physical community of live theatre, but in the experience of manipulating images and creating an online community and an ongoing virtual site-specific performance space. In this space, interactive multimedia 'fugues' can serve as mirrors of critical and personal relationships with Emily Dickinson, staging the unconscious mythobiographical imperatives that twist our perceptions, and give us the pleasure of the poet's imaginary company.\"\n",

One film in this series, _They Dreamed Tomorrow_, was produced in 2001 as a MITH Faculty Fellowship project wherein Fuegi and Francis produced a film, website, and DVD chronicling the contributions of Ada, Countess Lovelace (1815-1852), Lord Byron’s daughter, and Charles Babbage (1791-1871) to the early history of computing. The documentary focused on the woman for whom the United States Department of Defense named its programming language ADA and whose image Microsoft uses as its watermark. _To Dream Tomorrow_ was featured in [NEH’s Humanities magazine (January/February 2003)](http://www.neh.gov/humanities/2003/januaryfebruary/feature/the-amazing-adding-subtracting-composing-creating-do).\nJohn and Jo currently serve respectively as President/Treasurer and Vice President/Secretary of the Board of Directors, whose present members are Catherine Good Abbott, Ursula Daniels, Kathryn Maleney, Martha Nell Smith, and Emma Lew Thomas.

    "description": "Digital Diasporas was the first conference of its kind to bring together to discuss on-going projects and also debate the theoretical, methodological, and pedagogical issues raised by the intersection of the fields of Digital Humanities and African American/African Diaspora Studies.\nThe goal of the conference was to address the increasing centrality of digitization to the archiving of materials, as well as the growth of digital technology in the teaching, scholarship and artistic production in the field of African American/African Diaspora Studies.\nThe schedule included a keynote address by Abdul Alkalimat (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign), workshops on text encoding and navigating online resources in African American and African Diaspora Studies, panels and seminars with scholars and funders, a digital \"poster\" session, a book fair, and multi-media art installations and performances by artists and local performers Pamela Z and DJ Spooky.\nOriginally a MITH Fellowship project of Zita Nunes, Associate Professor of English and Comparative Literature, this conference emerged as a full-blown collaboration between MITH and the African American / African Diaspora Area Group of the English Department. It was sponsored by various UMD departments, as well as institutions and scholars from across the US:\n- UMD Office of the Vice President of Research\n- UMD Office of the Associate Provost for Equity and Diversity\n- UMD Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH)\n- UMD English Department\n- UMD Offices of the Dean of Graduate Studies, Dean of Undergraduate Studies, and Dean of the Libraries\n- UMD Student Affairs Office\n- UMD David C. Driskell Center for the Study of the Visual Arts and Culture of African Americans and the African Diaspora\n- UMD Consortium on Race, Gender and Ethnicity\n- UMD Nyumburu Cultural Center\n- WMUC Radio 88.1\n- Johns Hopkins University Center for Africana Studies\n",

        "description": "This conference will address the increasing centrality of digitization to the archiving of materials, as well as the growth of digital technology in the teaching, scholarship and artistic production in the field of African American/African Diaspora Studies. The conference is a collaboration involving the African American/African Diaspora Area Group of the English Department, the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH), and the School of Architecture, Planning & Preservation, as well as other faculty and students from the College of Arts and Humanities (ARHU) and the College of Behavioral and Social Sciences (BSOS).\nThe conference, the first of its kind, will bring together approximately 150 national and international scholars, high school and middle school teachers, artists, students, and funders to discuss a growing body of work that has not as yet benefited from an organized forum that would allow practitioners to meet one another not only to discuss on-going projects, but also to debate the theoretical, methodological, and pedagogical issues raised by the intersection of the fields of Digital Humanities and African American/African Diaspora Studies. As the field of African American/African Diaspora Studies can benefit from a thoughtful consideration of the application of new media tools, so, too, can the field of digital humanities benefit from a focused discussion of scholarship informed by critical race studies.\nThe program will begin with hands-on workshops, including one sponsored by the TEI Consortium and funded by the NEH, which will provide a practical introduction to text encoding and another that will focus on navigating online resources in African American and African Diaspora Studies. The workshops will be followed by a panel showcasing work by scholars in the field of African American/African Diaspora Studies that address and/or make use of digital technologies and new media. The keynote address by Abdul Alkalimat (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) will be followed by a reception and the presentation of a multi-media art installation by the artist, Pamela Z. The last day will be taken up by panels and seminars; an informational box lunch session with leading funders; a digital \"poster\" session, where presenters will use laptops to introduce projects by students, faculty and independent scholars; a book fair; and a closing multi-media performance and book/cd signing by DJ Spooky.\n",

This series of meetings is made possible by generous funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.\nThese day-long public rollouts informed digital humanities and sciences computing developers, curators of digital collections, and scholars using digital content about the W3C Open Annotation Community Group’s work. Topics included the Open Annotation Data Model, the W3C Open Annotation Community Group, existing implementations of Open Annotation producers and consumers, and developer tools and resources.\nAt the U.S. East Coast Rollout in May, MITH presented its [video annotation developer toolkit](http://umd-mith.github.com/OACVideoAnnotator/) developed in conjunction with [Alexander Street Press](http://alexanderstreet.com/). The toolkit provides a JavaScript framework for creating and viewing annotations of video embedded in a web page without having access to the video stream, enabling annotation of proprietary video. MITH also outlined its ongoing work developing a Drupal module that uses this toolkit to enable annotation of video embedded in a website.\n",

        "description": "This Digital Dialogue is also a launch event for Matthew Kirschenbaum's new book _[Track Changes: A Literary History of Word Processing](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674417076)_, sponsored by the English department's Center for Literary and Comparative Studies. Neil Fraistat will be on hand to host, and discuss the book with Matt. Copies will be available! \n**#### About the Book:** \nThe story of writing in the digital age is every bit as messy as the ink-stained rags that littered the floor of Gutenberg’s print shop or the hot molten lead of the Linotype machine. During the period of the pivotal growth and widespread adoption of word processing as a writing technology, some authors embraced it as a marvel while others decried it as the death of literature. The product of years of archival research and numerous interviews conducted by the author, _Track Changes_ is the first literary history of word processing.\nMatthew Kirschenbaum examines how the interests and ideals of creative authorship came to coexist with the computer revolution. Who were the first adopters? What kind of anxieties did they share? Was word processing perceived as just a better typewriter or something more? How did it change our understanding of writing?\n_Track Changes_ balances the stories of individual writers with a consideration of how the seemingly ineffable act of writing is always grounded in particular instruments and media, from quills to keyboards. Along the way, we discover the candidates for the first novel written on a word processor, explore the surprisingly varied reasons why writers of both popular and serious literature adopted the technology, trace the spread of new metaphors and ideas from word processing in fiction and poetry, and consider the fate of literary scholarship and memory in an era when the final remnants of authorship may consist of folders on a hard drive or documents in the cloud.\n",

My proposed solution is to initiate the process of creating the framework to standardize Africa's geo-political history. Creating a broadly-accepted core of knowledge about the geographic, political and migratory history of Africa along a cartographic timeline will provide new insight, methods and solutions to research transformations to the continent, but also the origins of people absorbed into the trans-Atlantic slave trade and the history of the African diaspora. This talk will examine the current state of Digital Humanities in the discipline of African and African Diaspora History by focusing on approaches, strategies and challenges to integrating a proposed project called \"West Africa Historical GIS\" with the [Liberated Africans Project](http://www.liberatedafricans.org/overview.html), which will reconstruct widely dispersed archival evidence from a transnational collection of primary sources made by some of the world's earliest international human rights courts. \nThese combined projects examine the enduring interest in the memory of slavery through evidence that allows rebuilding the life histories for tens of thousands of Liberated Africans throughout the Atlantic World. The long-term outcome will be a dynamic website to explore the history of antislavery and international human rights law, as well as the demography of the post-1807 trans-Atlantic slave trade, principally from the perspective of the Africans involved. _See below for a Storify recap of this Digital Dialogue, including live tweets and select resources referenced by Lovejoy during his talk._\n",

        "talk title": "Of graphs, maps, and 30,000 Muslims",
        "description": "In the course of 14 centuries, Muslim authors wrote, compiled and recompiled a great number of multivolume collections that often include tens of thousands of biographical, bibliographical and historical records. Over the past decade, many of these texts (predominantly in Arabic) have become available in full text format through a number of digital libraries. The overall number of texts in these libraries amounts to thousands with their overall volume exceeding 1,5 billion words. Scholars of Islam and Islamic history have already realized the value of the newly available resources, but it is the new digital methods of engaging with these texts that offer the qualitative change of the field by opening research opportunities that were unthinkable a mere decade ago. In particular, various text-mining techniques allow us to study such multivolume collections in their entirety, making it possible to engage into the data-driven exploration of the “longue durée” of Islamic history. Following the general introduction into the digital Islamic humanities, the lecture will then zoom in on the results of the computational analysis of the largest premodern biographical collection—“The History of Islam” of the Damascene scholar al-Ḏahabī (d. 1348 CE), who covered 700 years of Islamic history through over 30,000 biographical records. The riches of this collection hold the keys to understanding of both the Islamic written tradition as well as the history of the Islamic society. What was the Islamic society in the course of 700 years of its history? How was it changing in time and space? What were the major cultural centers? Did they remain the same or passed on the baton among each other? Focusing on these and other questions, the lecture will showcase a variety of analyses possible through text mining and algorithmic reading, pondering on the implications of novel digital methods for the field of Islamic studies.\n",

        "description": "In the recent past, black people have created and utilized a variety of digital spaces and media to reconfigure the terms and terrain of debates and discussions on what it means to be human. How do we as scholars, educators, librarians and archivists use specific cases and experiences to teach habits of critical thought and practice about the intersections between race and technology? This talk is at once a theoretical and practical reflection on an Africana/Black Studies-centered approach to the digital humanities in and outside the classroom. It, then, is a forum for considering the black digital humanities as the use of digital tools and platforms to teach and produce scholarship about the complex histories, societies, and cultures of people of African descent in the United States, Africa and the larger Diaspora. However, I hope to also think about the black digital humanities as concerned with how theories of race and blackness come to bear on and transform technological activity and processes, affording us opportunities to ask new and different questions about humanity.\n",

        "description": "Books and shows about the history of information technology have usually focused on great inventors and technical breakthroughs, from Charles Babbage and Alan Turing to Steve Jobs and the World Wide Web. Computer operations work has been written out of the story, but without it no computer would be useful. Information historians Thomas Haigh and Mark Priestley are writing it back in. This talk focused on ENIAC, the first general purpose electronic computer, based on research for their book _ENIAC in Action: Making and Remaking the Modern Computer_, published by MIT Press in January, 2016. They will explain that the women now celebrated as the “first computer programmers” were actually hired as computer operators and worked hands-on with the machine around the clock. Then they will look at business data processing work from the 1950s onward, exploring the growth of operations and facilities work during the mainframe era. Concluding comments will relate this historical material to the human work and physical infrastructure today vanishing from public view into the “cloud.”\n",

        "description": "In 2013, Ms. Frankle gave her first Digital Dialogue, “Making History with the Masses: Citizen History and Radical Trust in Museums.” Three years later, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has taken the theory of citizen history into practice with the launch of a full-scale citizen history project, History Unfolded: US Newspapers and the Holocaust. During that time, the Museum undertook a learning journey to test assumptions about community engagement, crowdsourcing, and digital development. “Making History with the Masses Revisited” reviews the theory and practice of citizen history as updated for 2016, and outlines a path forward for citizen history as a methodology in public history.\nCitizen history is, as ever, a contract and a dialogue, where the participant is more than a user or contributor and is instead elevated to a full partner in the process of discovery. This time, though, the process of learning from participants begins before they even open the project site. By listening to and learning from communities from the first steps of a citizen history project, institutions can better serve not only the needs of the project or their participants, but the larger body of historical inquiry and their institutions’ larger goals of engagement and relevance. This talk will also touch on the nuts and bolts of creating a citizen history project: who needs to be in the room where it happens? What does success look like? And how do you ensure the waltz of marketing, digital development, historical inquiry, and participant engagement is in time from the first beat to the last chord?\n",

        "description": "For some time, there has been a pressing need for studies that approach murder as something other than a pathological, criminological, or sociological problem to be explained, analyzed, and resolved. In this talk, I take up a new materialist approach to murder, arguing, first, that we must begin by postponing blame, and, second, that inner-city murder is distributed through multiple key non-human rhetorical agents before and leading up to the violent act itself–and that any meaningful intervention must first account for and trace these agents. Using new materialist rhetoric, affect theory, and discourse analysis, I share my research on murder as it happens across, and in part because of, the partial agency of social networks, where language, discourse, and affect intra-act and resonate contagiously. Through a case study of a 2014 “murder-event” in Pittsburgh, PA, I illustrate how Facebook and Twitter become agential actors in murder themselves. Ultimately, my research suggests that individual agency is no longer sufficient and that we must, instead listen to other powerful rhetorical agents and their networks, which have thus far been excluded, as a new intervention into violence in the 21st century.\n",

There are on-line image archives, research databases, digital editions, tools for computational analysis, and even social media sites devoted to the serious study of music, in all its richness. But what good are such tools? And how do they relate to the peer-reviewed journals, books, and monuments with which they jostle for attention and resources?\nI would like to offer some perspectives on the promise and peril of the digital domain for the study of music, highlighting some current accomplishments and pointing out some challenges for the years ahead. Along the way we will pause to consider the long history of transformative intersections of music and technologies of writing and reproduction. And we will reflect on the how these new modes new tools might enable new kinds of disciplinary collaborations, new relationships among teaching and research, and new models of intellectual property and publication.\n",

        "description": "> \"In the context of research, a model is an experimental device, modelling an experimental technique.\" Willard McCarty, Humanities Computing\nWhat is a research model, and what is an experiment, in the context of art history? As we begin to compute data troves derived from catalogues raisonné and museum collections in new ways, we are challenged to grapple seriously with how to map different computational models (e.g. spatial, network, visual) to historical models of society, market, religion, gender, and more.\nMy talk will focus on my in-progress dissertation “Modeling the Network of Dutch and Flemish Print Production, 1500–1700”, in which I adapt existing museum collections databases in order to analyze large-scale changes in the organizational patterns of reproductive printmakers and publishers in the Netherlands during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. I will discuss the importance of formal network concepts to understanding artistic print production, and demonstrate how multiple analytical perspectives, including both measurement and descriptive analysis, as well as simulation modeling, compel us to revisit standing narratives and methodologies. This attentiveness towards computational modeling and the concept of the humanistic model in general, I will argue, has particularly high stakes for art historians as we continue to construct and evaluate the relationships between our historical narratives and the objects from which we derive them.\n",

        "description": "As academic publishing turns more and more toward peer-to-peer review, multimedia-rich work, and publication of data sets, the Vega team is developing a modular, open-source platform that can accommodate a broader range of publishing models that scholars and practitioners want to and can publish. Vega will be a free, editorial-management platform that supports peer review, copy-editing, and publication of multimedia-rich and data-driven scholarship and creative works in all areas of research. With the support of an Andrew W. Mellon Foundation grant, Vega is being designed with a unique editorial workflow that recognizes and values the importance of screen-based multimedia research, including digital humanities projects and electronic literature. What many journals and presses that publish this kind of work lack is an editorial management system that will move a piece of scholarly multimedia through the submission, review, and production processes as a single, scholarly entity. I will discuss the platform, its authorial and editorial features, and welcome questions and comments from an audience of potential users of Vega, which is only part-way through its first year of a three-year development cycle.\n",

        "description": "Scholars of contemporary fiction face special challenges in making the turn toward digitized corpora and empirical method. Their field is one of exceptionally large and uncertain scale, subject to ongoing transformation and dispute, and shrouded in copyright. I will present one possible way forward, based on my work for a special issue of _Modern Language Quarterly_ on \"Scale & Value\" that I'm co-editing with Ted Underwood. My project uses quantitative relationships among mid-sized, hand-made datasets to map the field of Anglophone fiction from 1960 to the present. Some significant findings of this research concern a shift in the typical time-setting of the novel and a concomitant change in the relationship between literary commerce and literary prestige. \n",

        "description": "The study of computational media still has far to go when it comes to contradicting the solo white male inventor myths that are often reified in mainstream culture, although recent work in media archaeology that emphasizes the manual labor of participants with the apparatus is changing the narrative about the rise of software culture. It is perhaps useful to make comparisons to film studies, where scholarship about the role of labor, organizational communication, institutional rhetoric, domestic politics, systems of credit, and “below the line” production activities has long challenged the model of the lone auteur. Just as women were critical actors in the Hollywood saga in intensely collaborative roles such as casting and editing, pioneering work in computer graphics, virtual reality, interactive entertainment, and multimedia publishing reflected a collective production culture and its associated conflicts. Media studies could still do much more to recover social histories currently stored in informal archives, often in obsolete file formats, to support feminist scholarship, as part of the larger theoretical project of acknowledging the material, embodied, affective, situated, and labor-intensive character of technology. This talk focuses specifically on manual labor in the supply chain of digital media and how many hands don’t make light work.\n",

        "description": "> _“How can you love a work, if you don’t know it? How can you know it, if you can’t get near it? How can you get near it, without editors?” _— Gary Taylor, “The Renaissance and the End of Editing”\nScholarly editors are an integral part of the continuum that keeps the stories of the past available to and understood by the present—but in Taylor’s formulation, the “you” is just as important: that public of readers beyond the academy whose interest keeps the humanities alive and relevant. This talk will explore how we can design digital archives and editions to be more than simply publicly accessible. With changes to how we do digital humanities interface design, we can take the extra step of inviting and assisting participation in our love for the nuances of a text’s materiality, history, and meaning.\nI'll address how my \"[Infinite Ulysses](https://mith.umd.edu/dialogues/dd_spring-2015-amanda-visconti/www.infiniteulysses.com)\" digital edition draws on participatory design, social mechanics successful on non-academic sites, and user testing to support a public audience. We'll consider how to design scaffolding for teaching the public the rhetoric scholars use to critically engage texts, with an eye toward moving projects from unfocused public calls to \"have your say\" to teaching critical discussion: \"here's how to have your say, if you want to take part in the conversation, if you want a response, if you want to build on what's been said and have someone build off your thoughts in turn, if you want to learn how to follow up on a theory or question\". We'll also think about what substantive information can be drawn from public commentary that doesn't use the commonplaces of scholarly critique, through techniques such as analyzing sentiment and data on how readers move around a digital edition website. \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\n_NOTE: This talk was originally scheduled for April 7, 2015, but had to be canceled due to a campus-wide power outage. _\n",

        "description": "The Central Building Office at Auschwitz was for its time one of the largest architectural offices in Europe with over 150 SS architects and engineers employed as well as an equal number of forced-labor draftsmen. It was these architects who literally built the infrastructure of imperialist expansion in the East, as well was the brutal complementary structures of the Jewish genocide. This talk analyzes the documentary evidence of the imperial ambitions of the SS as well as the digital visualizations of that archival evidence. Building off of his current work on digitally mapping the site (with his co-author, Anne Kelly Knowles), Jaskot asks what is at stake for digital mapping in the humanities, as well as for a spatial and architectural understanding of the Holocaust. \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n_Please note that this Digital Dialogue is a special co-sponsored talk in conjunction the Art History & Archaeology Department, and occurs on a different weekday and location.

        "description": "What is the future of sheet music? The flexibility of the digital medium, as opposed to the rigidity of the printed form, calls for a more modern concept of the music score.\nEven digital sheet music, in most cases, is designed to be printed; it is either produced with typesetting software, or made of images scanned from a printed source. This type of digital score exists in digital form almost exclusively for distribution. The difference between print and digital distribution is access: scores can be downloaded and printed at home.\n_Digital consumption_, on the other hand, entails reading and performing the score directly from its digital manifestation. Small businesses are already investing in technologies to make the score follow the performer while playing, to support writing and displaying annotations by the performer, a teacher, other peers, etc.\nIn this talk, I’ll address the current status of digital sheet music publication and ask: can the digital consumption of a changeable, customizable publication influence a performer’s advocacy of a work? Textual scholarship and the preparation of critical editions is a fundamental component of this discussion, where I’ll convey editorial transparency as a vital function of digital consumption.\n",

        "description": "Walter Freeman, the world’s foremost proponent and practitioner of lobotomy, was also an obsessive photographer. He almost invariably took photos of his patients before and after surgery, often tracking them down years after the operation to capture their images. These cross-country trips to photograph patients, which Freeman called head-and-shoulder hunting expeditions, consumed the physician during the last years of his career.\nWhat do we do with an archive like this? Its contents can tell us volumes about the medical epistemology that made lobotomy thinkable. But how can we avoid replicating Freeman’s own rhetorical moves, in which the photographs were mobilized as evidence during scientific presentations?\nI’ll describe the visual rhetoric that defined the scientific moment from which lobotomy emerged, and demonstrate some digital methods I’ve used for placing them in context. Against the background of this history, I ask, what is the contemporary digital scholar’s responsibility for working with, writing about, and displaying images of human beings in distress?\n",

        "description": "While “smart” cities and urban “sentience” seem to be products of new networked technologies, our cities have actually been mediated, and intelligent, for millennia. They’ve long been shaped by their roles as substrates for and containers of mediation, and they’ve long reflected the logics, politics, and aesthetics of their prevailing communications technologies. I advocate for an “urban media archaeology,” a materialist, multisensory approach to exploring the deep material history – that is, a cultural materialist history that acknowledges the physicality, the “stuff” of history and culture – of our media cities. This talk offers a preview of _Deep Mapping the Media City_, a book forthcoming (in March 2015) from the University of Minnesota Press’s Forerunners series, in which I investigate our material urban spaces as infrastructures for mediation, and I propose that archaeological tools, like excavation and mapping, might help us to acknowledge and understand our smart, mediated cities in the longue durée.\n",

        "description": "In 1934, a little-known Belgian bibliographer named Paul Otlet described something very much like the World Wide Web, sketching out plans for a network of \"electric telescopes\" connecting people to a vast collection of documents, images, and audio-visual material. He dubbed the whole thing the Mundaneum, describing it as a \"réseau mondial\" -- a worldwide web. Why should anyone still pay attention to the failed schemes of a long-dead Belgian bibliographer? Otlet's work matters today not just as a kind of historical curio, but because he envisioned a radically different kind of network: one driven not by corporate profit and personal vanity, but by a utopian vision of intellectual progress, social egalitarianism, and even spiritual liberation. This presentation will delve deep into Otlet's alternative vision of a global network, in search of useful lessons that could reshape our understanding of what the Web could yet become.\n",

        "description": "Andrew Johnston will discuss a portion of his forthcoming book, _Pulses of Abstraction: Episodes from a History of Animation_, which traces the emergence of real-time computer graphics and animation in the 1970s. Focusing especially on a programming language developed through funding from the National Science Foundation and that language’s use at the art and engineering collective called the Circle Graphics Habitat at the University of Illinois, Chicago, this presentation provides an archaeology of how time and models of perception are coded within early digital graphics systems. The talk will show how animation was fundamental to the creation of these real-time systems, not only because filmmakers worked on the code and platforms that were used, but also because these technologies were built around understandings of time and action taken from cinema. Through an analysis of this history, the presentation argues that real-time computer graphics mark an epistemological shift around the interdependencies of film and other media as well as a broader transformation in the mid-twentieth century of how technologies were modeling perception.\n",

        "talk title": "From Transformative Works to #transformDH",
        "description": "The identity of the field, network, discourse, or discipline of “Digital Humanities” is a source of endless discussion among its practitioners and critics – from conflicting genealogies of humanities computing and new media studies, to the gendered and raced institutional logics critiqued in the recent Differences issue on “The Dark Side of Digital Humanities.” This talk aims to chart an alternative path through the welter of definitional tangles by reinterpreting the world of digital humanities by taking seriously one of its more informal dimensions: the fervor with which digital humanist nerds and geeks appreciate their objects of study. I argue that digital humanities is a fandom – and that there is much to learn from attending to its processes and practices through the lenses developed both by fan studies scholars and by fans themselves. Participants in creative fan communities have theorized their own knowledge production as in conversation with, yet distinct from both media industrial and academic models; drawing from these approaches enables us to understand “digital humanities” as a phenomenon that need not be contained within the bounds of the academy. Drawing attention to the examples of the fannish nonprofit Organization for Transformative Works and the digital humanities network #transformDH, I will pay special attention to the theory and praxis of critical fandom: the ways in which members of fan communities use diverse creative techniques to challenge and critique the structures and representations around which their communities are organized. Understanding digital humanities as critical fandom makes it possible to focus on the affective dimensions that shape it and the contradictory logics that permeate its relationship to the disciplines and institutions that provide its context.\n",

        "talk title": "Without Innovation",
        "description": "This is the second talk in a series. (The first was a TEDx talk given at Amherst College in 2013). Each talk is a speculation on a set of questions about technology, embodiment, and temporality. How can we build a future when we have already had a past? How might we account for how unremembered pasts impact the good work we desire for the future? How do we think about future in a time when futures arrive more and more quickly? What happens to metaphor? To history?\nIn this talk I take as my conceptual starting point Angela Davis’ reading of Frederick Douglass’ telling of his own movement into human freedom, a tale that ends with his assertion that “however long I might remain a slave in form, the day had passed forever when I could be a slave in fact.” I end with a consideration of what is at stake in recognizing emergent parallels between the historical lives of African Americans and how the industrialization of the Internet has enabled our growing desire to optimize every object as intelligent extension of a masterful self.\nIn her mapping of the distance between form and fact, between an enslaved person’s legal status as an object and his or her reflexive humanity, Davis makes her reader aware of a vast and shifting network of power, the net effect of subject-object relations in a society itself structured by inequality. In the context of my talk, this is a way of thinking about how a person might be at the center of an innovation, while at the same time remaining on the outside of that innovation, not experiencing life as the proper and ratified subject of such transformation. This is also a place for thinking about how notions of core and periphery, which had in previous generations been associated with the flow of raw materials and finished goods, is continually reified in today’s exponentially technologized and informationalized world.\nWhat would it mean to juxtapose Davis’ and many others’ explications of such networks with contemporary interest in developing new kinds of subject-object relations, in this case the Internet of Things? More than just catchy phrasing, “Internet of Things” also hints at something important about what we already imagine the Internet to be. The Internet of Things and its contingent If This Then That (IFTTT) programming standard is designed to make the control of connected objects second nature to users, and to use automation to generate feelings of intimacy by allowing the responsiveness of objects to occur through mechanisms transparent to those users. What kinds of historical precedent do we have for this collapse of distance between the digital, psychic, and mechanical worlds?

        "description": "Steph Ceraso will discuss her in-progress book project, _Sounding Composition, Composing Sound_, which re-imagines the teaching of listening in relation to digital media and multimodal experience. Drawing from the listening and composing practices of deaf percussionist Evelyn Glennie, acoustic designers, and automotive acoustic engineers, Ceraso proposes an expansive, explicitly embodied listening pedagogy that is based on the concept of _multimodal listening_—attending to the sensory, material, and contextual aspects that comprise and shape a sonic event. Unlike ear-centric listening practices in which listeners’ main goal is to hear and interpret audible sound (often language), multimodal listening moves beyond the exclusively audible by emphasizing the ecological relationship between sound, bodies, and environments. In this talk, Ceraso will demonstrate how multimodal listening practices enable students to become more thoughtful, savvy consumers _and_ producers of sound in digital composing environments and in their everyday lives.\n",

        "talk title": "Prosopography and Crowding Attention",
        "description": "Almost a century ago, Virginia Woolf lamented the absence of biographies of housemaids in the great national prosopography circa 1900, _The Dictionary of National Biography_. Recent feminist scholarship continues to overlook other widespread records of women's lives in print well before 1900, in collective biographies. Booth's book, How to Make It as a Woman, called attention to this genre of prosopography, a rich repository of networked nonfiction narratives with far more varied female roles than in novels or sermons of the same period. [Collective Biographies of Women](http://cbw.iath.virginia.edu/cbw_db) (CBW) (Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities) is a digital platform for research on more than 8600 persons and 13,400 narratives in 1200 books (most by men, published primarily 1830-1940) in the [bibliography](http://womensbios.lib.virginia.edu) (Scholars' Lab). CBW devised an XML stand-aside schema, Biographical Elements and Structure Schema (BESS), to develop a morphology of this genre, locating types of elements of biography at the level of the paragraph, within samples of collections. In planned collaboration with [Social Networks and Archival Contexts](http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/snac) and other prosopographies, we will contribute the only comprehensive study of printed biographies of women to the quest for global unique identifiers for all known persons.\nThis talk addresses the implications of digital prosopography. CBW's approach captures narrative forms and ideology in printed books that constructed anachronistic documentary social networks: representational cohorts with different degrees of separation rather than archival records indicating networks of correspondence, kinship, or other historical links. Examples from BESS analysis of networks of biographies in sample corpora (Frances Trollope, Sister Dora, and Lola Montez as nodal women in selected texts with hundreds of short biographies of women) will illustrate the project. CBW bridges distant and close reading, in a mid-range reading to investigate how printed books reshaped representations of women for Anglophone readers.\n",

        "description": "Car movies—movies that subordinate plot and character to chases and collisions—typically appear in cycles that coincide with breakthroughs in visual effects production, concomitant changes in production cultures, and—not coincidentally—devastating advancements in corporate globalization. Comparing the construction and ideological framing of automotive effects from the 1970s and 2000s US car movie cycles, I demonstrate how digital effects cultures are promoting neoliberal economies of spectacle through the same tropes their predecessors established to critique corporate culture. This analysis refutes prior critical dismissals of spectacle as mere visual stimulation, suggesting that its sensation also inspires political feelings\n",

        "description": "Emerson will discuss her current two-part book project, titled OTHER NETWORKS, and how it moves through both technical and user-based accounts of networks that outside of or before the Internet, asking both how and for whom each network works (in this case the “whom” will mostly be writers and artists). The project then looks at how the shift from rhetoric that celebrates liberationism via telecommunications networks in the 70s and 80s to rhetoric that calls for libertarianism via the Internet starting in the early to mid-90s may have actually been a kind of release of a repression. While you can trace an almost complete reversal of the meaning of ‘free’ and ‘open’ in relation to distributed networks to communitarian and even socialist, networks in the early 70s such as Community Memory and Project Cybersyn, you can also trace an even earlier reversal – perhaps the true seed of what’s called “cyberlibertarianism” – to the 1960s, in the conceptualization and design of ARPANet and ARPA-related networks that, in the spirit of the managerial theory of the day (just as much or perhaps more than in the spirit of the 1960s counter-culture), emphasized creativity, cooperation, and community. In short, the history of how the Internet came to be has yet to be told and it’s truly anything but linear and uninterrupted.\n",

        "description": "The digital humanities has its roots in fields of study dedicated to textual analysis and historical examination. The present moment is filled with DH practitioners creating visualizations of 'big data,' mapping connections between people and ancient cities, and building archives dedicated to long-dead authors. These worthwhile academic and practical pursuits point us to the center of the digital humanities landscape. But, if we move to the margins and begin to look at the projects and tools that emerge from indigenous communities, archivists and cultural specialists, we see a different pattern: images are purposely removed, archives are not 'open to the public,' maps of sacred sites are consciously not created, defined or linked to. How do we integrate these varied practices and philosophies into the possibilities offered by digital humanities scholars? It is one thing to call attention to difference, it is another to alter our display practices, question access parameters, and redefine our own ways of knowing based on systems of accountability that define an ethical field of visuality based on _not looking_. If seeing is believing and a picture is worth a thousand words, what can we learn from the act of not looking, or perhaps, more specifically, not seeing? In this presentation, I suggest an ethics of access that begins with jettisoning the notion of seeing/looking/knowing, to one that builds from indigenous systems of knowledge management to create a dynamic field for digital humanities relationships to flourish.\n",

        "talk title": "What Falls Out: Preserving Our Digital Heritage with BitCurator",
        "description": "Take a moment and open your bottom desk drawer, the one with your old files in it. Rummage around for a bit and push way back until you see the inevitable papers, notes and detritus that have slipped out of various file folder and now lay at the bottom of the drawer. You will undoubtedly find papers back there, but you may also have a floppy disk or two, maybe a CD-ROM from a project long since set aside, or perhaps a flash memory card that has slipped between the folders. However, unlike the paper that surrounds them, these digital media are increasingly inaccessible as the hardware and software needed to access the data they contain are lost to disrepair, obsolescence and bit rot. It is worth taking a moment, while it is still at least possible to recover the data on these legacy drives, to think about what they contain: drafts of work since published, data accumulated over the course of a project, images and design work once painstakingly pored over. Like the leavings at the bottom of a drawer, these digital objects are frequently “what falls out” as we create, research, record and publish our digital work.\nDrawing on examples from a number of disciplines, this talk addresses both the necessity of preserving our digital heritage contained on legacy media and the means by which that preservation can be accomplished using the [BitCurator environment](http://wiki.bitcurator.net/), which is a customized Linux distribution designed to bring open source digital forensics tools to collecting institutions. The BitCurator environment is the product of the [BitCurator project](http://www.bitcurator.net./): a joint effort led by the School of Information and Library Science at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (SILS) and the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) to develop a system for collecting professionals that incorporates the functionality of many digital forensics tools.\n",

        "description": "> \"Epidemics, like wars, mark a generation for life.\" \nThe AIDS Memorial Quilt was created 25 years ago as a work of community activism to protest the appalling lack of attention by the US health agencies to what was then, in 1987, an increase in improbable fatalities among previously healthy gay men in the United States. Its first inception unfolded in October 1987 on the National Mall in Washington DC as part of the March for Gay Rights; it included 1,920 Quilt panels. Now 25 years later, the Quilt encompasses more than 48,000 panels, representing 60 countries and commemorating more than 93,000 names. It is the largest living memorial of its kind in the world.\nThe Quilt is also an “activist archive” of the late 20th century. The activities that gave rise to the Quilt in 1987 are part of the history of the campaign for gay and lesbian rights in the US. The Quilt literally stitches together a million memories, a million stories, a million lessons about the relationship between individual lives, public culture, and political activism. In its textile form, it is an unwieldy archive. If laid out in its entirety the Quilt would cover more than 1.3 million square feet. It weighs more than 34 tons.\nThis presentation discusses the creation of an interactive memorial that was designed to augment the viewing of the textile Quilt. I will demonstrate three digital experiences: 1) an open-source mobile web application called AIDS QUILT TOUCH; 2) a tangible tabletop interactive that enables viewers to SEARCH the database of Quilt images to find a specific image and to BROWSE the archive of Quilt panel images; and 3) a community sourcing application that engages people in analyzing and archiving information about the Quilt.\nThis effort is framed by my recent transmedia book project called _Designing Culture: The Technological Imagination At Work_. In creating the Quilt Digital Experiences I was interested in exploring the cultural work of public interactives, to examine how they are implicated in practices of cultural reproduction—remembering, witnessing, archiving, and educating.\n",

        "description": "The American Folklife Center Archives, established in the Library of Congress in 1928, is home to millions of items of ethnographic and historical documentation, including folk songs, stories, and other creative expressions of people from diverse communities. Providing access at digital scale to a myriad of audiovisual formats in the context of complicated cultural and copyright issues inherent in documentation of expressive culture is a significant challenge. So is ensuring that the archives continues to collect and provide access to contemporary folk culture documentation in ways that meet the changing demands of scholars. Toward that end, AFC has recently piloted a distributed model of field collecting that relies on documentarians across the country to provide new cultural documentation to the archives via a web-based tool. AFC also hopes to embark on a \"vernacular web\" archiving project that enlists digital culture scholars to help shape and guide collection priorities. This Digital Dialogue will focus on archival collecting efforts that increasingly rely on curatorial partnerships with scholars.\n",

        "description": "It seems we have quite a bit to say about things that don’t exist. This is fine as long we don’t confuse ourselves — and, indeed, idiom and metaphor are indispensable to ordinary communication. But increasingly information systems design, policies, procedures, and documentation are based on logic-based knowledge representation strategies that are profoundly literal, and profoundly unforgiving. Accommodating these strategies will require developing ontologies that revise our common sense conceptual schemes in ways that are sure to be unsettling. These ontologies may be more accurate, and, in the long run they may even be more serviceable, but they will not be familiar, and they will require substantial revision of our descriptions of common activities and processes.\n",

        "description": "Crowdsourcing is a hot not-so-new trend that’s been heralded as a solution for funding creative works of all kinds, from films to games to manufactured products. Popular sites like Kickstarter and IndieGoGo are also venture-funded startups that facilitate distributed contribution to ideas, providing the appearance of investment or pre-orders. But even as more and more individuals source and fund projects through sites like Kickstarter, few realize that the satisfaction (or disappointment) they take away from the process has more to do with the experience of kickstarting, rather than from the product itself. As crowdfunding becomes its own form of entertainment irrespective of whether or not projects succeed or fail, the projects created risk becoming empty shells, lies that can never produce the results they promise because their existence was never meant to produce them in the first place. This talk offers a philosophy of crowdfunding as entertainment, and then presents a new project in development at Georgia Tech as a part of the Intel Science and Technology Center for Social Computing that tries to apply some of these lessons from popular personal electronics projects, including Kickstarted products like Twine, and related projects like Arduino and Raspberry Pi.\n",

        "description": "Social media is international: users from hundreds of different cultures and language backgrounds are generating and sharing content. As a result, language and national borders emerge in the communication landscape online. What can we do to make those borders more porous? Expatriates, migrants, minorities, diasporic communities, and language learners play an important role in forming transnational networks, by creating social ties across nations and communities. A closer look to their connections and interactions online might illuminate us in many ways, i.e. how to increase intercultural awareness, information diffusion across language borders, and promote international relations, outreach or activism at a global scale. Focusing on the personal social network of multilingual Twitter users, I will discuss how social network analysis unveils the intersections of language groups. In general, the use of social network analysis to discover patterns of intercultural connections constitutes an enriching approach that can be applied in many disciplines. Also, I will talk about the influence of the social network on the language choices of multilingual users, with particular attention to the use of English as a Lingua Franca. Finally, I will invite the audience to reflect on what prevents or encourages translation behaviors and cross-cultural awareness in the social media context.\n",

        "description": "Designing and building information technologies involves an ethical component, as designers (consciously or un-) make values choices that influence the uses and impacts of their designs. This talk will discuss how the practices of design affect the social values materialized in emerging technologies, and explore how design practices can encourage ethical reflection and action. The talk will present data from two participant-observation projects. The first observed a laboratory that engineered software for mobile phones to track users' locations, habits, and behaviors. The second examines the social values considered in the design of a future Internet architecture. In both cases, technical work raised ethical challenges ranging from avoiding surveillance to encouraging equity. The projects suggest that particular activities within design can help engineers agree on social values as important to design. I characterize these activities as values levers: practices that open new conversations about social values, and encourage consensus around those values as design criteria. Laboratory leaders and advocates can enable and strengthen these levers to encourage ethical reflection and action as an explicit part of design practice.\n",

        "description": "In February 2012, as the new manager of DCMR, I was tasked with revamping the digitization center, increasing production, expanding services throughout the Libraries, and expanding services to include audio and video digitization, in addition to managing digitization projects. After consulting with stakeholders throughout the Libraries, just over one year later, we have expanded our staff, acquired new equipment, are in a newfacility, and are testing production-level workflows and standards. Our digitization center is modeled on other, larger digitization centers, but scaled to fit the Libraries’ estimated, near-future needs.\nMy colleagues and I have also worked to define the separation of digital unit responsibilities between production and preservation, digitization and digital projects. Though DCMR focuses solely on production-based on content-managers’ requests, we maintain a larger focus on overall digital operations. Beyond digitization request orders for patrons, many of the larger projects we undertake frequently include other presentation or digital humanities components. Some of these projects include: the digitization of Katherine Ann Porter’s correspondence to create a digital scholarly edition, in collaboration with various other units and departments; digitizing a collection of Civil War-era letters and diaries that may be used in future classes as education exercises to perform transcription and TEI; and digitizing multiple formats and series of materials throughout a broadcasting collection, providing an extensive picture of the collection for a Special Collections exhibit.\n",

        "description": "Museums as institutions of the 21st century have progressed quite a ways from the Wunderkammer of generations before. The 21st century museum takes the audience as its starting point and seeks out ways to rely upon its collections and the expertise of its staff to teach not only content but also skills; to be a venue not just for silent contemplation of its artifacts but where conversations that help to define and shape society may find a starting point and a home. Even with this more open approach to dialogue around collections, museums still struggle with how far to allow their visitors into their scholarship and their “stuff,” fearing for their status as authorities in their fields should amateurs be welcomed into that part of the conversation.\nFor history museums, Citizen History is one way to bring users worldwide into a dialogue based upon the museum’s collections and ongoing scholarship. Building from practices established in citizen science, Citizen History engages amateur scholars and enthusiasts in contemplating and answering authentic questions, building from research and resources held by the museum as authority but being open to the new ideas, questions, and ways of thinking brought by these new collaborators. Moreover, these projects help to grow online communities and stakeholders for the host institution, and promote expansion of open access to digital resources in order to provide users with as many tools as possible to help the museum answer its questions.\nIn her Digital Dialogue, Ms. Frankle will discuss her experiences and discoveries as the community manager of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum’s first experimental Citizen History project, “Children of the Lodz Ghetto: A Memorial Research Project.” She will also explore best practices for establishing and managing Citizen History projects, and how to work cross-departmentally within a museum, library, or archive to build and sustain a platform that helps both the institution and its users to grow.\n",

        "description": "In January 2012, the International Center for the Arts of the Americas (ICAA) at the Museum of Fine Arts Houston launched the Documents of 20th-Century Latin American and Latino Art Digital Archive and Publications Project. Available online ([icaadocs.mfah.org](http://icaadocs.mfah.org)), the Documents Project is dedicated to the recovery and dissemination of primary source materials related to modern and contemporary Latin American and Latino art. A working group was established in the greater Washington, DC area last July, and the University of Maryland is part of a consortium of institutional partners that includes the Archives of American Art (Smithsonian Institution), the Organization of American States, the Inter-University Program for Latino Research (University of Notre Dame), and George Mason University.\nThis talk will introduce the ICAA Documents Project and its recovery initiative in the Washington area. Undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Maryland have worked on this project over the academic year 2012-13, and their contributions – from archival discovery to digitization and scholarly analysis – will be profiled as part of the group’s work. The Documents Project is at the forefront of digital initiatives in the field of modern Latin American art history, and it has tremendous potential for use in teaching, research, and collaboration among scholars across the Americas. The talk considers these different functions of the archive and reflects as well on its role in shaping the discipline at institutional, regional, national, and international levels.\n",

        "description": "> “Theses about the developmental tendencies of art under present conditions of production . . . brush aside a number of outmoded concepts, such as creativity and genius, eternal value and mystery. . .” – Walter Benjamin (1936)\n> “Do we claim to understand [Walter] Benjamin only now?” – Richard Shiff (2008)\nThe growing field of the digital humanities reflects the ever-broadening adoption by scholars of new electronic tools and the ongoing development of new opportunities for collaborative research and dissemination of their projects. What of digital curation? What implications does the growing presence of digital media art in the museum have for curators who seek both to care for and interpret these collections?\nWith a nod to Walter Benjamin’s recognition of the paradigmatic shift of the understanding of visual art and culture in the era of mass reproduction, this presentation will offer a curatorial perspective on the philosophic, aesthetic, and practical implications of collecting and exhibiting time-based and digital art at the Smithsonian and beyond. Based at the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery, I will address both how born digital time-based artwork reflects and shapes new ways of understanding the self and other, and the practical considerations associated with overseeing these new additions to our collection. How have these new works changed our practices and assumptions as scholars and caretakers? To this end, I will speak to the formation of the Smithsonian’s Time-Based and Digital Media Working Group and to the challenges and opportunities posed by new electronic media in the realm of the fine arts.\n",

        "description": "This talk will analyze reading and writing practices that are interactive, social, live, sited, and algorithmically produced. With examples ranging from installations, performances, interactive text events, and Second Life exhibits, Dr. Raley will consider a variety of expressive activities that are neither formalizable as “electronic literature” nor reducible to a stable and singular medium. How are scholars to engage textual practices that do not depend on inscriptional durability and thus do not entail the presence of an archive? The premise of her talk will be that ethnographic techniques, documentary recording, and formal analysis are in themselves methodologically insufficient if one wants to account for textual practices that do not have stable hermeneutic form. The overarching purpose will thus be to work toward developing a framework for understanding our mediatized textual environments and their intrinsic ephemerality, vernacularity, and disintegration.\nWorks discussed will include Ben Rubin and Mark Hansen, _Shakespeare Machine_; Sarah Waterson, Cristyn Davies, and Elena Cox, _Trope_; Jason Lewis and Obx Labs, _Cityspeak_; John Cayley and Daniel Howe, _The Readers Project_; Cayley, _imposition_; and some of Ted Warnell’s PbN (poems “by nari”).\n",

However web developers, designers and architects who attempt to put these ideas into practice soon find themselves not only learning a set of new technologies, but cast adrift in debates about web architecture, the semantic web, artificial intelligence and the nature of identity. In this talk I will briefly outline some of these historical debates, and attempt to characterize some pragmatic ways of realizing the goals of Linked Data with examples from the Web we have today.\n",

        "talk title": "Digitizing Chinese Englishmen",
        "description": "In this talk, Koh presents _Digitizing Chinese Englishmen_, a digital project that documents the creation of a group of “Asian Victorians” during the nineteenth century within the British Empire in Southeast Asia. While digital scholarship on the nineteenth century has proliferated in the past ten years, few projects that focus on the influence of Empire on Victorian culture currently exist. Digitizing Chinese Englishmen addresses this gap in an attempt to create a “postcolonial” digital archive in content and form: firstly, by digitizing _The Straits Chinese Magazine_, a nineteenth-century journal of Anglophone writing in Southeast Asia, and secondly, through features which allow site visitors to play a larger role in shaping the meanings of this archive via social media and their comments. In so doing, _Digitizing Chinese Englishmen_ attempts to address a larger debate on silences on race, class, gender and access within the digital humanities community through its recovery of overlooked texts, and by adopting an approach to display that is self-reflexive of the process of imperial knowledge creation within the digital archive. This talk documents the ways in which _Digitizing Chinese Englishmen_ undertakes this through describing certain scholarly gaps within the digital humanities community and Victorian studies, explaining how this project tries to address these gaps, and finally explaining some of the challenges involved in this recovery project.\n",

        "description": "How does one create a digital edition of a classical text, and what do we learn from it?\nThe Mishnah is in many ways a foundational text for contemporary Jews, and continues to be part of the curriculum of formal and informal study. A legal compendium of about 200 AD/CE , the Mishnah is also significant for understanding late-second-century Jews in Palestine. Yet no critical edition of the text exists. The Digital Mishnah Project aims to produce a born-digital edition that will take into account the full array of manuscript and other evidence, and automate the process of comparing variant readings and assessing the relationships between manuscripts.\nConceived as a tool rather than an edition, the Project will certainly make it easier for those who wish to track the text back to its earliest form to do so. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that its contribution to medieval book culture. As a tool, its design should draw on but also further develop the resources for other such editions, in any language.\nThe presentation will feature a demo, followed by a discussion of some of preliminary observations.\n",

        "description": "Cultural heritage collections represent important sources for scholars and enthusiasts, and offer ways for us to listen and learn from peoples and processes that are missing from documentary sources. Museum collections help to fill those gaps, but finding those types of collections and data online is challenging. With many students and scholars beginning their research with online search and discovery tools, if cultural heritage collections are not visible online, in some form, what are the implications of these absences? Do those objects and the stories that they help us to tell remain invisible? Increased online visibility of material culture from museums can increase the use of those objects by instructors, scholars, enthusiasts, and students. Once discovered, there is great potential for the museum to benefit from increased traffic, virtual and physical, and use of their collections which only helps the institution accomplish its mission. In the meantime, historians like me, look to other online collections, such as eBay for accessible online material culture.\nI will discuss my research into online history museum collections and some efforts that encourage getting to the stuff. I wish to engage the audience in answering two big questions: if these collections are online am I correct in assuming that researchers will use them? And, how can digital humanities scholars encourage and advocate for museums to open their collections for discovery and analysis from individuals outside of their institutions.\n",

        "description": "Ekphrasis—poetry to, for, and about the visual arts—provides rich territory for the exploration of literary tradition and genre definition. This talk will consider the challenges and opportunities presented when using topic modeling to consider issues of genre and discourse in ekphrastic poetry. Oriented toward the non-expert, conversation will assume no prior knowledge of topic modeling or social network analysis, but instead will provide a gentle introduction that builds toward an understanding of the potential uses for topic modeling and network analysis to explore large collections of poetic texts. Poetic collections, dense and rich with figurative language, require revising how we interpret topic modeling results, and this presentation will address how changes in interpretation affect the questions we might ask and the assumptions we can make about “topics” generated by latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)—one type of topic modeling algorithm.\nFurthermore, this talk will demonstrate how the story of ekphrasis, a genre of poetry in which contributions by women are often seen as “in addition to” or “outside” of it, changes when we break open the binding of the canon and include poems by women as central to its tradition. The computational strengths afforded by LDA help reorganize critical thinking about ekphrasis as a complex distribution of discourses, and this talk will demonstrate a few possible ways to refocus the aperture of the critical lens to ask enduring humanities questions about visual-verbal relationships from new perspectives.\n",

        "description": "What do you get when you cross archives and artifacts with timelines, modern and historical maps, and an appreciation for the interpretive aims of humanities scholarship?\nNeatline is suite of tools for the creation of beautiful, complex, hand-crafted maps and narrative sequences from collections of documents and objects: [neatline.org](http://neatline.org/). It also allows users to connect interpretive maps and interlinked texts with timelines that are more-than-usually sensitive to ambiguity and nuance. Interactive stories designed in Neatline become a scholar’s, student’s, or curator’s interpretive expression of a given archival or cultural heritage collection — and multiple interpretations can be layered over a single collection. In other words, Neatline exhibits are contributions to humanities scholarship, in the visual vernacular.\nWith the support of the National Endowment for the Humanties and the Library of Congress, the Scholars’ Lab at UVa Library designed Neatline as a set of plugins for Omeka, which provides a powerful, open-source platform for content management and web publication. This allowed the Neatline team to concentrate on conceptual and aesthetic aspects of geo-temporal exhibit-building. Project director Bethany Nowviskie will frame a discussion of opportunities for Neatline-based scholarship in terms of problems of scale: the decision to focus on “hand-crafted visualization” and “small data” (rather than on large-scale, algorithmic placement of information on maps and timelines); and the shift in software development plans from the creation of a stand-alone tool to a modular approach. Lead developer David McClure will share exhibits he has developed and offer a demo.\n",

The emphasis is on productive, collegial work or free-form discussion.\n- Spontaneous and timely: The agenda / schedule / program being mostly or entirely created by all the participants during the first session of the first day, rather than weeks or months beforehand by a program committee.\n- Non-hierarchical: THATCamps welcome graduate students, scholars, librarians, archivists, museum professionals, developers and programmers, K-12 teachers, administrators, managers, and funders as well as people from the non-profit sector, people from the for-profit sector, and interested amateurs. The topic “the humanities and technology” contains multitudes.\n- Productive: Participants are encouraged to use session time to create, build, write, hack, and solve problems.\nTHATCamp Coordinator Amanda French will discuss the THATCamp phenomenon’s implications for the digital humanities as well answer practical questions about running one of your own.\n",

        "talk title": "Archaeology and the Big Tent of the Digital Humanities",
        "description": "Recently, there has been much discussion about “the big tent” as a metaphor to define and delineate the boundaries of the Digital Humanities. This metaphor has invariably led to debate as to who is in this “tent,” and who is not – essentially, who is a member of the digital humanities community (or who is a digital humanist), and who is not.\nCuriously, archaeology (especially anthropological archaeology) is largely absent from this discussion. Archeologists rarely publish in the same places as digital humanists. For the most part, archaeologists do not seek funding from the same agencies (and programs) that digital humanists commonly turn to. It is also rare to see archaeologists at digital humanities conferences (or unconferences). In fact, many in the archaeological community aren’t even aware that the digital humanities exist. To extend the metaphor, they are so far from the tent, they can’t even see it.\nThis state of affairs is puzzling. Archaeology clearly articulates nicely with many of the fields that identify as being part of DH. Archaeologists have also long been invested in a wide variety of innovative digital technologies and practices. Ultimately, this odd separation represents an enormous missed opportunity, as the communities clearly have a great deal to offer one another.\nIt’s within this context that this talk will explore the reasons for this separation. More importantly, however, it will propose some key points of commonality between the digital humanities and archaeology in an attempt to suggest pathways to fruitful engagement, interaction, and collaboration.\n",

        "description": "The advent of digital modes of representation has been changing humanistic practices for three decades, most recently in the emergence of a new cohort of scholars identifying themselves as “digital humanists,” while simultaneously problematizing the term. I will suggest a framework for thinking about these disciplinary and methodological confusions, by looking upon everything made of bits as part of a new medium with still emerging genres, and asking what role the humanities have to play in the collective effort to invent that medium, and, conversely, how that process of media invention is provoking a radical re-examination of humanistic practices. Can we see the current moment as a significant turn in the humanities toward an embrace of the power of representation, as a result of the new representational power that has come into our hands? As an illustration of an unconflicted approach to digital humanism I will briefly show some recent projects of my group and connect them to the collective project of inventing new narrative conventions in order to capture and share more complex understanding of the world.\n",

        "description": "Public libraries have a long tradition of serving as a knowledge base for their communities and for the nation as a whole. The change flowing from the information revolution puts this role at risk as libraries face new demands to justify their budgets.\nI will talk about how public libraries have the opportunity to assert relevancy by promoting digital archiving. Libraries are well-situated to form digital collections that document the history and current activities of their communities. This data will support student and other research projects, including work in the digital humanities. As well, the collections will serve as a resource for building community identity and cohesion. These are considerations that local citizens and their governments can readily appreciate.\nI also will discuss how, in developing local collections, libraries can fill a civic and cultural purpose in helping people with personal digital archiving needs. Many people and their families are amassing large collections of digital photographs, email and other personal content. They have little, if any, knowledge about the issues involved in preserving their personal archives. Raising public awareness is also critical to extend the practical reality of digital preservation overall. Most preserving institutions depend on community support, and sustaining digital preservation at scale depends on regular people appreciating the value of the work. Working at the grassroots, libraries can help people appreciate the cultural importance of digital preservation, as well as the critical role that cultural heritage institutions have to play.\n",

        "talk title": "Small TEI Projects on a Large Scale: TAPAS",
        "description": "The TEI Archiving, Publishing, and Access Service (TAPAS) is tackling one of the trickiest problems of scholarly text encoding. How can we provide robust, large-scale TEI publication services, while accommodating the detailed scholarly insight that makes TEI such a valuable tool for the digital humanities? What level of customization and variation can we support without compromising on interoperability, and what are the mechanisms by which we can achieve the optimal balance? And who needs variation anyway—what kinds of scholarly insight are at stake, or at risk?\nTAPAS seeks to offer long-term TEI repository and publishing services, with special focus on supporting scholars who lack access to XML publishing infrastructure or expertise at their own institutions. Supported by a planning grant from the IMLS and now by a two-year IMLS National Leadership Grant and an NEH Digital Humanities Startup Grant, the TAPAS service will make it possible for scholars to use TEI in their teaching and research without mastering the full suite of XML technologies. The service will also provide access to consulting, training, documentation, and community-developed tools. This talk will explore the conceptual and strategic challenges in developing TAPAS, and in particular the problem of how to harmonize—or transcend—divergent approaches to TEI encoding.\n",

Recent work explores novel and engaging ways to visualize and explore cultural heritage data collections and tell little stories with big data. See demos of applications built on Microsoft PixelSense and Surfaces that demonstrate the architecture of intimacy and public interactives. These range from digital memorials to multitouch interaction to explore large-format artworks in their rich context of related artworks, annotations, and guided tours. We will also explore the technological and social challenges of creating interactive exhibits around the AIDS Memorial Quilt, the largest community-created piece of folk art in the world. These applications are a beachhead on the untouched shores of big humanities research. They are what we can expect today and are also first steps towards what might define an ideal user interface.\n",

        "description": "Archival description is a cornerstone of the practice of archivy, and in most cases is the initial interface between an archival institution’s holdings and the audience for those holdings. While many authors within the archival profession have written both practical and theoretical articles on archival description, there is relatively little within the professional literature that provides a conceptual framework or formalization of archival description. When these frameworks or formalizations do exist, they are seldom interconnected to the critical trend in archivistics which has developed within the last twenty-five years. These two intellectual strands investigating the larger context of archives and archival description have the potential to inform each other and become highly intertwined. This presentation will discuss the meaning, structure, and use of archival description from a variety of perspectives. We will define archival description both abstractly and in terms of its constituent components and the relationships between those components. We will also determine what archival description intends to express and convey to the variety of its audiences, as well as its intended purpose from the perspective of the archivist. With these definitions in place, we will then investigate the strengths and limitations provided by these definitions. In particular, we will analyze the constraints that current archival metadata standards place on the transformative power of archival description. Finally, we will explore possibilities for reconceptualizing the structure and model for representations of archival entities that can leverage pluralistic recontextualization as well as emerging methods for sharing and relating information, such as the Linked Data paradigm.\n",

        "description": "I’ve spent my MITH fellowship year working on “The Black Gotham Digital Archive.” My goal is to link an interactive web site, smart phones, and the geographic spaces of Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn to create a deeper understanding of nineteenth-century black New York. The project is an extension of my book, _Black Gotham: A Family History of African Americans in Nineteenth-Century New York City _(Yale UP, 2011), and is motivated by my search for new media forms that will allow greater flexibility, interactivity, and potential for reaching a broader audience.\nI structured my book around two principal concepts. The first was chronology, in which I took family history as a starting point to construct a broader social and cultural history of New York City’s black elite from about 1805 to 1895. The second was social geography, in which I illustrated the myriad ways in which members of the black elite inhabited Gotham, emphasizing how, in contrast to the all too familiar Harlem model, nineteenth-century black New Yorkers lived throughout the entire city, in different wards and neighborhoods.\nMy digital archive is structured around the same conceptual principles, but it relies on a different form of storytelling, one which inverts the relationship between text and image. In my book, word was the primary vehicle for telling my story and image functioned as supporting illustration; in the digital archive, image is the primary vehicle and word supporting document. Throughout the year, I’ve been working with MITH staff member Seth Denbo to implement this storytelling principle. Using Omeka as a platform, we have created a series of exhibits based on images, maps with clickable icons, narrative and descriptive text with links to ancillary material (manuscript material, newspaper accounts, books, collections, etc). The result is a greater sense of simultaneity (different historical actors doing different things at same time), mobility (movement through the streets of New York), and audience interactivity.\nIn the next phase of my project, I encourage further interactivity in at least two ways. The first is the creation of smart phone walking tours that will enable visitors to my archive to download an app that uses real-time geo-location information to provide them with targeted content from it; they can visit the neighborhoods discussed in the archive, view the locations of places mentioned, see images in context, and read the information provided. The second is to create a feature that will allow viewers to add their own stories to “The Black Gotham Digital Archive” and thus enhance our knowledge base of the social and cultural history of black New Yorkers in the nineteenth century.\n",

        "description": "I will discuss the Libraries of Early America project, an effort to digitize and make widely available the library collections of American readers from the early colonial period through 1825. Using the online book-cataloging site LibraryThing.com, scholars and volunteers from institutions around the country – including Monticello, the Boston Public Library, the Massachusetts Historical Society, the Boston Athenaeum, the American Antiquarian Society and others – have begun the process of creating an extensive online database of early American libraries. Current subjects include Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Lady Jean Skipwith, James and Mary Murray, and other early American readers (some well-known, others obscure).\nUnlike standalone institutional databases or online library catalogs, the Libraries of Early America collections through LibraryThing allow users to quickly and easily make comparisons between libraries (what books did John Adams and Benjamin Franklin have in common, for example, or what books were most commonly shared among all the Signers of the Declaration of Independence?), and to search collections which may not exist today in physical form or which are spread across multiple institutions and private collections. A reconstruction of the multi-generational Mather Family library makes those titles widely available for the first time. Further, LibraryThing’s capabilities allow significant data about each book to be added to the record where known: transcriptions of marginalia, information about acquisition of the title, the binding, correspondence about a given book, or even a link to a digital scan of the volumes (as with the John Adams collection at the Boston Public Library).\nSo far, data on more than 1,250 early American libraries has been added, with more information constantly being collected and included. I’ll discuss the origins of the project, sources and methods, and future plans and enhancements.\n",

        "description": "Imagine you need to get the gist of what’s going on in a large text dataset such as all tweets that mention Obama, all e-mails sent within a company, or all newspaper articles published by _The New York Times_ in the 1990s. Topic models, which automatically discover the themes which permeate a corpus, are a popular tool for discovering what’s being discussed. However, topic models aren’t perfect; errors hamper adoption of the model, performance in downstream computational tasks, and human understanding of the data. However, humans can easily diagnose and fix these errors. We present a statistically sound model to incorporate hints and suggestions from humans to iteratively refine topic models to better model large datasets.\nWe also examine how topic models can be used to understand topic control in debates and discussions. We demonstrate a technique that can identify when speakers are “controlling” the topic of a conversation, which can identify events such as when participants in a debate don’t answer a question, when pundits steer a conversation toward talking points, or when a moderator exerts her influence on a discourse.\n",

        "description": "This talk will take an informal look at interactive visualization projects done at the University of Virginia’s [Virginia Center for Digital History (VCDH)](http://www.vcdh.virginia.edu/index.php?page=VCDH) and the [Sciences, Arts, & Humanities Network of Technology Initiatives (SHANTI)](http://shanti.virginia.edu/) digital humanities centers. The projects were built using an NEH-funded visualization authoring tool, [VisualEyes](http://www.viseyes.org/), developed at UVa.[VisualEyes](http://www.viseyes.org/) enables scholars to present selected primary source materials and research findings while encouraging active inquiry and hands-on learning among general and targeted audiences. It communicates through the use of dynamic displays that organize and present meaningful information in both traditional and multimedia formats, such as audio-video, animation, charts, maps, data, and interactive timelines.\nI will also show a number of student-generated visualizations, created in the context of undergraduate project-based learning (PBL) seminars, and discuss how visualization and PBL are strong partners to promote historical inquiry. As a consequence, I have developed a new model to help scaffold the design of data-driven interactive projects called ASSERT. _Ask_ a question; _Search_ for evidence to answer that question; _Structure_ the data; _Envision_ ways to answer the question using the structured data; _Represent_ that data in a compelling interactive manner; and finally, _Tell_ a story using that data to answer the question.\n",

        "description": "Digital Humanities research has found increased funding and job opportunities, and it has become a center piece of efforts to raise the rankings and profile of universities seeking the highest Carnegie Research status. It also has a blossoming industry that includes “text analytics” widely used in national security studies.\nThat type of DH research usually means digitizing massive amounts of texts, constructing databases, organizing information, and representing the patterns into meaningful conclusions. The researchers mine data in texts to make existing texts more accessible, and to discover connections and patterns difficult to decipher without computing power and information design.In the midst of building a databases for two digital humanities project, Dr. Craig Saper realized that the interfaces his team had constructed online had a more profound impact on how one read the texts than the use of the database alone.\nThe online interface changed how one read — even changed the essence of what one read. The futures of reading using new devices, like e-readers, will have consequences for the definition and practice of what we call reading.\nSaper’s presentation for MITH’s Digital Dialogues will look at four of his major digital humanities projects – two online and two just starting – on r\\e\\a\\d/i/n/g/ as a publishing practice and potential strategic alliances among the campuses on the university of Maryland system. \n",

        "talk title": "A Conversation about Compulsion, the World’s Columbian Exposition of 1893, and Virtual Reality",
        "description": "Is there a place for virtual reality in the digital humanities toolkit? For all of the early hype surrounding the use virtual reality for teaching and learning and the ubiquity of online options for exploring three-dimensional worlds, the challenges inherent in developing and sustaining large-scale academic reconstruction projects limit their viability and likelihood for success.\nAcademics considering such foolishness must contend with disciplinary skepticism, the need to articulate appropriate research questions to justify the effort required to produce tangible results, and pressure to develop methodologies for annotations and citations that are comparable to print publications. From a project management perspective, three-dimensional research is difficult because it requires a specific start-up environment, ongoing funding beyond that typically available to the humanities researcher, and a clearly defined ultimate use for the eventual product that justifies the expended effort. From a curricular perspective, virtual reality research exists only on the borders of digital humanities as it is currently defined. In order to fully integrate three-dimensional research into the curriculum, administrators need to contend with issues of scalability, the availability of software, a need for clearly defined learning objectives, and a steep learning curve that can negatively impact student projects.\nWorking from the conviction that virtual reality – even given these daunting challenges – does provide significant research opportunities for academics and benefits to student users, this presentation will focus on the reconstruction projects that are the hallmark of three-dimensional research at UCLA. Following a demonstration of the World’s Columbian Exposition project currently under construction, Snyder will discuss her project team’s efforts to leverage existing and new computer modeling work for pedagogical use through a new NEH-funded real-time software interface and content repository intended to provide a mechanism for exploring highly detailed three-dimensional models in educational settings.\n",

        "description": "Lynn Cazabon is a visual artist whose work poses questions about human progress by focusing on what gets left behind in its wake. Cazabon will discuss her project _Discard_, which consists of several discrete series of large-scale photographic prints featuring movie films discarded by public institutions (libraries, schools, archives). Harking back to the 19th century practice of postmortem photography, each print in this body of work serves as a memento mori to the recently obsolete medium of film. In its totality, _Discard_ is a shadow archive, reflecting that which has been omitted from institutional archives and reflecting upon a process by which values are reversed: whereby something once valued becomes worthless and looses its viability as a cultural artifact. The project also underlines our current reliance on potentially unstable digital technologies to preserve the things we deem to be worth saving and asks what is lost when we don’t save such physical artifacts (like film) but only transfer its image to digital media. Cazabon will also discuss the notion of the archive as it plays out in her other projects.\n\n_We regret that the audio is not available for Lynn Cazabon's digital dialogue. However, video and slides are available for viewing._\n",

        "description": "The [Visual Accent Dialect Archive (VADA)](http://visualaccentdialectarchive.com/) was created as a central resource for performers seeking authentic dialects and accents of the English language in which they could see the speakers as well as hear them. The gestural characteristics of the speakers from different regions, while unique to the speaker, are also unique to the culture of the region and help the researcher to acquire the sounds intrinsic to that dialect or accent by the formation of the lips and use of the vocal and articulatory musculature. As a crowd-sourced website, or \"wiki\", the Visual Accent Dialect Archive has the potential to attract dialect and accent donations from all over the world. Donors may speak a story, or a list of words, or a paragraph. Once the VADA website is populated, researchers can click on a specific region, country, or state and locate the specific dialect or accent. In addition to being a central resource for performers, the website provides excellent cultural information for anthropologists and linguists.\n",

But, while Wikipedia was born online, many of the ideas that inform its composition have long histories. Human beings have strived to give order to knowledge in the face of worries about information overload for ages. Their various responses have been shaped by the cultural norms, social needs, and technological possibilities of their historical contexts. This talk will focus on the old media precedents for Wikipedia’s new media success story to explore what reciprocal relationships they reveal between concepts like knowledge and information and the technologies we design to build and distribute them.\n",

        "description": "[ The Arcane Gallery of Gadgetry (AGOG)](http://www.arcanegalleryofgadgetry.org/) is a sort of narrative [wunderkammer](http://jeresmith.com/portfolio/objects/object-wunderkammer.jpg) of an alternate reality game (ARG), a “cabinet of curiosities” combining a rich and oftentimes mysteriously fragmented historical tapestry with what Rob MacDougall has called “playful historical thinking.” By incorporating [counterfactuals](http://www.colitz.com/site/0906/0906_view.html) and re-imagining the past, AGOG is designed to lead players into a newly enfranchised relationship with history, teach them [STEM](http://www.colitz.com/site/0901/0901_view.html) and information literacy skills, and help them discover the secret stories outside most history books. In the first full-fledged season of the game, middle school players raced against time to gain cryptographic, [archival](http://colitz.com/site/556248/556248.htm), cartographic, and inventor skills that would help them prevent a dangerous rift in the course of history. In today’s talk, attendees will also take part in an activity. With each season of the ARG based around a different intriguing lost invention from the Arcane Gallery of Gadgetry, there’s always a new story to uncover, a new rabbit hole to fall down–and it’s never too late to change the past!\nThe AGOG ARG was part of “ARGs in the Service of Design and Education,” an NSF-funded study of the design process and [educational](http://www.colitz.com/site/1003/1003.html) use of ARGs. The purpose of the ongoing research around the ARG is to better understand how transmedia storytelling experiences can be used as novel educational activities and how experts and novices create transmedia experiences and experience them. The AGOG team includes Kari Kraus (iSchool/English Dept.), Beth Bonsignore (iSchool), and Amanda Visconti (English Dept.) at UMD, Derek Hansen at BYU, and Ann Fraistat.

        "description": "In a world of pervasive media and ubiquitous computing, this talk asks what happens as everything (objects, subjects, and actions) moves toward animation across a network. How does media and mediation affect our sense of agency? I use the example of A Scanner Darkly (dir. Linklater 2006) to discuss the effects of pervasive media and how it affects the parameters of self-reflection and agency. I look at issues surrounding mediated presence (copresence) and the threat to face-to-face engagement that pervasive media implies. The question I ask is: if as a society we are subjected to a pervasive mediation, how may we imagine modes of agency within an animated world?\n",

        "description": "The vanishing physical book provides a set of discovery, marketing and publicity (and not a few existential) challenges to trade publishers. As the book transitions from physical object to a licensed file cohabitating with other forms of media on an electronic device, we need to unpack the sense of permanence and cultural heft inherent in the physical form and figure out what exactly makes a book a book.\nI do not come to wallow in nostalgia nor lament the rise of ebooks, but to participate in a discussion about how the publishing industry (which has seen many technological disruptions to its business model) moves forward. Because books matter.\n### About W.W. Norton\n[W. W. Norton & Company](http://books.wwnorton.com/books/), the oldest and largest publishing house owned wholly by its employees, strives to carry out the imperative of its founder to “publish books not for a single season, but for the years” in fiction, nonfiction, poetry, college textbooks, cookbooks, art books and professional books.\n",

        "talk title": "Learning on the Job",
        "description": "The research environment within which professional humanists and librarians have been accustomed to working is being reshaped by both internal and external pressures. In different ways, scholars’ debates about publishing, tenure and promotion systems, libraries’ straining budgets and physical spaces, and funding agencies’ new mandates require that all these communities engage with basic research on and professional practice of data curation in order to fulfill their missions. In the sciences, the expectation that data supporting published research will be available for review and re-use is becoming more common and any fundamental reform of peer review in the humanities would hopefully encompass a similar position on the relationship between data and publications. Moreover, the acceptance of digital projects as scholarship depends on the data for these projects continuing to remain available. In an era of abundant, networked information, a crucial part of the value proposition of libraries will depend on their ability to steward unique local resources and invent new services to meet the evolving needs of students and research faculty. Funding agencies have begun to mandate data management plans in order to protect their investment of public funds in research but these agencies will need advice from the scholarly community and libraries to refine and fully operationalize these mandates.\nFor humanists, librarians, and the public, which remains deeply invested in the subjects and materials of the humanities, data curation is not a passing fad or a temporary innovation; data curation is an important part of the solution to many key challenges in the conduct and support of innovative research in the humanities. This talk will explore how humanists, librarians, and members of the wider public might all learn “on the job”, as it were, to participate in the curation of data through changes to core courses in humanists’ professional training, through inflecting numerous existing positions throughout libraries with a new data curation focus, and through open sharing of tools, strategies and best practices in a manner that acknowledges the opportunities for peer-to-peer training.\n",

        "description": "Macrosolutions are shared global services that provide institutions with resources and solutions that have the opportunity to take advantage of networked enterprise-class scale. These types of services, which were once only locally provided, can now be distributed among institutions for a peer-sourced type of community support. By investing in a shared networked solution, academic libraries can achieve efficiencies and market influence, that would be impossible at the scale of any one institution. In order to realize the promise of networked macrosolutions, libraries must be able to externalize their service need and trust their peer counterparts to help provide services that were once traditionally a single source operation.\nA key factor for success is in directly engaging with faculty and academic officers to communicate a compelling strategy in which selective externalization of services can be win-win situation for the local institution as well as for the external partners. Traditional library functions improve the libraries’ ability to fulfill a local contextual academic and research mission. However, creating new avenues for networked global scale shared services can be in the best interest of all parties. For some shared services, managing them at the largest scale offers savings both in terms of that particular service as well as in terms of capital re-investment in other more locally contextually dependent services. Externalizing functions is not new – but doing so in a highly networked environment, at global-scale is. The [HathiTrust Digital Library](http://www.hathitrust.org/) and the [Digital Public Library of America](http://dp.la/) will be discussed as examples of macrosolutions and how they have the potential to change how libraries engage with scholars.\n",

        "talk title": "Criticism in the Digital Humanities",
        "description": "As the digital humanities community expands beyond its computing roots, and as humanistic inquiry and interpretation (as opposed to methodological novelty) feature more prominently in its projects, the boundaries between digital and analog humanities grow increasingly blurred and permeable. One fortunate result is that more DH work has been opened up to scholarly critique by a considerably broader humanities audience. However, much of this work — often the most innovative —­ cannot be fully evaluated through the traditional critical lenses of the humanities.\nThis talk argues that the DH community neither has established a sufficient rubric for critiquing its work, nor has been critical enough of its own projects. It argues, too, that DH work does require special consideration that is not part of typical humanities criticism, and without it, calls its own value into question. So what constitutes a scholarly DH project? How many critical rubrics might be needed to accommodate the variety of valuable projects? Can the diversifying DH community ever agree on these? This talk grapples with a critical theory for the digital humanities with hopes of fostering a much longer conversation about how humanities scholars can appreciate and fruitfully critique the variety of digital work that is reshaping the humanities.\nDr. Gibb’s talk will be held in the MITH Conference Room, in the basement of McKeldin Library.\nYou can read Gibbs' blog post follow-up to his Digital Dialogue [here](http://historyproef.org/blog/digital-humanities/critical-discourse-in-the-digital-humanities/).\n",

        "description": "To tackle increasingly large digitized archives of text, the digital humanities community has responded with an avid interest in text mining and visualization. Everywhere one looks these days, computer scientists are bringing text analysis to humanities scholars with tutorials, workshops, and toolkits. Nevertheless, crucial information is being lost in translation. If text analysis toolkits are to be truly successful, information needs to start flowing the other way and computer scientists must learn from humanities scholars what humanistic text analysis really means. If not, they will continue making \"natural\" assumptions that do not always translate into the humanities. For example, concepts like \"question\", \"hypothesis\", \"data\", \"evidence\" are always well-defined in scholars' minds and are universal to all analysis. In the extreme case, this misalignment of basic assumptions could lead to fleets of powerful text analysis tools that nobody knows how to actually apply to humanistic analysis. In this talk, Aditi Muralidharan, Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science at UC Berkeley, will describe her experiences collaborating with English scholars to build the NEH-funded WordSeer text analysis toolkit, and discuss differences between the ways that computer scientists and humanities scholars view text analysis, and ways in which communication between the two fields can be improved.\n",

These questions, among others, are asked by SIVA VAIDHYANATHAN, Professor of Media Studies at the University of Virginia, in his recently published tome _The Googlization of Everything — and Why We Should Worry_. Using Google Street View as the prime example and case study, Dr. Vaidhyanathan explores the ways and means through which Google engineers and justifies its systems of surveillance around the world. Despite proclaiming cultural sensitivity, Google engages in a “one-size-fits-all” model of privacy — and the defaults are always set to Google’s advantage. \nIn addition to discussing his book, Dr. Vaidhyanathan will introduce the notion of “infrastructural imperialism” to describe how Google goes about managing its relations with users and states around the world.\n\n",

        "talk title": "Diggable Data, Scalable Reading, and New Humanities Scholarship",
        "description": "In his 2005 book, Franco Moretti aims to open “a new front of discussion” by calling for a “distant reading” of texts in the pursuit of literary history. Abstraction in the form of the _Graphs, Maps and Trees _of the book’s title, he argues, reduces the number of elements in focus, providing a “sharper sense of their overall interconnection.” Moretti’s call is being been taken up by scholars working in a digital milieu, though not without controversy.\nWith mass digitization of print culture the potential for new types of investigation into the human condition is enormous, but just as scholars have always required a network of libraries and archives to support their use of books, manuscripts and other textual resources, digital resources require an infrastructure for discovery, study, and maintenance. Partnerships between research libraries, IT departments, and digital humanities centers have developed to support digitally enhanced scholarship in the arts and humanities. Internationally, in recent years several large-scale projects have been funded within the humanities and social sciences, to provide infrastructure to support the new digital scholarship. The University of Maryland is currently partnering with 9 other universities on one such international effort: the Mellon-funded [Project Bamboo](http://www.projectbamboo.org/), which is attempting to answer the question: “How can we advance arts and humanities research through the development of shared technology services?”\nIn this presentation and the ensuing discussion, we aim to present and contextualize our work on Project Bamboo in light of new modes of humanities digital scholarship and reading, including text mining and corpora analysis. Utilizing the high profile [Google Books Ngram Viewer](http://ngrams.googlelabs.com/) project and reactions to the “[culturomics](http://www.culturomics.org/)” approach as examples of the benefits and pitfalls of textual analysis at scale, we will argue for a scalable approach to humanities research, simultaneously distant and close, where for each step of abstraction away, the scholar can step back into the detail of the text.\n",

        "description": "Many popular natural language processing techniques and tools rely on annotated training corpora to learn models that can be used to process new data from a similar domain. We can train a parser on Wall Street Journal text from the Penn Treebank, for example, and expect it to perform reasonably well on recent blog posts or movie reviews, but not necessarily on eighteenth-century conduct manuals. Unfortunately it's often hard to find or create appropriate training data for specific literary genres or historical periods, even in English. In this talk Travis Brown, Assistant Director of Research and Development at MITH, will look at some examples of semi-supervised and unsupervised methods that can be used to explore large text collections in domains with little or no available training data.\n",

The irony is that explicit training in the professional tools employed by professors, would actually make PhDs who end up off the tenure track, more widely employable. This presentation is intended to open up a discussion to identify professional tools that will make PhDs better professors, better alt-ac employees, and create better paths to non-academic careers. All we have to do is shake the fantasy that scholarship alone will save us, that everything practical can be absorbed through osmosis, that even admitting contingency is tantamount to failure. It's time to get real about who we are and what we do.\n",

        "description": "Digital cultural heritage collections include temporal, locative, and categorical data which are increasingly enabling new interfaces to our cultural heritage. These kinds of dynamic interfaces are what end users are starting to expect of their interactions. Trevor Owens, digital archivist at the National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program (NDIIPP) in the Office of Strategic Initiatives at the Library of Congress and a doctoral student in the Graduate School of Education at George Mason University,  will open a discussion of the way these kinds of interfaces change the way curators, librarians, archivists, researchers and general public see materials in these collections. To ground this discussion in a concrete example, the presentation will focus on one NDIIPP project, Recollection. Recollection is a free platform built by Zepheira LLC for the Library of Congress which empowers historians, librarians, archivists and curators to create and customize views, (interactive maps, timelines, facets, tag clouds) of digital collections. The demonstration will show how the software can import collections from spreadsheets or MODS records, augment and transform that data online, generate distinct interactive visual interfaces, and ultimately copy-paste to embed the interfaces they design in any webpage. The discussion of this specific tool will serve as a place to ground a broader general discussion of the possibilities and implications of these kinds of dynamic interfaces to collections.\n",

        "talk title": "Representing Lively Bodies in Sound: Legacies of Analog Signification in Digital Audio",
        "description": "How did it become commonplace for creative practitioners and engineers in contemporary audio cultures to think of sounds as individual entities, with distinct aesthetic properties that can be technologically controlled? This talk will address this metaphor of electronic sounds as individuals, which is such a familiar concept in epistemologies of digital audio that it has escaped critical attention. This metaphor took shape over the nineteenth century in tandem with the development of graphical methods that represented diverse phenomena in a common language of waveforms. Notions of sonic individuation and variability also emerged in the contexts of Darwinian thought, and a cultural fascination with electricity as a kind of animating force. Tara Rodgers argues that practices of classifying individual sounds by aesthetic variations are deeply entwined with epistemologies of gender and racial difference in Western philosophy and modern science, and that these legacies persist in contemporary representations of digital audio. This talk will also introduce some of her recent sound and music projects that complement this research by engaging metaphor as a creative tool.\n",

        "description": "At the dawn of the era of home computing, an unusual type of game was the most popular to play. With just a screen of text and a prompt, you would be asked the simple question: What do you want to do next? As you typed in commands and sentences, the games would tell you a story a story fraught with danger, excitement, puzzles and hours of exploration. They were called text adventures, adventure games, and interactive fiction. They dominated the sales charts and introduced millions to the power and flexibility of home computers. No other type of computer game could come close. And then they were gone forever. Or maybe they never actually left. Director Jason Scott interviewed dozens of creators, players, and scholars about the experience and effect of text adventures and interactive fiction. The result is _Get Lamp_, a documentary with multiple paths that takes you from a cave deep in Kentucky to the arrival of what some think is a brand new form of literature. What do you want to do next? (Trailer for [GET LAMP](http://www.getlamp.com/)).\n",

Using the CUNY Academic Commons – a site created by and for faculty members, graduate students, and administrators from the 23 campuses of the City University of New York – as a case study, Professor Gold will discuss the emergence of a new generation of university-sponsored virtual spaces that foreground social interaction as they attempt to foster collaborative research communities.  Though not without complications, such spaces afford an alternate view of the intellectual life of the university, one that has the potential to offer a more engaging vision of academic life at a time when the humanities in particular, and universities more generally, are being asked to demonstrate their value to the wider public.\n",

After undergoing six months of interrogations and nine consecutive lie-detector tests, he was cleared of suspicions. After this harrowing experience, Elahi conceived \"[Tracking Transience](http://trackingtransience.net)\", a self-tracking system that constantly and publicly presents his exact location, activities, and other personal data. This self-surveillance project is a critique of contemporary investigative techniques and provides an ongoing \"alibi\" for Elahi in the event of future accusations.\n",

        "description": "This semester, the Computer Science Department and the English Department at UMD teamed up to provide Honors students in Book 2.0: The History of the Book and the Future of Reading with a prototype electronic reading device. The deployment is part of a longitudinal study to understand how electronic reading devices are used in an academic setting. One of the goals this semester is also to determine how the introduction of a second device---wirelessly linked to the first---affects the reading experience. In this Digital Dialogues talk, Chen will describe the devices being used by Kraus and her students, their design rationale, and some of the more unique aspects of the study being conducted. Kraus will preview an upcoming assignment that has students reading a 20th-century avant-garde novel on the dual-display e-readers, a novel originally published in unbound sheaves that the reader is encouraged to assemble in any order. The presenters will conclude with some of the more surprising results gathered so far, at the halfway point of this study.\n",

        "description": "Today's mobile devices are natively equipped with multimedia means for families to capture and share their daily experiences. However, designing authoring tools that effectively integrate the discrete media-capture components of mobile devices to enable rich expression remains a challenge. This presentation will provide a brief overview of collaborative technologies that support children's storytelling, with a focus on mobile applications. It will detail a 4-month study on the observed use of StoryKit, a mobile interface that integrates multimodal media-capture tools to support the creation of multimedia stories on an iPhone/iPod Touch. The primary objectives of the study were to explore the ways in which applications like StoryKit enable families to create and share stories; and to investigate how the created stories themselves might inform the design of, and learning potential for mobile storytelling applications. Its results suggest that StoryKit's relatively simple but well-integrated interface enables the creation of vibrant, varied narratives. Further, its portability supported the complementary co-construction and spontaneous, playful capture of stories by children and their trusted adults.\n",

        "talk title": "Archiving America: The Vitaphone, the DVD, and Warner Bros. (re)Store Jazz History ",
        "description": "In 2007 Warner Bros. released the 80th anniversary DVD edition of _The Jazz Singer_, a boxed set that includes 34 conversion-era sound shorts and a 90-minute documentary about the Vitaphone and the birth of sound cinema. This collection is a tempered version of Warner's prior histories of the conversion that situate the studio squarely at the lead in what its executives unflinchingly labeled a \"revolution\" of the motion picture industry. While Warner Bros. explicitly appeals for a revision of its former hubris, the jazz shorts included in this volume not only support the studio's prior nomination of Al Jolson as the leader of American jazz, they characterize American music history as a hodgepodge of white performances lacking a dominant trend and calling for a star. In this collection as in many of its other DVD releases, Warner Bros. recreates the film experience by including contemporary shorts that might plausibly (and in some cases would certainly) have been screened alongside the feature for which the disc was conceived. An attempt at historical accuracy, this practice instead constructs a spectator capable only of browsing the past for clues to what both he and the studio already know to be true. This presentation considers the practice of archiving American jazz for both the period of conversion and the present reconstruction of the era and argues that the potential for innovation enabled by digital remastering is complicated by Warner's continued efforts to shape the reception of its historiography.\n",

On the one hand, we are beginning to see new possibilities for research that were not feasible with the tools of print culture. At the same time, and perhaps even more importantly, we are seeing a reorganization of who can participate and what they can contribute. We can see the possibility of a truly global field emerging, with implications far beyond the traditional bounds of classical studies.\n",

But what kind of electronic books and electronic reading devices do we really want? Are we trying to improve on the book, or create something new? Something different? Are there some universal design principles we can agree on? And what about the bigger picture: can electronic gadgetry reverse the national decline in reading dramatically documented by agencies such as the NEA? This roundtable discussion led by Ben Bederson, Nick Chen, and Matt Kirschenbaum will feature as many electronic reading and electronic book devices as we can lay our hands on, including some prototypes being developed here at the University of Maryland. We'll hold them up, pass them around, turn them on, talk some trash, and, in the process, maybe gain just a little bit of insight into what we all want from our electronic book readers. Attendees are encouraged to bring along electronic book devices of their own.\n",

Professor Sample argues the ideal result is the open source professor, a teacher and scholar who applies the tenets of the open source software community to his or her own professional life. This means sharing, conversation, collaboration, and reflection at every step in the teaching and research process, not just with the final product. Technology plays a key role in making open source professing possible, and Professor Sample will discuss the philosophical and practical implications of such a transparent approach to pedagogy and scholarship, as well as possible pitfalls for untenured faculty.\n",

        "description": "One of the most exciting and potentially transformative aspects of digital humanities is an inflection from dealing with scarcity to dealing with abundance. Traditionally, humanities libraries have been defined by their emphasis on rare materials or special collections. What are the implications of having an abundant humanities library? \nAs a greater amount of these materials becomes available in digital format, there is growing evidence that humanists might adopt data-driven research or teaching methods that are typically common in the sciences. The multi-institutional \"Digging into Data\" request for proposals represents an example of this new frontier. The Roman de la Rose Digital Library led by the Johns Hopkins University represents a useful case study in this realm. Choudhury will discuss the implications of the Rose Digital Library for digital librarians and scholars and offer ideas about how humanists might consider developing and leveraging cyberinfrastructure across domains.\n",

Understanding what the videogame industry itself is doing with the concept art, tools, and other records they create is an important step to ensure that these increasingly important artifacts are preserved for future generations. In this talk, Rachel Donahue, doctoral student at the iSchool, will discuss her findings from a preliminary survey of videogame industry (and player community) preservation and records management practices.\n",

Reenactments were among the experiments in communication across knowledge worlds that began to take particular form in the nineties. Science-styled television documentary forms, internet repurposings, museum exhibitions, and academic historiographies worked hard to shape an array of cognitive sensations accessed, skilled and displayed by new technologies. These experiments became epistemological melodramas of identity, national interests, and global restructuring that tried to solve the tricky mapping problems of addressing many audiences simultaneously.\n",

The Preserving Virtual Worlds project is actively exploring methods for preserving digital games and interactive fiction. Major activities include developing basic standards for metadata and content representation and conducting a series of archiving case studies for early video games, electronic literature and Second Life, an interactive multiplayer game. Project partners are the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (lead), the University of Maryland, Stanford University, Rochester Institute of Technology and Linden Lab. Second Life content participants include Life to the Second Power, Democracy Island and the International Spaceflight Museum. The Preserving Virtual Worlds project is funded by the Preserving Creative America initiative under the National Digital Information Infrastructure Preservation Program (NDIIPP) administered by the Library of Congress. In this MITH Research Update, we will discuss the current state of the project eighteen months into the grant cycle, and suggest directions for future research.\n",

        "description": "What happens when undergraduate students are encouraged to create false history and then post it online for all the world to see? In this talk, Professor Mills Kelly, Associate Director of the Center for History and New Media, will discuss the results of a recent course he taught called \"Lying About the Past\" in which his students created an online historical hoax that fooled a fair number of people (including several professors). Along the way the students worked harder than any group of students he's taught in more than a dozen years in the college classroom. What lessons can we learn about teaching and digital culture from his experiences? Come to the talk and find out.\n",

        "description": "This talk considers how the scholarly edition (whether print or digital) processes information via formalization, and about the implications of this for our understanding and practice of digital scholarly editing. More specifically, I identify a basic concern with the protocols governing best practices in digital text editing — namely, XML markup with a TEI schema. Because of such protocols and their associated transformations, online scholarly editions are vitiated by a gap between the edition as formalized in markup language and the edition as encountered by the end user. Part of my argument is on behalf of fuller transparency for online projects, which need to turn themselves inside out on demand. Scholar-users need to know more about the provenance of the data they encounter in web environments and not remain satisfied with the orchestrated performances that the interface runs.\n",

        "talk title": "How to Play XML",
        "description": "What is a “game”? A definition is famously difficult. Wittgenstein, for example, after having described language as a game in his Philosophical Investigations, goes on to problematize the question of what a game is, using the word (“Spiel” in German) as a vivid example of the contingency and provisional nature of the supposedly clear concepts communicated by language. Game Theory, a branch of mathematics, solves this question by avoiding it, providing its own definition of “game,” which only partially fits many or most games as we know them. And talking about games becomes really interesting when we reflect, as is inescapable since Peter Suber coined the term “nomic game” in 1982, that part of the action of many games, and indeed the essence of some, is in the process, play or competition of providing the game itself with its rules and hence its definition. Originally developed in reference to legislative systems as an illustration of “a game of self-amendment,” Suber’s rule set for the game “Nomic” quickly took on a life of its own and spawned a thought industry related to economics, sociology and anthropology, life sciences, psychology and politics.\nMarkup technologies such as HTML, XML and everything that go with them, from schemas to processing languages to public specifications and standards, have many game-like aspects. As in many games, much of the activity of markup technologies is devoted to rules enforcement; it also, in nomic fashion, extends to breaking received rules and making new ones. An engagement with markup technologies, or with any media production or software application design that relies on them, demands tactics and strategy, presenting us with problems and tradeoffs enmeshed in complexities both on and off the board, and challenging us to decide not only how we play, but what game we wish to be playing. Not only that, but the deeper we go, the more nomic it gets. As we ponder what we are doing with markup technologies and how they are changing what else we do — as scholars, teachers, publishers and creative producers — it is well if we reflect on who is making the rules, how, for whose benefit, and whether, to what extent and how we might aspire to be doing this ourselves.\n",

        "talk title": "Are Robots Real? The Robot as an Object of Study",
        "description": "This talk explores the figure of the robot as an object of study, and one that specifically requires an integration of methodologies from both the humanities and the sciences. Traditionally, the figure of the robot has been regarded very differently in these two realms: in the sciences, it is related to the promises of scientific inquiry, and motivates research and innovation in actual technological applications, or the future possibility for such applications. In the humanities, however, the robot is a figure of fiction and science fiction, which, despite its un-reality channels feelings about culture and technology, difference and justice, often in indirect ways. After exploring the implications and fundamental trends of the two modes, the paper proposes that an integrated interdisciplinary methodology would allow us to better understand the attraction and meaning of the robot as a figure, without resorting to the binary opposition between fantasy and reality. Using examples from fiction, popular culture, recent scientific applications and research in robotics, I argue that the two approaches fuel each other: as cultural figures, robots are both real and imaginary, and indeed it is often their imaginary qualities that fuel and inspire actual research. Despite the claims of roboticists that real robots are immanent, the cultural power and meaning of robots comes from their fictional and literary tradition, indeed from their unreality, their virtuality.\n",

        "description": "The Archimedes Palimpsest is a manuscript of extraordinary importance to the history of science. This thirteenth century prayer book contains erased texts that were written several centuries earlier still. These erased texts include two treatises by Archimedes that can be found nowhere else, The Method and Stomachion. The manuscript sold at auction to a private collector on the 29th October 1998. The owner deposited the manuscript at The Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland, a few months later. Since that date the manuscript has been the subject of conservation, imaging and scholarship, in order to better read the texts. The Archimedes Palimpsest project, as it is called, has shed new light on Archimedes and revealed new texts from the ancient world. It has also generated a great deal of public curiosity, as well as the interest of scholars throughout the world. On 29th October 2008, we celebrated the ten year anniversary of the project. What was erased text, in terrible condition, impossible to access, and yet foundational to the history and science of the West, is now legible, and instantly available for free on the Web. This talk will cover the evolution of the project as well as its future directions.\n",

        "description": "Come hear us talk about the creation and significance of our multimedia website dedicated to the funeral procession of Sir Philip Sidney, which took place in London, England in 1587. With a panoply of visual, poetic, and musical records, the funeral survives as one of the most thoroughly documented Elizabethan public events, and the distribution of the funeral ephemera to the public made it possible for Sidney's contemporaries to recreate simulacra of the funeral in their own parlors. We will discuss why and how we have 're-done' this famous courtier-poet's obsequies, hopefully giving inspiration and insight to those of you who would like to direct similar projects. Extensive collaborative work, interdisciplinary and interinstitutional cooperation, and contributions from both grad and undergrad students have enabled us to create a project with both scholarly and pedagogical value on a low budget and with gusto.\n",

        "description": "The International Children's Digital Library (ICDL) is a full-text library of children's books from around the world that is freely available via the Internet. Developed by an interdisciplinary, intergenerational research team at the University of Maryland, the collection currently includes contemporary and historic children's books in 48 languages from 60 countries. The interface is available in sixteen languages. Although originally developed for children from ages 3-13, the research team has been working on extending the ICDL for use by other audiences and available on other platforms. Through partnerships with the Universities of Florida, Connecticut, and Minnesota, as well as the Boston Public Library, four special collections of historic children's materials, which may be of particular interest to humanities scholars, are now available.\nThe members of the technology team have created a new prototype that explores how the simplicity of the ICDL interface can be extended to a broader set of content for a wider audience. This new interface targets content for adults and adult users. Working with the Boston Public Library, this first effort demonstrates its application to 1,500 books from John Adams' collection in the Open Content Alliance (OCA). The Team also has built a new prototype that extends the reach of the ICDL to mobile phones. An iPhone application that offers four books in multiple languages using a special \"ClearText\" technology that makes the picture books readable even on these small screens, will be available soon. Members of the ICDL research team will describe the new special collections, demonstrate the new technologies, and discuss the project's goal of using technology to deliver the widest range of books to the widest range of audiences.\n",

        "description": "With the exception of a few exemplary projects, geospatial information technology has played a surprisingly a small role in humanities scholarship, given the importance of space and place to historical and literary understanding. However, the ubiquity of easy mapping interfaces and handheld devices is now bringing GIS to the attention of researchers beyond science, architecture, and engineering. The Scholars' Lab at the University of Virginia Library is developing a new technical infrastructure and discovery mechanism to aggregate and visually layer terabytes of its own geospatial data with open-access information on the Web. But can we design a system to meet the special interpretive requirements of the humanities? How can we serve disciplines for which subjectivity inflects results, and ambiguous or contradictory evidence necessarily shapes every map?\n",

        "description": "A conversation about the long history and seemingly unlikely combination of warfare and gaming, and the representation of war and militarism in computer and board games (for example, the official Pentagon recruiting game America's Army). Questions to consider might include: how can the procedural mechanisms of a game capture the chaos of lived experience that is a battle? What are the ethics of \"playing\" with war? How do we evaluate the professionalization of gaming and simulation in relation to modernity? How do games function as sites of resistance or mobilization among \"Generation Kill\" (the title of the recent book and miniseries by Evan Wright and David Simon)? This will be an exploratory roundtable discussion for those interested in the topic, not a lecture. Professor Kirschenbaum will have examples on display from his personal collection of several hundred boardgames; attendees are likewise encouraged to bring copies of games they would like to discuss.

First, it identifies the videogame itself as a text in the general sense: the object of study, the type of artifact which is here subjected to analysis. Second, the specific textual phenomenon which will be the focus of this presentation is, literally, videogame text—that is, the design, appearance, and uses of alphanumeric characters within videogames. By situating videogame typography in an appropriate historical, cultural, and technological context, an analysis of letter and number forms and their uses on the videogame screen can yield insights into the design history and dissemination of videogame texts. Further, the aesthetic properties of videogame text are shown to be one means by which specific videogame platforms express their influence over videogame discourse. This presentation, which summarizes the major research of my dissertation, will focus on typography in early videogame systems. It will also include a demonstration of a data-mining tool developed for this purpose.\n",

        "description": "Well into the second decade of the web, many aspiring digital humanists still find it difficult to mount online exhibitions and publish collections-based research because they lack either technical skills or sufficient funding to pay high priced web design vendors. The digital libraries and archives fields have produced high quality repository and collections management software, but these packages carry too much technical overhead and pay too little attention to web presentation and end user interface for most digital humanities projects. Commercial blog packages have made it easy for digital humanists to publish materials to the web, but the blog’s structure of serial text posts does not allow them to present deep collections or complex narratives.\nThat is why the Center for History and New Media (CHNM) at George Mason University, in partnership with the Minnesota Historical Society, has created [Omeka](https://web.archive.org/web/20200818093303/http://www.omeka.org/). From the Swahili word meaning “to display” or “to lay out for discussion,” Omeka is a next generation web publishing platform for academic work of all kinds, one that bridges the university, library, and museum worlds through–and by helping to advance–a set of commonly recognized web and metadata standards. Omeka is free and open source. It offers low installation and maintenance costs–appealing to individual scholars and smaller cultural heritage projects and institutions that lack technical staffs and large budgets. It is standards based, extensible, and interoperable–insuring compliance with accessibility guidelines and integration with existing digital collections systems to help digital humanists of all stripes design online exhibitions more efficiently. Omeka brings Web 2.0 technologies and approaches to digital humanities websites–fostering the kind of user interaction and participation that are central to the mission of digital humanities, and providing the contribution mechanisms, tagging facilities, and social networking tools that audiences are coming to expect.\n",

        "description": "I want to ask the related questions of where we are and where we are headed in the digital humanities. Since I am an historian, I approach these questions by asking where we have been and how we got here. Digital Humanities 1.0 was the use of information technology and computing to produce forms of scholarship that literally could not be done in the analog age: the encoding of text (TEI), computational linguistics and the creation of humanities databases (Perseus) were the two most prominent examples. DH 2.0 was the era inaugurated by IATH and scholars such as Jerry McGann, Ed Ayers and others in reconceptualizing traditional humanities questions through the intellectual power of technology — relating text to image, creating complexly interrelated databases, use of large-scale digitization. DH 3.0 is where I hope we are, searching for a new order of technical possibilities that will change modes of thought. DH 3.0 assumes the technology and moves on to give primary consideration to intellectual problems that were inconceivable in either the analog or early digital eras. The challenge is no longer either the usage of technology or the linking of technology to more or less traditional humanities problems, but reconceptualizing the problems. But of course all of this assumes what is not true — that we put a digital humanities infrastructure into place.\n",

        "description": "For our first Digital Dialogue of the new academic year, come learn about recently completed work at MITH funded by an NEH Digital Humanities Start Up grant. The Ajax XML Encoder (AXE) allows users with limited technical knowledge to add metadata to text, image, video, and audio files. Users can collaboratively tag a text in TEI, associate XML with time stamps in video or audio files, and mark off regions of an image to be linked to external metadata. With an intuitive, web-based interface, AXE makes the process of preparing online digital editions and archives more efficient and accurate. AXE also facilitates collaboration in the digital humanities by permitting multiple scholars to work on the same document or archive at the same time from various locations, and will track all work so that variant versions can be collated and all versions can be archived. The Ajax XML encoder, with its intuitive Web-based interface, will come as a breath of fresh air to those who have previously been frustrated by text-centric tagging tools which require an expert knowledge of mark-up languages.\n",

        "description": "In this talk I will discuss early cinema as new media in the context of my recent book, _Body Shots: Cinema's Incarnations, 1893-1904_ (University of California Press, 2007). _Body Shots_ puts the human body at the center of cinema's first decade of emergence, arguing for the complexity, richness, and sophistication of these moving corporeal representations as both formal objects and culturally resonant ones. Rather than treat the body as primarily marking identity—gendered, racial, national—or invoke it to make claims about early cinema's sensational attractions in relation to modernity (two common approaches to the subject), I begin by focusing on films that reveal striking anxieties and preoccupations about persons on public display, both exceptional figures, such as 1896 presidential candidate William McKinley, as well as ordinary people self-consciously caught by the movie camera in their daily routines. The book closes with a meditation on early cinema and death (when the body stops moving), with implications for new media and technology studies more generally.\n",

        "description": "Since its official launch in 2003, Second Life, the popular 3D interactive world created by Linden Lab, has become an unlikely destination for librarians, bibliophiles, authors, readers, publishers, booksellers, and book artists. At the center of this nexus of users is the book itself, a virtual artifact that differs from its physical counterpart by being comprised of bits, not atoms; of textures, animated scripts, and geometric primitives rather than paper, ink, cloth, and thread. In this talk I will examine the infrastructure that supports this in-world bibliographic culture: specifically, the technologies used to create and read SL books; the social networks designed to promote and popularize them; the information services to collect, access, curate, and catalogue them; and the legal and economic systems developed to commodify them. I will look at how the Second Life platform conditions our ideas of \"bookness\" by presenting us with interfaces for reading that borrow incongruously from print and manuscript traditions, first-person shooter games, and even military aviation. And I will suggest that the mixed economy of Real Life and Second Life makes it necessary to understand these immersive books as compound objects that exist within a system of relationships that include both in-world and out-world content, thereby complicating efforts to study, link, document, and preserve them. The talk will also include a demonstration of books I have made in SL and discuss future projects.\n",

        "description": "Many of you will have seen the news about MITH's most recent grant activity, a new NEH/JISC funded project on digitizing Shakespeare's Quartos undertaken in collaboration with the Folger Shakespeare Library, the British Library, the Bodleian at Oxford, and various other prestigious institutions. More detail is available [here](http://www.newsdesk.umd.edu/culture/release.cfm?ArticleID=1620). \nThe nearly $120,000 NEH grant will provide initial funds for one year to create a technical proof of concept \"working model\" for the project by digitizing all 32 pre-1641 versions of Hamlet held by the participating libraries. \"The JISC/NEH initiative gave us the opportunity and the incentive to attempt a truly international, collaborative, digital project,\" says Folger Project Director RICHARD KUHTA. \"The guidelines challenged us to think collectively about what was possible, and to realize a shared ambition. It was exactly the prompt we needed to launch a conversation that transformed geographically distant collections into partner institutions.\" NEIL FRAISTAT adds, \"We are proud to have as partners such institutions as the Folger Shakespeare Library, the Huntington Library, the British Library, and the Bodleian Library of Oxford University. This grant caps what has been an extraordinary year for MITH, in which it has received five major grants, covering the gamut from Shakespeare's Quartos to the preservation of Virtual Worlds.\" \nIn this Digital Dialogue, we will introduce the project to the university community, solicit initial feedback, and discuss ways to involve interested constituents as our work progresses. The discussion will be led by NEIL FRAISTAT (Professor of English and Director, MITH), JIM KUHN (Head of Collection Information Services, Folger), RICHARD KHUTA (Librarian, Folger), and DOUG RESIDE (Assistant Director, MITH).\n",

She will demonstrate how the elaborate Mandrake form operates, reveal her inspirations for the form, and discuss how the form evolved as it came into being. In addition, she will discuss how this originally paper-based kinetic poem came to be transformed into its current Flash-animated state, and enumerate the strengths and weaknesses of its two existent forms (its physical form on the printed page, and its digital Flash-animated form), especially as compared to its ideal form which currently exists only in concept.\n",

This presentation examines the role of computer gaming in composition pedagogy, positioning games as objects of critique that are available for use in writing classes, and as locations of production for multimedia/multimodal texts. Using the example of massive multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), Dr. Eyman will present a five-part ecological framework for situating game activities as specific genres of production that can be used in writing classes.\n",

The GSO plays classical arrangements of music and scores from popular video games; no tinny Pac-Man Fever jingles here, rather music that brings to life the richness and breadth of the complex auditory soundscapes surrounding contemporary games like Halo, World of Warcraft, and Final Fantasy. \nThe GSO is composed of students from UMD as well as the surrounding community. Join us for a discussion and samples of their unique performances with music director CHRIS APPLE, conductor and arranger GREG COX, and president JARRED YOUNG. \nFor more information, including photos and recordings of their music, visit the [GSO](http://www.umgso.com/).\n",

        "talk title": "On the Internet, Everybody Thinks I'm a Dog",
        "description": "\"On the Internet, Everybody Thinks I'm a Dog\" represents Marilee Lindemann's coming out as a blogger in her professional life. Although Roxie's World is a blog written by an academic, it is not an \"academic blog\" in the usual sense. It is a creative experiment in punditry, topical humor, and cultural commentary offered in the voice of a 13-year-old wire-haired fox terrier—Roxie—who has a leaky heart and a laptop. Roxie's major preoccupations are politics, pop culture, and basketball. Her stance is that of a dogged progressive fascinated by the queer doings of Homo sapiens. Though Roxie is a purebred, Lindemann's lecture is a mongrel mixture of critical reflection on her own practices as a blogger and analysis of what blogging can teach us about reading, writing, and social networking in the twenty-first century. Situated at the intersection of canine cultural studies, queer/feminist studies, and an emerging discourse of blog studies, the presentation takes up issues of persona, parody, and irony in connection with a post-9/11 politics of dissent; of building and tracking real and imagined audiences in the blogosphere; of the complex role played by words, images, and sound in the grammar and in the world-making aspirations of blogs; and of satirical self-publication as a healthy response to the conditions of academic work under late capitalism.\n",

        "description": "In May of 2007, MITH received the extraordinary gift of Deena Larsen's personal collection of early-era personal computers and software. Deena is an author and new media visionary who has been active in the creative electronic writing community nearly since its inception in the 1980s. In addition to being a writer and thinker, Deena has also been a collector and an amateur archivist (or, as we say of amateurs, a hoarder). Collecting and hoarding, it turns out, are very important activities, since too few of our cultural institutions and repositories are yet engaged with acquiring and saving the rich and various creative legacy we have inherited from the first generation of personal computing. The arrival of Deena's collection at MITH furnishes us with invaluable source material which will further both our in-house research in digital curation and preservation, as well as function as a primary resource for researchers interested in early hypertext and electronic literature. This talk will introduce the collection to the MITH community, and discuss future research agendas. We intend a wide-ranging conversation, from the practicalities and ethics of preservation to the implications of born-digital material for textual and editorial theory.\nThis talk will introduce the collection to the MITH community, and discuss future research agendas.

        "description": "The Internet Archive was founded eleven years ago by Brewster Kahle to build the world's first \"Internet Library.\" Since 1996, the Archive has been collecting bi-monthly snapshots of the World Wide Web—the entire Web—resulting in a cumulative collection of approximately 100 billion Web pages. This cumulative historical record can be browsed and viewed using the Wayback Machine, an access interface developed by the [Internet Archive](http://www.archive.org). The Archive has since expanded its activities to include book scanning, audio collections, video and still image collections and Open Education Resources (videotaped lectures for entire college-level courses and the supporting materials.) These collections comprise over two petabytes of data, stored in the Archive's Digital Repository in San Francisco. The Internet Archive is active in the open-source software community and has developed several widely used tools for web harvesting, search, and management of clustered storage environments. The Archive is dedicated to open source principles; accordingly all software used and developed by the Internet Archive is open source and open access. As an active technology partner in the academic, library and research communities, the Archive has become both a storage partner and content source for educators and researchers. Its role as a unifier of open access content sources is growing through collaborative projects in book scanning and access, large collections of imagery and other content formats, as well as its roles as administrator of the [Open Content Alliance](http://www.opencontentalliance.org) and as a co-founder of the [International Internet Preservation Consortium](http://www.iipc.org). The Archive is engaging in several projects that can directly serve educators and researchers in the Digital Humanities community. In this talk, LINDA FRUEH will describe the collections, projects and capabilities of the Internet Archive, and hopes to generate lively discussion in how the Archive can work to better support the conduct of Digital Humanities studies.\n",

        "description": "Since the mid-nineties, the problem of long-term archiving and preservation of digital information has received considerable attention by major archiving communities, library organizations, government agencies, scientific and private organizations. These studies have identified major challenges regarding technology infrastructure, institutional and business models, and social and legal frameworks, which need to be addressed to achieve long-term reliable access to digital information. In this talk, we will give a brief overview of our approach, called ADAPT (Approach to Digital Archiving and Preservation Technology), to build a platform-independent infrastructure based on a set of reconfigurable tools that use open standards and Web technologies. Our approach can easily accommodate emerging standards and policies, and will evolve gracefully as the underlying technologies change. These tools have been coordinated with our collaborators at the National Archives, the Library of Congress, and the San Diego Supercomputer Center.\n",

        "description": "\"The degree to which American society has embraced and absorbed computer technologies is astonishing. The degree to which the changes provoked by computers leave prevailing inequalities is troubling.\" --Special Issue, \"From Hard Drive to Software: Gender, Computers, and Difference, \"Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society (August 1990--yes, you read the date correctly). \nIn the wake of the sixties, the humanities in general and their standings in particular had suffered, according to some, from being feminized by the messy considerations of gender, race, sexuality, class. For some, humanities computing and digital humanities seemed to offer a space free from all this messiness and a return to \"objective\" questions of representation. In 2007, asking some obvious, basic questions seems more than in order: Are digital humanities and new media important for feminist cultural, social, and intellectual work? Concomitantly, can feminism enhance and improve the world and work of computer science, of humanities computing, of digital humanities? Questions basic to feminist critical inquiry are certainly worth asking of our digital work: How do items of knowledge, organizations, working groups come into being? Who made them? For what purposes? Whose work is visible, what is happening when only certain actors and associated achievements come into public view? What happens when social order is assumed to be an objective feature of social life (i.e., uninformed by ethnomethodology)? What counts as innovation: why are tools valorized and whose work in their development and in their application is recognized? These and other questions posed by the group will be examined in this collaborative exchange.\n",

        "description": "Art has never been a mere mirror up to nature, yet as in no other medium has it been so easy to create a simulacra of reality as with digital technology: a 'heterocosm', both simulating the familiar while deconstructing it. This talk will explore how mimesis might be used as a paradigm from which to explore the relationship between digital surrogates and their analogue counterparts; how familiar terms like object, imitation, copy, original function in the digital realm; and the notion that a digital representation may be more appropriately termed a simulacral identity, reflecting, not the object itself, but our beliefs and conventions about it. This talk will also briefly touch upon mimesis from the viewpoint of digital representations as conscious fashionings of hyper-reality or in Wildean terms, employing the unreal and non-existent to recreate the material world in unexpected, fresh, or subversive ways.\n",

        "description": "Digital technology has changed the way scholars research, preserve, and present humanities materials. The NEH, through its Digital Humanities Initiative (DHI), has taken a leadership position in bringing these new technologies to bear. In 2006, the American Council of Learned Societies released Our Cultural Commonwealth, which is their now-famous report on cyberinfrastructure for the humanities. This report states that: \"The emergence of the Internet has transformed the practice of the humanities and social sciences--more slowly than some may have hoped, but more profoundly than others may have expected. Digital cultural heritage resources are a fundamental dataset for the humanities: these resources, combined with computer networks and software tools, now shape the way that scholars discover and make sense of the human record, while also shaping the way their findings are communicated to students, colleagues, and the general public.\"\n[Our Cultural Commonwealth](https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/handle/2142/189) -- from Executive Summary\nThe NEH is encouraging the field to build the basic infrastructure--what we call \"cyberinfrastructure\"--needed for humanities scholarship. This includes funding the creation of tools, databases, and other technology products used for humanities research, education, public programming, and preservation. It also includes \"human infrastructure\"--that is, funding digital humanities centers and other organizations which bring together humanities scholars with computer scientists, engineers, librarians, and others towards the goal of excellent scholarship.\n",

        "description": "The emergence of a commercialized Internet is a very recent phenomenon. Historians and other scholars have examined its early history, especially its origins in the military-sponsored project ARPANET, named after the Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency. At the other end of the scale, scholars, business journalists, and others have examined the rise and fall of the \"dot.com\" phenomenon, with studies of companies including Amazon, AOL, and Google. What is missing is a study of the transition between the two: how a network funded by taxpayers, and intended for a restricted set of users for restricted purposes, evolved into a worldwide cultural phenomenon, open to all, with almost no restrictions on its use for commercial purposes. \nThis paper is based on two forthcoming books by the author: one an analysis of the commercialization of the Internet, and the other on the role of northern Virginia as a locus of Internet management and governance.\n",

        "talk title": "Simulating Liveness",
        "description": "Manuscripts, paintings, sculptures, buildings and recordings can be preserved and archived for future generations. Live theatre, however, is ephemeral. This simple fact creates a tremendous challenge for theatre scholarship and pedagogy. In an effort to compensate for theatre's evanescence, scholars and theatre artists have exploring a variety of techniques to simulate historical theatre events. The key challenge is to reproduce the viewer's immersion in the world of the theatre, and the crucial role that the community of spectators plays in constituting a performance event. \nI will examine two approaches to simulating live performance using 3D computer animation over the internet. The first is use pre-rendered animations to simulate the experience of watching a performance. The Virtual Vaudeville project exemplifies this approach, letting the viewer switch at will among multiple perspectives on a single nineteenth-century performance. The project also provides a series of hypermedia notes and a real-time flythrough of the theatre. The second approach is to create fully-interactive real-time performances online. I will offer a brief historical overview of such efforts, showing how advances in technology are rapidly making online performance feasible. In particular, I will focus on the tremendous potential — and serious limitations — of Second Life as a venue for virtual performance. Moreover, I will argue that the phenomenon of live performance in Second Life raises fundamental questions about very notion of liveness.\n",

Using project case studies from a decade of experience in this field, the presentation brings to the fore the ways in which these technologies both enforce and challenge traditional ideas of what a museum is or should be. The paper examines the evolution of simple virtual representation to modeled reconstruction and deconstruction and thence to virtual replacement of artifacts in situ at their point of creation or discovery. The presentation concludes with a look forward to the concept of massively multi-user virtual community spaces that permit a participatory experience of virtual cultural heritage.\n",

        "description": "In the various realms of digital poetry, chance and intention blend within a given structure. Authors create patterns, use collage, make links, sample media during the creative process, and readers are faced with the task of responding to a set of textual circumstances. While illustrating and introducing the basic mechanics of digital poetry, this presentation engages with works as if moves in a game of Scrabble, suggesting how expression can be further propelled using digital and analog media. Beyond the role of influence and inspiration, the output and data presented in digital poems can often be seen and used as a basis for myriad sorts of projective, progenerative language, image, or sound, which can be combined and recombined in so many variations. If literature is to be interactive, we must cultivate ways to respond to what is given, and in the process may find ourselves able to remediate materials in order to build something original.\n",

However, by visualizing certain of its patterns–by looking at the text “from a distance”–through textual analytics and visualizations, one can read the novel in ways formerly impossible and re-evaluate whether there is or is not “a there there.” This talk will focus on how various analytic methods (such as text mining and frequent pattern recognition) and visualization tools (such as FeatureLens and Spotfire) under research in the [MONK project](http://www.monkproject.org/) have been used to achieve a new \\*non\\*-reading of the text which Stein called her “masterpiece” and critiques called “linguistic murder.”\n",

        "description": "### \"Soweto '76, A Living Digital Archive\" \nby Angel David Nieves\nThe aim of Soweto '76 is to develop an interactive immersive edutainment application and multimedia interface that allows users to experience a historically recreated urban environment with the support of primary and secondary archival materials. With the creation of a historically accurate environment as a platform, users will be able to assume the role of a character from the time period, and experience their reactions to actual events from their particular vantage point. It is hoped that users of Soweto '76 will act as virtual witnesses to the events of June 16, 1976–events that catalyzed the massive student uprisings against the apartheid regime. Using existing oral histories, testimonies, photographs, video footage, material objects, and sound recordings in the collections of the Hector Pieterson Museum, the work seeks to redress the uneven portrayal of the lives of Black township residents in the mainstream or \"official\" historical record. Soweto '76 seeks to first address the absence of accounts from those students involved in the Uprisings (1) by making these multimedia texts accessible online and (2) by providing digital tools to facilitate a comparative analysis of the competing interpretations of key events. The site undertakes the challenges of collating the experiences (or \"collating the narratives\") and interpretive vantage points of the various historical and contemporary actors. The vantage point of the user changes as the various forms of multimedia data are accessed on the site. These \"collated narratives\" will include both spatial and temporal representations of the events occurring on 16 June. \n### \"In the Footsteps of the Old Heads: Saraka and Nation in the Caribbean\" \nby Merle Collins\nThis project is an exploration of African survivals and re-creations in the Caribbean island of Grenada. Conceptualized as a multi-media project, the project aims to produce a video-recording of aspects of a harvest celebration known as the saraka, and, through research and interviews, to trace the origins of the saraka and its observation by those who feel a duty to continue it because they have inherited it from their ancestors, those whom they refer to as the \"old heads\". The project aims to use current cellphone technology to disseminate information regarding various elements of the saraka as one component of its interface.\n",

        "description": "As the sheer volume and complexity of digital objects expands, content creators and data managers have come to see the need for governing policies that encompass more than just archiving and preservation issues. The concept of \"digital curation\" encompasses both archiving and preservation but stresses a holistic lifecycle management approach to creating, selecting and maintaining digital objects and metadata. Several research projects have determined that curation awareness is strongest in the data-intense hard sciences such as physics and engineering but is gaining foothold in the humanities disciplines and information repositories. This presentation will explore the broad principles of digital curation and examine its implementation through institutional case studies of libraries and archives. Finally, the presentation will open up some questions about the challenges of developing and implementing local digital curation policies.\n",

        "description": "Faculty and practitioners who work with digital pedagogies know, at least intuitively, that student learning is significantly transformed in new media environments. As all of higher education wades deeper into the learning paradigm, it is increasingly important to move our understanding of new media learning beyond generalizations about engagement, interaction, and collaboration. The Visible Knowledge Project was a six-year project engaging about 60 faculty from 21 institutions, in order to explore the impact of technology on learning, especially in the humanities. This presentation will give an overview of the broad findings from the project, and look specifically at one strand of that faculty-driven research: Digital stories/narrative. The scholarship of teaching and learning that was produced by the project focuses us in part on the expansion of our conceptions of “expertise” in student intellectual development, and the roles that new media pedagogies play in that expansion. An expanded conception of expertise might be critical to recognizing how digital pedagogies often produce forms and symptoms of learning that are elusive–if not invisible–in traditional assessments or frameworks for understanding student development. This presentation will open up some of the questions about what we recognize as learning, and especially the ways that new media pedagogies and literacies invite us to expand our recognition of learning.\n",

        "talk title": "Identifying Web 2.0: Remixing Institutional Identities",
        "description": "Established e-portfolio and CMS systems such as Blackboard and WebCT are based on storing, commenting on, and chatting about documents. They are closed to integration with other administrative, scholarly, and social networking systems on the web. These systems lack the ability to develop identities in relation to various systems, texts, and institutions. As new systems such as Zotero (GMU) and Digital Notebook (Georgetown) are being developed to take advantage of Web 2.0 capabilities such as citing, tagging, and cross referencing content across systems, the issue of identity is still in flux. On the one hand, Gregory Ulmer's work provides the theoretical grounds and pedagogical model for seeing identity formation as the basis of research. On the other hand, Hardt and Negri recognize that the modernist institutions that produce identities are breaking down. The newer CMS systems are centered on the production of a university or scholarly identity. This paper will examine the possibility of accepting the personal and subcultural identities that will inevitably emerge with the development of Web 2.0 research tools.\n",

        "description": "The Library of Congress contains over a million dissertations. Each of these works represents an average of four years of work by a specialist who has diligently and intelligently scanned, sorted, read, categorized, assessed, and annotated hundreds or thousands of primary and secondary sources. The staggering scale of this work--literally billions of person-hours in dissertation work alone, not to mention the research that went into the millions of other books those dissertations share shelf space with--should be matched by the regret academia should feel since almost all of this research is buried in filing cabinets or boxes or worse: soon-to-be obsolete digital media such as a floppy disk or the tacit knowledge of a researcher's mind. Often the most we can expect to see from all of this work, aside from the book or article it informed, is the bibliography that is buried at the end of the printed text. But what if we could use digital methods to recapture that enormous amount of scholarly work, the 90% of research that, like an iceberg, is hidden beneath the 10% of the final product? The Zotero project (which I co-direct) has released software that allows users to build, tag, and annotate their own research collections, with a high level of integration with online texts and databases; the next phase of the project will add a server through which users and groups can exchange, aggregate, and recommend digital texts and resources. If humanities researchers--professors, students, and others--widely adopted such digital tools, many parts of the scholarly process could be recaptured, and, more important, networked together. See www.zotero.org for more downloads and more information.\n",

Web 2.0 applications tend to be centered around the user by making the experience easy, allowing for flexibility and providing opportunities for the user to customize their access to information. The collaborative nature and ease of use of many of Web 2.0 tools have been embraced by faculty in the College of Arts and Humanities (ARHU). This session will introduce the basics of wiki software and share examples of its pedagogical applications. In addition, applications integrating RSS feeds to organize and share content such as audio, text and bookmarks will be introduced. These technologies have satisfied important objectives for ARHU faculty. Further discussion through this Digitial Dialogue will provide the opportunity to identify additional uses and contexts for these tools.\n",

        "description": "Previous research of judicial systems has faced a trade-off between large scale quantitative inquiries focused on readily-counted behaviors, and smaller studies that allow closer examination of legal texts. I will talk about the Digital Docket project, an NSF-funded collaboration between University of Maryland's Government and Politics Department and the College of Information Studies, which aims to apply techniques from information retrieval and computational linguistics to the study of the U.S. Supreme Court. \nBy viewing the legal system as an intricate and complex web of communication, the project aims to better understand the role and influences of various actors through analysis of written records. Those records include, for example, briefs written by litigants and other stakeholders, and opinions written by judges and justices. The application of automated content analysis techniques to model the U.S. judicial system represents an opportunity to overcome many of the bottlenecks associated with traditional manual, labor-intensive methods in political science, and also provides a new environment for the advancement of information retrieval and computational linguistic techniques.\n",

        "talk title": "Playing with Worlds: Narrative, Fiction, and the Cultural Reception of Videogames",
        "description": "When even the most perceptive scholars based in traditional, typographic forms of literacy turn their attention to videogames, the results can be disconcerting. Two of the best in this line, Janet Murray and James P. Gee, both falter notably when they ask when, if, or how videogames can have cultural effects equivalent to literature. These moments do not represent failure so much as catastrophe, a collapse of interpretive method that may provide indications for more viable approaches. I suggest the key to a new agenda lies in the distinction of narrative, a main concern for my generation and our elders, from the sort of fiction Jesper Juul embraces in his theory of games: a form whose clearest illustration is not story or novel, but rather tableau. As Murray herself says: \"The more we see life in terms of systems, the more we need a system-modeling medium to represent it.\" But systematic or procedural systems cannot simply be interpreted or read as if they were conventionally inscribed texts. As Espen Aarseth argues, they must be played; and I would argue further that critics must also engage in the kind of fictive play from which games emerge. I suggest it is no accident that many of the most interesting new critics of the videogame, figures like Ian Bogost and Mary Flanagan, are active game developers, and argue more generally that videogames and other forms of cybertext require a more engaged, creative commitment from their critics.\n",

        "description": "While many humanities scholars have explored how computers might assist them in their work, there have been very few attempts to use electronic tools to study the musical. Musical theatre seems particularly well-suited, though, to the multimedia capabilities of the modern PC. This presentation will explore the ways in which electronic editions of musicals would not only be of use to musical theatre scholars, but might also help to develop a wider audience for artistically-minded (as opposed to commercially-driven) musicals. This talk outlines the benefits offered by electronic editions and describes the steps taken by the author to develop an AJAX-based electronic edition of the 1998 musical Parade.\n",

        "description": "The Virtual Humanities Lab was a two-year project, generously supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities for 2004-06. VHL was housed in Italian Studies at Brown University; we have collaborated with scholars at Brown, and throughout North America and Europe. First, we employed humanities scholars previously unfamiliar with semantic text encoding. The scholars were tasked with studying two information-rich primary sources — by encoding them using idiosyncratic encoding structures. This required training and various types of support, and was complicated by the scholars’ disparate geographical locations. We also made contact with a group in Mexico that is studying one of our texts, Giovanni Boccaccio’s _Expositions on the Divine Comedy_. We’ve set up a discussion forum for them to do their work using our encoded text. Finally, we collaborated amongst ourselves across three continents on writing papers, designing the VHL interface, and further textual analysis.\nAt MITH, I will talk about the results of these different types of collaboration. I will relate what worked well (a strategic blend of facetime and online communication) and what could have worked better (training humanists in the fundamentals of humanities computing). I will stress and illustrate the importance that collaboration has begun to play in the humanities, and propose to introduce collaboration more substantively into humanities research, arguing for its benefits over our usual solitary work.\n",

        "description": "MITH currently has several research initiatives pending in the area of online gaming, especially Massively Multiplayer Role Playing Games (MMRPGS). MMRPGs such as Second Life and World of Warcraft create complex social, narrative, and imaginative spaces that have been the subject of important recent books by Edward Castronova and Henry Jenkins, among others. Far from merely idle pastimes, these virtual worlds, or simulations, manifest increasingly vexed relations to our own daily realities. Castronova has calculated that one of the most popular and longest running games, EverQuest, has a real world economy whose GNP places it somewhere between that of Bulgaria and Russia; Reuters, meanwhile, has just opened a news bureau within Second Life, where it might be expected to cover events such as a Suzanne Vega concert that unfolded entirely within that world's virtual setting. \nOn Tuesday we are interested in talking with persons/players active in one or more of these game worlds. We want \\*you\\* to come and educate \\*us\\* about your experiences, we want to get feedback on our current proposed work, and we want to discuss the possibility of creating an interest group for those interested in discussing MMRPGs at some kind of regular interval.\n",

I'll begin by describing the unique characteristics of the oral history collection that we are using, in which Holocaust survivors, witnesses and rescuers were interviewed in several languages. Each interview has been digitized and extensively catalogued by subject matter experts, thus producing a remarkably rich collection for the application of machine learning techniques. \nAutomatic speech recognition techniques originally developed for the domain of conversational telephone speech were adapted to process with word error rates that are adequate to support interactive search and automated clustering, detection of topic shifts, and topic classification. In this talk, I will describe the studies that we conducted to learn about what needs our systems should be designed to meet and I'll summarize key results from our system development activities. I'll conclude with some remarks about possible future directions for research applying new technologies to improve intellectual access to oral history and other spoken word collections.\n",

        "description": "In the last four years, broad, collaborative authoring (for example, Wikipedia), collection building (for example, September 11 Digital Archive and Hurricane Digital Memory Bank) and organization of information (for example, folksonomies) have emerged as forms of social computing. Advocates champion the democratic nature of the collaboration. Critics decry the lack of provenance and thus trustworthiness of the information gathered in this way. Clearly, though, the technology and techniques can support both democratic collaboration and the collaboration of experts. Such technology and techniques offer an opportunity to advance the application of computing to teaching and research beyond the margins.\n",

        "description": "This talk will explore the use of digital media to depict and account for medieval notions of authority, translation, and textual transmission, concepts that are often excluded from or distorted by print editions. Whereas print editions of medieval literary texts typically treat the presence of competing textual versions, authors, and manuscript witnesses as a problem to resolve, either by recreating a hypothetical authorial text or choosing the best extant text to represent an entire textual or narrative tradition, digital manuscript archives are increasingly fostering a re-emergence of the simultaneous presence of competing voices and authorial roles. Digital media are thus allowing us an opportunity to \"get medieval\" in our representations of texts in a manner unprecedented in the age of print. Examples will be drawn from my work on three manuscript archives--the Roman de la Rose Digital Surrogates Project, the Piers Plowman Electronic Archive, and the Siege of Jerusalem Electronic Archive. No familiarity with medieval texts or textual traditions will be assumed or necessary to follow or participate in this discussion!\n",

Come together and learn from your community and from your world.\" More information about The September Project is [available here](http://www.theseptemberproject.org/). \nThere are over 400 libraries and other institutions participating world-wide. MITH's contribution will take the form of a roundtable Digital Dialogue on the [September 11th Digital Archive](http://www.911digitalarchive.org/). \nAccording to the site, \"The September 11 Digital Archive uses electronic media to collect, preserve, and present the history of the September 11, 2001 attacks in New York, Virginia, and Pennsylvania and the public responses to them.\"\nA few questions to get us started (please do come with questions of your own): What does it mean to “archive” 9/11 on the Web? What are the boundaries of this particular Web site \\*as\\* an archive? What new or unique role do born digital materials–email, cell phone text messages, digital photographs and video, blogs, and mainstream media sites–play in the memory and preservation of 9/11? What are the particular issues and challenges involved: ethical, historiographical, and technical? How else has the Web contributed to an archiving or preservation of 9/11, including the widely viewed alternative history (“conspiracy”) documentaries digitally distributed from YouTube and similar sites?\n",

        "description": "Staking and Stewart will offer critical reflections on a successful workshop they facilitated at the National Women’s Studies Association Conference in June 2006. The workshop, “Visualizing Women’s Studies: Facilitating Visual Learning in the Feminist Classroom,” was designed to assist feminist instructors to better integrate visual concepts and visual technologies into their women’s studies curricula. Like many interdisciplinary social-justice-oriented humanities fields, one of central aims of women’s studies teaching is assisting students to “see” the world differently. And yet many feminist instructors–instructors who are deeply invested in teaching students how to resist sexism in the visual landscape–struggle with teaching visual literacy. Many also feel intimidated by the prospect of using technology in the classroom. At this Digital Dialogue, Staking and Stewart will share how they successfully worked with a somewhat technology-a-phobic population of instructors to inspire them to take more risks to integrate digital technologies into their humanities teaching.

It is designed to make this arcane but important body of knowledge accessible to students and other non-specialists who can use it in the study of modern Chinese dialects, classical literature, and historical linguistics.\n**\"The Steinschneider Bibliographical Database: Digitizing a Classic Reference Work for Arabic and Latin Premodern Philosophy, Science, Medicine, and Literature Translated into Hebrew\"** by Chip Manekin, _Associate Professor of Philosophy_ \nIn 1893 the Austrian Jewish scholar Moritz Steinschneider published the crowning achievement of a long and distinguished scholarly career — a thousand page bibliographical essay (in German) entitled The Hebrew Translations of the Middle Ages, and the Jews as Transmitters. For over a century, the Hebrew Translations of the Middle Ages has been the primary reference source for medieval Jewish philosophy, science, medicine, and literature, translated from the Arabic and Latin into Hebrew. It is the classic work on the translation movement of the High Middle Ages from Arabic and Latin into Hebrew. Over a century old, it has never been translated, revised, or updated. The Steinschneider Bibliographical Database (SBD), a project of MITH and funded in part by an NEH collaborative grant, will be a fully searchable English translation, revision, and update of Steinschneider’s work prepared by scholars in Germany, Israel, and the US that will be available to scholars on the world wide web. As part of the website scholars will be able to consult digital images of Steinschneider’s own annotated copy of the original German, as well the fifteen-hundred page handwritten French memoire that preceded the German print edition.\n",

As opposed to a traditional thesaurus, MLTMS will work as both a termbase for web-based search and retrieval as well as a research database for the deconstruction of historical hierarchical ontologies as expressed by contributing classification systems. MLTMS is intended as a long-term and inter-disciplinary project focused on the European Middle Ages. Currently in its infancy, the software will ultimately researchers to do web-based search and retrieval of both primary evidence (in corpora) and argument (in journals and books). The technology will be open source. \n**\"Creating Digital Versions of Early 20th Century African-American Texts: Nannie Burroughs' 1928 'What the Negro Wants Politically.'\"** by Michele Mason The Washington Post called the 1928 presidential election, \"the bitterest and most baffling presidential campaign of more than a generation.\" During the campaign, civil rights leader Nannie Burroughs campaigned tirelessly for the Republican party. As a spokesperson for the Republican National Committee, Burroughs issued statements through the press and delivered dozens of speeches on behalf of Herbert Hoover. When the election was over Burroughs wrote \"What the Negro Wants Politically,\" offering a brief analysis of the racial dimensions of the election and issuing a set of political demands to the Republican party. Published in several African-American newspapers, Burroughs' article reached a large national audience. In this presentation I will discuss the significance of Burroughs' editorial, along with the advantages a digital version of the text offers.\n",

        "description": "MITH is pleased to offer two of its current or recent faculty Fellows the opportunity to discuss their ongoing work in digital humanities. Please join us for these two presentations. \n**\"The Early Americas Digital Archive\"** by Ralph Bauer, Associate Professor of English\nThe Early Americas Digital Archive (EADA) is a collection of electronic texts and links to texts originally written in or about the Americas from 1492 to approximately 1820. It is open to the public for research and teaching purposes. It is intended as a long-term and inter-disciplinary project in progress committed to exploring the intersections between traditional humanities research and digital technologies and invites scholars from all disciplines to submit their editions of early American texts for publication. \n**\"Occupied Japan, 1945-1952: Gender, Class, Race\"** by Marlene Mayo, Associate Professor of History\nThe site contains nineteen themes, biographies of eighteen leading and lesser known women, numerous images, and a wide range of texts ranging from fiction and poetry to oral histories and official documents. The site is intended for use not only in Japanese and East Asian History courses but also for American History, American Studies, Women's Studies, and Comparative Government and Politics.\n",

        "description": "In contrast to the first decade of literary production in the electronic media, when most critical attention was focused on link and node hypertext fiction and its relationship to postmodern theory, in recent years the field of new media studies has embraced a wider definition of Nelsonian \"hypertext\" to include a variety of forms of literary expression that branch or perform on request. A field once dominated by Storyspace fiction now includes in its purview a wide variety of approaches to literary expression made for the computer and the network, including kinetic poetry, interactive fiction, combinatory writing, story and poetry generation, and network-mediated memoir. During the talk I will present examples of recent work in electronic literature submitted to the forthcoming Electronic Literature Collection [of which MITH is a co-sponsor] in the context of genre.\n",

        "description": "Creativity Support Tools is a research topic with high risk but potentially very high payoff. The goal is to develop improved software and user interfaces that empower diverse users in the sciences and arts to be more productive, and more innovative. Potential users include a combination of software and other engineers, diverse scientists, product and graphic designers, and architects, as well as writers, poets, musicians, new media artists, and many others. \nEnhanced interfaces could enable more effective searching of intellectual resources, improved collaboration among teams, and more rapid discovery processes. These advanced interfaces should also provide potent support in goal setting, speedier exploration of alternatives, improved understanding through visualization, and better dissemination of results. For creative endeavors that require composition of novel artifacts (computer programs, engineering diagrams, symphonies, animations, artwork), enhanced interfaces could facilitate rapid exploration of alternatives, prevent unproductive choices, and enable easy backtracking. \nThis NSF-sponsored workshop (June 2005, [www.cs.umd.edu](http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/CST)) brought together 25 research leaders and graduate students to share experiences, identify opportunities, and formulate research challenges. Two key outcomes emerged: \n1. Formulation of guidelines for design of creativity support tools.\n2. Novel research methods to assess creativity support tools. \nThe next step is planning for the June 2007 Conference on Creativity and Cognition in Washington, DC. The talk is also meant to invite participation in organizing this event.\n",

        "talk title": "\"Mined to Death\"",
        "description": "Produced, scripted, and filmed by Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) Fellow Regina Harrison who will lead a discussion after the screening, this 40 minute documentary with Spanish subtitles--which also exists in a Spanish version titled \"Mina adentro\" (with English subtitles)--depicts miners in Potosi, Bolivia, who extract silver, zinc, and lead from the mountain in the same precarious conditions as their ancestors did five centuries ago. Tourist agencies and transnational mining companies promise to bring in additional revenue for the miners, because the \"rich\" mountain is dying. \nFor this work Harrison received the Latin American Studies Association 2006 \"Award of Merit in Film,\" which is given for \"excellence in the visual presentation of educational and artistic materials on Latin America.\" Harrison is also the recipient of book awards from the Modern Language Association and the Latin American Studies Association. This is her first award for film. The project was filmed with the MITH Canon GL1 digital camera in 2003 and 2004, but the 2004 digital cassettes were stolen in Bolivia after three weeks of filming. Despite this setback, she then bought her own Canon GL2 to return to the labyrinth of mine tunnels to film again in 2005. Harrison, as a MITH fellow, received training in film technique from MITH fellow April Householder and from MITH Advisory Board member Irvin Kershner. Campus funding from CAPA, MITH, and ARHU DRI funds, as well as maintenance funds from Fulbright-Hays, helped defray the costs of several years of travel, filming, and editing.\n",

Anyone with an interest in the book is welcome to attend. \n_Pattern Recognition_ has been widely received as Gibson's most significant and prescient work since he coined the term \"cyberspace\" in 1984. \"We have no future because the present is too volatile,\" observes one character. \"We have only risk management. The spinning of a given moment's scenarios. Pattern recognition.\" But how do we tell the difference between pattern and coincidence? Is pattern recognition enabling or constraining? What kind of patterns emerge in a novel about digital art, Web memes, global capital, viral marketing, a postmodern advertising agency, cool hunters, and collectors of antiquarian computing equipment in settings from London to Tokyo to Moscow to post-9/11 New York? Our discussion will be the basis for three additional Digital Dialogues, to be held at intervals throughout the semester, each of which will explore the general theme of \"pattern recognition\"–a heuristic for much of MITH's current research–in varied contexts.\n",

        "talk title": "Pattern Recognition: Research at MITH",
        "description": "In our last Digital Dialogue of the semester, MITH's directors share some of their own digital humanities research in progress. The specific projects and applications to be discussed are entitled nora, White Rabbit, and Indra. All manifest a general theme of pattern recognition, and a more detailed description of each is available below. Please join us, and watch for our spring semester schedule soon. \nThe goal of the nora project is to produce software for discovering, visualizing, and exploring significant patterns across large collections of full-text humanities resources in existing digital libraries. In search-and-retrieval, we bring specific queries to collections of text and get back (more or less useful) answers to those queries; by contrast, the goal of data-mining (including text-mining) is to produce new knowledge by exposing unanticipated similarities or differences, clustering or dispersal, co-occurrence and trends. Over the last decade, many millions of dollars have been invested in creating digital library collections: at this point, terabytes of full-text humanities resources are publicly available on the web. Those collections, dispersed across many different institutions, are large enough and rich enough to provide an excellent opportunity for text-mining, and we believe that web-based text-mining tools will make those collections significantly more useful, more informative, and more rewarding for research and teaching. \nnora (which either refers to a character in a William Gibson novel, or is an acronym for \"No One Remembers Acronyms,\" depending on who in the project you ask), is a two-year project funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. The project began last October, so we're about one year in. It is multi-institutional (there are researchers at five universities) and multi-disciplinary (our group includes literary subject experts, computer scientists, library and information science). At Maryland, MITH has partnered with the Human Computer Interaction Lab for the visualization work. \nWhite Rabbit is a non-hierarchical, stand-off markup platform suitable for storing, manipulating, and delivering texts using a variety of overlapping markup schemas. It leverages the searching and sorting power of a SQL database engine while delivering robust and expandable textual markup for both display and web-service accessibility. White Rabbit's tokenized storage system makes it possible to provide an infinite set of related or independent markup schemas for the same corrected text. For example, using White Rabbit it is possible for multiple users, such as students, to markup the same text independently, or for a single user to describe the same text using multiple markup systems, such as, for example, TEI, HTML, or any form of SGML. Additionally, White Rabbit will perform a statistical analysis of the similarities and differences between multiple markups to the same text, providing a scholarly picture of the ways in which multiple users view the structure of the text. Because White Rabbit is driven by a SQL database engine, the platform also offers powerful and robust searching capability. Using White Rabbit, it is possible for any user with a standard web browser to perform complete XML searching and browsing of resource. A user working with a collection of poems could, for example, search for all occurrences of the word \"love\" that appears in the refrain of a stanza. No special browser or applications are needed to expose and utilize the full depth of a resources XML coding, because the XML parsing and searching is performed server-side by White Rabbit. \nIndra allows users to easily create RDF files for any web-accessible resource regardless of its markup platform. Enter or browse to a URL and Indra performs a semantic analysis of the resource's content and generates an RDF file based upon the Jena RDF API. Users specify link-depth penetration at runtime for each root URL. The current version of the software, which is scheduled for release in December, 2005, generates one RDF file per root URL. Future versions will perform a more robust link analysis and allow users to control the production of granular, nested RDF files. Indra is an open-source, java application that is being developed as part of the Networked Interface for Nineteenth-Century Electronic Scholarship (NINES) project.\n",

Individual users can access computing resources transparently, without having to consider where those facilities are located. Applications also include multi-disciplinary collaboration at a distance. However, the vision of large scale resource sharing is not yet a reality in many areas. \nProfessor Michael Cummings, UM's Center for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, is overseeing UM's own Grid system, The Lattice project. He will help us gain a better understanding of the functionality and benefits of Grid computing and facilitate a brainstorming session as we seek to identify challenges in the humanities that might be addressed by this capability.\n",

        "description": "The standard idea of code aesthetics, when such an idea manifests itself at all, allows for programmers to have elegance and clarity as their standards. This talk explores programming practices in which other values are at work, showing that the aesthetics of code must be enlarged to accommodate them. The two practices considered are obfuscated programming and the creation of \"weird languages\" for coding. Connections between these two practices, and between these and other mechanical and literary aesthetic traditions, are discussed. (This is a presentation of joint work with Michael Mateas.)\n",

        "description": "Scholars in history (as well as other fields in the humanities) have generally taken a dim view of the state of knowledge on the Web, pointing to the many inaccuracies on Web pages written by amateurs. A new software agent called H-Bot scans the Web for historical facts, and shows how the Web may indeed include many such inaccuracies--while at the same time being extremely accurate when assessed as a whole through statistics and algorithms that are alien to the discipline of history. These mathematical methods and other methods drawn from the computational sciences offer the possibility of new techniques for historical research in an age in which an increasingly significant portion of the past has been digitized. Professors Rosenzweig and Cohen will offer a short overview of their findings before we open the room for general discussion. The paper on which their remarks will be based is [available here](http://www.dancohen.org/writings/webofliescohenrosenzweig.pdf).\n",

        "description": "\"'American Memory' Re-Imagined\" is a demonstration project to present items from the Library of Congress's [American Memory Historical Collections](http://memory.loc.gov) in alternative formats that expand their potential uses for digital scholarship and education. The Library, as it has worked to digitize a vast and rich array of primary materials for ever expanding audiences, has not yet had the luxury to consider scholarly enhancements that move beyond mere access. In particular, LC is only beginning to explore the full potential of XML markup–together with creative use of relational databases or similar back-end programming–as an enhancement to research, interpretation, and educational use of its digitized materials. Custom tags within a document might, for example, flag correspondence to LC subject terms, or allow users to sort the contents of a document by theme or topic–that is, to manipulate documents based on conceptual categories that can't be retrieved using conventional search strings. \nIn this presentation we will consider three alternatives for the XML markup of a single digitized source, the Civil War diaries of Horatio Nelson Taft, currently presented on the Web [here](http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/tafthtml/tafthome.html). While exploring the characteristics of these three markup schemes, which we have termed \"cultural,\" \"literary,\" and \"library,\" respectively, we raise both practical and theoretical questions. How do we decide what it is we're marking? How much markup is too much? Where does markup end and pure interpretation begin? Can we please every audience at once? These questions provide an opportunity to exchange insights at the early stages of a project designed to push the boundaries of humanities research with the innovative tools of new technology.\n",

        "description": "As users annotate printed documents and gather notes they create a rich web of annotations and cross references. Unfortunately, as paper is a static media, this web often gets trapped in the physical world. \nTo address these limitations, we propose PapierCraft, a gesture-based interface that allows users to manipulate digital documents directly using their printouts as proxies. Using a digital pen, users can annotate a printout or draw command gestures to indicate operations such as copying a document area, pasting an area previously copied, or creating a link. Upon pen synchronization, our infrastructure executes these commands and presents the result in a customized viewer. In this talk I will describe the design and implementation of the PapierCraft command system, and report on early user feedback.\n",

This is performed via pixelated minstrelsy by depicting Black and Brown bodies as objects to be destroyed and women as bodies to be dominated. The mediated story of Black characters is limited and situated within buffoonery (comedy) or crime and gaming is not exempt. Media outlets have created essentialist notions about Blackness and what it means to have an ‘authentic’ Black experience. And because there are limited counter-narratives, this singular story only confirms hegemonic notions of what it means to be Black.\n",

        "description": "The Hill Museum & Manuscript Library (HMML) at Saint John’s University, Collegeville, Minnesota, was founded in 1965 to microfilm Benedictine libraries in Europe. The project grew rapidly beyond its monastic and European focus. In 2003, HMML began to use digital imaging technologies to document the manuscript heritage of ancient Christian communities in the Middle East. Starting in Lebanon, the project soon moved into Syria, Turkey, Iraq, the Old City of Jerusalem, and followed the historical progress of Mesopotamian Christianity as far as South India. HMML’s pioneering microfilming efforts in Ethiopia in the 1970s were resumed in a series of projects that included the Abba Garima Gospels, the oldest known Ethiopic manuscripts, and a first venture into Islamic manuscript digitization in Harar, an historic center of Ethiopian Islam. That step, followed by an invitation to work with the major Muslim family libraries of Jerusalem, prepared HMML to undertake leadership in digitizing the vast collections of Islamic manuscripts rescued from Timbuktu, Mali, in 2012, just before the famous desert city was occupied by Islamist forces. In addition to the project in Mali, HMML teams and partners are currently working in Croatia, Egypt, Iraq, Jerusalem, Lebanon, Malta, Ukraine, and Yemen.\nIn this presentation, Columba Stewart will explain how a Benedictine monastery in Minnesota became involved in such a massive effort to document cultural heritage; describe the challenges of data management and workflow; and present HMML’s online environment for manuscript studies, [vHMML](http://web.archive.org/web/20200818002201/http://www.vhmml.org/), which includes a Reading Room that will ultimately offer almost 100,000 complete digitized manuscripts to scholars around the world. HMML is now partnering with the Roshan Institute on projects to digitize, describe, and share Persian manuscripts endangered by conflict and environmental challenges.\n",

        "description": "Digitization and online access are often presented as an important tool for making history, particularly those whose histories are rarely told, accessible to a broader audience. However, what happens to born-digital materials which can technically be accessed—but whose content and format may not be accessible in the contemporary media environment? In this presentation, I’ll talk more about my process working with materials from the Usenet Historical Collection to build the [Transgender Usenet Archive](https://archive.mith.umd.edu/mith-2020/gets-us-talking-cant-bad-building-transgender-usenet-archive/index.html) and conduct my own research. I’ll discuss the technical and ethical challenges I faced in building the archive, as well as how these challenges informed my own research into early use of the term “cisgender” in transgender discourse.\n",

        "description": "At a moment when public media is facing the threat of elimination from lawmakers, this presentation examines the organizational contributions made by noncommercial media research to U.S. informational history. Taking an institutional approach, this presentation looks at the infrastructural origins of public media in archival distribution practices after WWII.\nIn 1948 educational broadcasters were already 27 years into the first national media advocacy to create a system of universal access to public education. Due to inconsistent broadcast practices and lack of a profit model, advocates began to aggregate key quality programming from university stations at the University of Illinois under the moniker the National Association of Educational Broadcasters.\nThe result was the creation of a decentralized “Bicycle Network” built around archival management and distribution. The proto-metadata descriptions developed by the NAEB had the result of both coding and consolidating the characteristics of genres now associated with public broadcasting and cable television. In addition, quantitative audience research into the pedagogical effectiveness of each new genre led to the construction of the first academic Communication departments, beginning in 1948.\n",

        "description": "Library and information science (LIS) has a dual history; as a profession that is over 80% white and female, the LIS workforce has been plagued with segregation and a lack of representation. However, LIS also has many amazing stories, stories of people of color changing the profession and the lives of their patrons. It is imperative that these stories be unearthed, to celebrate our success stories, but to also learn from our mistakes.\nThis talk will discuss examples of segregation in LIS, specifically highlighting The Carnegie Scholars who were a group of 30 graduate students of who attended the University of Illinois after the Civil Rights Movement and the Brown vs. Board of Education decision. Discussion will then turn to the difficulties of conducting this type of research and the challenges that come with trying to unearth both good and bad episodes of LIS history.\n",

The multi-media and trans-platform nature of such publics provide users with a range of affordances that allow them to oscillate the public between functioning as an enclave or as a counter-public. This talk discusses a network of Black American content creators and social media users to explore how such oscillation, between enclave and counter-public, occurs as participants move between platforms in the network and exploit, or work around, the affordances each offers.\n",

        "talk title": "The Bicentennial Frankenstein Project",
        "description": "In this talk, I will introduce the collaboration of the Pittsburgh Bicentennial Frankenstein team with MITH to produce a new and authoritative digital edition of the 1818, 1823, and 1831 published texts of _Frankenstein_ linked with the Shelley-Godwin Archive edition of Mary Shelley’s manuscript notebooks. We have been hard at work on the project since fall, and aim to complete the project by May 2018, the bicentennial of the novel’s first publication.\nPreparing the edition has given us a fascinating vantage point on early work with 1990’s hypertext, as we began our work by up-converting hundreds of “hypercard” files in Stuart Curran and Jack Lynch’s [Pennsylvania Electronic Edition](http://knarf.english.upenn.edu/) of _Frankenstein_. That hypertext edition represented groundbreaking digital scholarship in the era of web 1.0, by deploying an interface for reading the 1818 and 1831 texts in juxtaposed parallel texts. Our work on the project has involved polishing and repurposing the code of Curran’s and Lynch’s electronic editions of the 1818 and 1831 texts. With help from Rikk Mulligan, Digital Scholarship librarian at Carnegie Mellon University, we have been correcting our restored text against photo facsimiles of the originals, and we have prepared plain text and simple XML editions from OCR of the 1823 edition, derived via ABBYY Finereader, and formatted like our editions of the 1818 and 1823. We have been preparing a new edition in TEI by first processing these documents with [CollateX](http://collatex.net/), which computationally locates the points of variance (or “deltas”) among the editions and outputs these as a single critical edition with TEI XML critical apparatus markup.\nCollating the print editions establishes a basis for one last and especially challenging stage of our project. We are now working with Raffaele Viglianti to integrate the Shelley-Godwin Archive’s manuscript notebook drafts of _Frankenstein_ with our critical edition of the published novels. For this we are planning a new implementation of TEI critical apparatus markup to point to specific locations in the manuscript notebooks. This will provide a way to link a reading interface of the novel that highlights “hotspots” of variance in the print edition and that links into relevant passages in the Notebooks.\nWe will be offering our bicentennial edition to update the one currently hosted by Romantic Circles. Our new edition’s reading interface should invite readers to learn the interesting story of how the events and characters of the novel changed over the first decades of its life, from the time of its first drafts by its 18-year-old author to the changes imposed by authors and editors over three published editions from 1818, 1823, and 1831. We hope our edition will inspire fresh investigations of longstanding questions about _Frankenstein_’s transformations, such as the extent of Godwin’s interventions in the text in 1823 and how many of these these persist in the 1831 text. This dialogue offers a chance to share views of the new TEI edition underway, and invites reflection and discussion of our textual methods in stitching together our new textual “monster.”\n",

Alexandrina Agloro, media artist and assistant professor, will discuss the landscape of design and digital humanities projects geared toward social change, and share some of her current projects. Each of these projects incorporate pieces of reimagining archives, culturally relevant education, game development, and tools for reproductive justice. These projects were developed through a participatory design methodology and model how we think about organizing and implementing activism. The second part of this talk will turn to community-engaged game development and discuss two games, _The Resisters_, an alternate reality game about social movement history, and _Vukuzenzele_, a videogame about reblocking informal settlements in South Africa. These games are examples of the opportunities and challenges in applied game design and how game mechanics can be utilized as instruments for engagement and action.\n",

        "description": "This talk will speculate on the following questions: to what extent and in what ways might communities use archives as avenues to abolish police and prisons in the United States? How can archivists, organizers, and resource allocators use the archive as a means and a method to envision a world without police and prisons, thereby assisting in the construction of a society that relies on new sets of relationships to promote justice? Drawing on historical research and narratives from [A People’s Archive of Police Violence in Cleveland](http://www.archivingpoliceviolence.org/), Jarrett Drake will explore the term ‘abolitionist archives’ and describe how they constitute a critical component to the constellation of alternatives to imagine a societal landscape free from our present punishment paradigm.\n",

        "talk title": "Persian Twitter",
        "description": "Social media have transformed our societies and contributed to creation of online public spaces. In the past few years, we witnessed how social media were central to any debate of socio-political movements around the world. Social media were cited as the new catalysts of social change in these contexts. However, still controversies exist about the role they played in these movements. Studying these online spaces becomes a challenge considering the pressure of repressive cultural environments. In such environments, accessing users freely is not possible in most cases. Moreover, the scale and complexity of data requires employing multiple methods to achieve a more nuanced understanding of online publics. To overcome these challenges and to gain a better understanding of the dynamics of the online public environments in Iran, Khazraee started a project for the Cartography of Iran’s online publics. The goal of the project is collecting empirical evidence that helps us to achieve a high resolution image of public online environments in Iran. As part of this project, he has conducted research on Twitter use among Iranians during two presidential elections in Iran in 2013 and 2017. This study aims to map the political landscape of Persian Twitter between these two elections and to investigate how it has been transformed during this period. The study, also, reveals the transformation of power structure in Persian Twitter between the two elections, as well as the role of various political communities and their influence on the larger communication network.\n",

        "talk title": "Art and Architectural History and the Performative, Mindful Practice of the Digital Humanities",
        "description": "Since the early days of the field, art and architectural historians have relied on image-based reproductions of our primary source material to do our work. And yet, Photography and digitization—the two main image-reproduction technologies of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries—do not duplicate their subjects uncritically. They have actively shaped our disciplines in sometimes overt, sometimes covert, ways. That said, photography and digitization are also different technologies from one another, and their use has been implemented fitfully and heterogeneously over time within the field. Art and architectural historians have thus not only become familiar with the process of embedding technologies into the humanities, we have also gathered hard-won, field-wide experience with the impact that their presence and obsolescence can have on our research processes over time. The story is not always one of success. We have often chosen to elide, ignore, or take for granted the ways that the socio-technical environments of these remediations have transformed the daily operations and rituals of our discipline. Because of this time-tested relationship, I wish to argue that art and architectural history offers the Digital Humanities approximately 115 years of experience with being attuned (or not attuned) to the impact of relying on technologically-mediated representations of the phenomenal world to perform humanities research. This type of scholarship, that is, one not directly reliant on primary sources but instead on remediations of those sources, is the fundamental, originary condition of the Digital Humanities.\n",

        "description": "In the fall of 2017, Philadelphia was the site of 20 temporary monuments created by local and international artists across 10 public parks as part of a citywide art and history project curated by Paul Farber and Ken Lum, and produced in partnership with Mural Arts Philadelphia. These included an afro pick embedded on the Municipal Services Plaza, a performance in a public park, a mirrored box surrounding an old monument such that it simultaneously disappeared into its surroundings and reflected the people in the park and many others. In each of 10 public squares and parks, a small, temporary lab was staffed at least 4 days a week to invite Philadelphians and visitors to reflect on our city’s monuments. They were handed a clipboard and asked to engage with the central guiding question of Monument Lab: What is an appropriate monument for the current city of Philadelphia? Nearly 5000 people offered proposals in answer to that question, and each of their answers has been transcribed, analyzed, including a drawing or description, proposers’ home zip codes, proposers’ ages, and the place in the city where they’d like to see their imagined monuments. This dataset, comprising an imagined version of the city’s monumental landscape will be focus of a conversation about the intersections between the stories that are told in our public monuments and in our data, and the individual stories that are lost and hidden.\n",

        "description": "This presentation discusses the conceptualization and development of interactive cartographic platform _In the Same Boats: Toward an Intellectual Cartography of the Afro-Atlantic_. _In the Same Boats_ is a work of multimodal scholarship designed to encourage the collaborative production of humanistic knowledge within scholarly communities. Comprising two interactive visualizations that trace the movements of seminal cultural actors from the Caribbean and wider Americas, Africa, and Europe within the twentieth century Afro-Atlantic world, the platform seeks to push back against the ways in which “Global South” intellectual production has been stubbornly balkanized in the academy, its limits and contours largely determined by imperial metropoles. The project charts the extent to which Caribbean, African, Latin American, European, and Afro-American intellectuals have had opportunities to be in both punctual and sustained conversation with one another: attending the same conferences, publishing in the same journals and presses, active in the same political groups, perhaps even elbow-to-elbow in the same Parisian cafés and on the same transatlantic crossings – literally and metaphorically in the same boats – as they circulate throughout the Americas, Africa, Europe, and beyond. Leveraging the affordances of digital technology to facilitate a literal retracing of hemispheric black studies, the project draws attention to multiple sites of potentially interconnected Afro-Atlantic theoretical and creative production. Easily accessible, visually impactful, and content-rich, the combination of these two visualizations proposes a generative resource for twenty-first century scholarship concerning the long-historical impact of Afro-Atlantic figures across a vast networked geo-cultural space.\n",

        "description": "How can we construct a literary history of recorded poetry that recognizes media as an intrinsic dimension of the poems’ forms? Given the longtime understanding of the recorded poem as, at best, a simulacrum of a primary, written text (if not of the live performance, too—a copy of a copy), poetry recordings have not received the same kind of material and media archaeological study as their textual counterparts. Through a precis of the PennSound archive, the world’s largest archive of recorded poetry and the archival response to Charles Bernstein’s call for scholarly attention to the performed poem, this talk suggests what such a literary history of poetry audio might look like. We will examine various periods of sound recording history, starting with late nineteenth-century European work to create _Stimmporträts_, or portraits of voices, through American record companies’ attempts to grapple with the political-economy of sounded verse. If there is a center and a periphery of our sonic memory, attention will need to be paid to oppositional archives and their use of media to subvert systems of dominance by seizing the media of production. Examples of the various kinds of archives under consideration will include: experimental French phonetics labs of the early 20th century; Columbia University’s Speech Lab Recordings, scored to aluminum records in the 1930s and ‘40s; and so-called Soviet bone records, samizdat records cut into discarded x-ray films. We will conclude on the question of what new affordances become possible when grooves become bits and the temporality of discs gives way to the logic of disks. By looking at the newest digital humanities research in distant listening and media archaeology, we will see that the digitized forms of previously recorded poems are not just copies of copies, but generative of new possibilities. \n",

        "description": "This session will include presentations on projects in three very different cultural and social contexts. The purpose of the session is to prompt and facilitate discussion around issues that arise in using digital tools and techniques to support and preserve cultural memory. Each project is nationally important in its own context, but each may also be seen as a ‘type’.\n#### [The Julfa cemetery digital repatriation project: countering cultural genocide through technology](https://julfaproject.wordpress.com/) \nThe ancient cemetery at Julfa was perhaps the oldest Christian cemetery. It lies in Nakhichevan, for centuries part of Armenia, but since the 1920s part of Azerbaijan. After several decades of neglect, the cemetery was completely demolished in 2006 by the Azerbaijan army. The cemetery was of immense significance in Armenian religion and culture, and thanks to an archive of 4,000 photographs plus a great deal of additional evidence, a project, based at Australian Catholic University, is under way to create a sophisticated virtual reconstruction of the cemetery, with the purpose of ‘repatriating’ this important cultural heritage to Armenians not only in Armenia but in the many diasporas around the world.\n#### [The Journey to Horseshoe Bend Project](http://pubsites.uws.edu.au/coa/soca/jthb/index.html) \nThis project, along with a number of successor or related projects, is based at Western Sydney University and the Strehlow Research Centre in Alice Springs. It holds the materials created and collected by the renowned Australian anthropologist T G H Strehlow, who spent his life among the Arrernte people of Central Australia (alternative spellings include: Arrente, Aranda, Arrarnta). The projects aim to encourage Indigenous and non-Indigenous involvement with Australian historical and cultural knowledge, and to build capacity for users to engage in digital story telling, e-learning and interaction with archival materials.\n#### [North-West University, South Africa: The Centre for Text Technology (CTexT)](http://www.nwu.ac.za/ctext) \nThe importance of the work done by this group lies in the fact that South Africa has 11 official languages, most of which are ‘resource-poor’ – i.e. they have few or no digital resources or tools available. The Centre for Text Technology (CTexT®) is a research and development centre at the Potchefstroom Campus of the North-West University. The Centre does research on human language technology and develops language technology products for the official South African languages. As a result of its pioneering work over a number of years, it was recently appointed to host and develop the national Language Resource Management Agency.\n",

        "description": "Staking a claim in collaborative models of digital archiving, exhibition and geo-spatial visualization, Sarah Patterson and Jim Casey will introduce questions, concepts and outcomes central to the Colored Conventions Project’s online restoration of the Colored Conventions Movement, 1830-1900. Working with literature and data connected to this understudied phenomenon in Black political organizing, Patterson and Casey will discuss the ways CCP’s interdisciplinary team produces narrative-centric exhibits and interactive visualizations for multiple learning communities. This presentation will especially chart CCP’s interest in tackling key questions on its journey to creating DH content for those interested in social justice pedagogies and collaborative knowledge production.\nQuestions of focus will include: How do we better grasp women’s instrumentality through mapping technologies that magnify their activities within historical spaces connected to the movement? How do social network analyses contribute to our understanding of Black convention leadership? In what ways do concepts of power and authority impact computing and technology-selection as the project emerges within a broader landscape of Black histo-digital studies? We seek to highlight DH praxis and pedagogies to enhance what scholarly and public audiences know about the debates, people, places and texts related to the seven-decades-long campaign for Black rights.\n",

I will begin this talk with a brief description of the history of this work at Brown, including the NEH-sponsored project to create an on-line scholarly community for a poetry course in 1976, and the ways in which a recent system, Touch Art Gallery, is being used by courses at Brown, the Nobel Foundation and the Massachusetts Historical Society. Then I will shift to the main focus, a live demo of an early version of the latest multi-format hypermedia system my group is building to support information gathering, sense-making (including organizing, annotating, relationship-building through linking, grouping and visualizations), and ultimately presenting multimedia information. We are especially interested in supporting small workgroup collaboration and the use of pen- and touch-computing on tablets and large interactive whiteboards.\n",

        "description": "In the _Republic of the Imagination_, Azar Nafisi champions reading as a way to open ourselves to deepen empathy and entice our curiosity. Inspired, I am developing ways of documenting and visualizing not only what I read, but also what caused me to read using linked open data. Through a custom Jekyll plugin, RDFa triples are extracted from my reading notes text files. The plugin writes JSON-LD triplets, which are then used as input for a variety of visualizations.\nTracing reading reveals the breadths and depths of interconnected themes among works that, initially, are connected simply because I noticed one influenced me to read the other. The visualizations enable movement between big-picture views of the corpus and close-readings of individual books and can reveal adjacent possibilities in themes, readings, as well as shape questions that may be currently unarticulated.\nInfluenced by feminist interface design, this talk will focus on the design and creation of visualizations – as finding aids, as maps into the landscape of a personal corpus. \n",

        "description": "This talk describes the discovery and significance of _Etude_ (1967), a previously unknown work by media artist Nam June Paik identified by the author in the Smithsonian American Art Museum’s recently-acquired Paik archive. Composed at Bell Labs, in collaboration with engineers, and written in an early version of FORTRAN, _Etude_ stands as one of the earliest works of digital art_—_although it is not entirely clear whether _Etude_ was, in fact, the “computer opera” that Paik mentions elsewhere in his writings, or another artwork altogether. By exploring _Etude_’s uncertain status, as well as the piece’s more conceptual indeterminacies—between image and code, analog and digital, and film and music—this paper demonstrates how such indefinite artifacts allow for a rethinking of the nature of the archive, cinema’s digital past, and film’s place in computational media.\n",

        "description": "Could a Spotify playlist be considered an archive? How do hashtags challenge our finding aids of certain communities? Social and digital media tools and platforms have increasingly been utilized to advance community-centered approaches to archives, collections, and interpretation. These methods decolonize the archival practice and assert the presence of marginalized communities. This challenge comes as critiques such as [#archivessowhite](https://twitter.com/hashtag/archivessowhite) and [#museumsrespondtoferguson](https://twitter.com/hashtag/museumsrespondtoferguson?src=hash) have been pushed by professionals of color from within the field. This talk is a theoretical and practical exploration of what I call 'radical archives' to expand the intersections of race, gender, ethnicity, and identity. How do we as GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums) professionals, educators, and scholars learn from this engagement toward greater intersectionality in our interpretations? How do these radical archives bridge GLAM institutions? These social and digital media tools and platforms are utilized to interact with the archive that are not legible to the institution and confront perceptions of cultural fluency.\n",

        "description": "Books are primarily physical objects composed of leaves combined in sections, used as writing supports, and bound together. An increasing number of libraries, archives, and other memory institutions are investing considerable amount of money and resources in the digitization of cultural heritage; however, these efforts focus on the text, seldom covering also what material information can be recorded through photographic means. In addition, conservation is commonly considered as a discipline that is complementary—but for the most part separate—to digitization efforts, and little attention is generally given to the ways in which digitization, intended in its amplest meaning, can inform and help conservators in their day-to-day duties.\nSpecialized digitization efforts, such as multispectral imaging, can help us glean a considerable amount of information on the materiality of our documentary cultural heritage, allowing us to see what would otherwise be invisible to us. This information, beyond recovering the deleted texts from palimpsest membranes, can prove invaluable to conservators and their understanding of the object without interfering with its integrity. Data gathered in this manner, for example, informs conservation treatment procedures and decisions regarding the amount of light exposure a document can ‘safely’ handle \nThere has been considerable research on individual components—such as paper, parchment, decoration—but only little attention has traditionally been given to the book as a composite artefact. Bookbinding structures are recognised as an important source of information on the material context of books and their material culture, however, analysis in this field is still rather under-developed and tentative, mostly because limited efforts have been made so far to establish standardized analysis methodology and terminology, and to include structural information within databases to build large enough bookbinding datasets. As a product of my doctoral research I have developed an automated visualization tool producing schematic diagrams of bookbinding structures. This tool mimics the kind of drawings conservators often sketch to better understand and communicate the objects they work with, and can help recording data on the material formation of books, and communicating it with the community of scholars, other conservators, and the general public. In turn, the automated drawings can also be used as a visual data proofing tool, and as a way to test the effectiveness of description schemas. \nThis seminar will showcase, through some practical examples, the ways in which data gathered through digitization means can prove meaningful and useful to conservation professionals. \n",

        "talk title": "Looking for the Perfect Beat",
        "description": "Patterns in literary scholarship suggest that serious considerations of a literary period do not fully begin until at least a generation after its emergence. Accordingly, meaningful scholarship on African American literature since 1970 is only now beginning to slowly emerge. Scholars interested in this period face two significant challenges. First, the sheer volume of literature published after 1970 can be overwhelming, so identifying a specialty area around which to acquire deep expertise is at once critical and limiting. Second, since literary periods are themselves often nebulously constructed, developing literary histories for a contemporary period can quickly dissolve into competing contrivances, particularly if/when primary source material to document many of its ideals and common threads prove elusive.\nArguably, the clash of too much written material to claim mastery of and too little awareness of primary resources related to the desired specialty area has resulted in an unnecessary muting of key discourses that shaped this highly influential period. Digital Humanities practices, however, can help manage this challenge, thereby giving voice to these key discourses. Ultimately, Williams and Rambsy contend that data management (technology) can be an essential tool for constructing a substantive literary history with a texture reflective of the period’s ripe content and contexts. As a case in point, the presentation focuses specifically on those texts Toni Morrison brought into print as Senior Editor at Random House Publishing Company as the specialty area around which the presenters have significant expertise and for which a singularly unique literary history can be constructed.\n",

        "description": "A heartrending recent development of digital practice is the dissemination on social networks of videos of state violence against Black men and women, such as the Facebook video of Philando Castile’s passing, or the YouTube video depicting the arrest and beating of Sandra Bland. In response, many Black folk have begun describing the effects these videos and shares have upon them, a phenomenon that can be understood as [racial battle fatigue](http://www.academia.edu/1756366/Challenging_Racial_Battle_Fatigue_on_Historically_White_Campuses_A_Critical_Race_Examination_of_Race-Related_Stress_William_A._Smith_Tara_J._Yosso_and_Daniel_G._Solorzano._Book_Chapter_2006_Reprinted_2011).\nThis presentation, in the mode of critical digital humanities, addresses how social and digital media mediates and manifests the ‘[peculiar social environment](http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095736688)’ of White racial ideology. One egregious example can be found in [Lisa Nakamura’s 2013 essay](http://culturedigitally.org/2013/12/glitch-racism-networks-as-actors-within-vernacular-internet-theory/) describing how White racial ideology configures internet beliefs and discourses to portray racist digital practice as a “glitch.”\nWhite racial ideology (“whiteness”) in online spaces is not always explicit, however. It takes many paths toward coercion and hegemony; I speculate here upon algorithmically-driven social media “feeds,” rather than individuals, enacting racist digital practice. This practice, which I argue for here as “weak tie racism,” becomes apparent in its engendering of the Black digital practice of reflexivity. This reflexivity, presented as cultural digital practice, is often expressed as spiritual, emotional, and physical engagement with online racism. Taken together, weak tie racism and Black online reflexivity can be understood as a dialectic of cultural digital practices that should be considered a norm, rather than a glitch.\n",

In this talk I use this distinction as a framework for critical reflection on engaging how past agents marginalized in history have influenced the meaning of space and place. My focus will center on enslaved people who liberated themselves from bondage in the Great Dismal Swamp borderlands area of Virginia and North Carolina. Throughout this talk I will discuss how geospatial analysis has broadened the ways I approach enslaved movement in cartographies of struggle by pointing out the literal and figurative connections to space that enslaved people recognized in their journeys toward making freedom. The human costs associated with running away like distance, navigational literacy, and access to shelter and food are all weighed in this conversation. Ultimately the goal of this talk is to expand our understanding of how geospatial processes intervene with investigations into slavery and freedom and inform how enslaved movement translates spaces of the past.\n",

        "description": "> Revolutionary dreams erupt out of political engagement; collective social movements are incubators of new knowledge. _-- _Robin D.G. Kelly, _Freedom Dreams: The Black Radical Imagination _\nThis presentation traces the arc of Museums Respond to Ferguson and #BlkTwitterstorians–two born digital projects that emerged at the height of the Movement for Black Lives. The chats started with queries that then influenced deeper dialogue on how scholars and activists together could use history to inform a world specifically void of policing and incarceration. Both projects hinged on collective engagement with a few questions (and critiques) to incubate new ideas on how to present and preserve Black history with Black futures in mind. While both projects happened online, low-tech methodologies deeply informed project decisions. Phone calls, in-person meetings and printed chats played an important role in shaping the project. There was a heavy emphasis on the public, but the projects influenced the personal in ways that ultimately led to Museums Respond to Ferguson’s end and #BlkTwitterstorians refocus. \nThis presentation will also include a demonstration, inviting participants to walk through constructing a dialogue on Twitter: preparation, rules for engagement, reflecting, and planning for archiving and dissemination. \n",

Researchers across a variety of fields have recognized this and have begun to study how digital environments enable and sometimes even prop up bad actors. This presentation examines some of the historical underpinnings of what Brown calls “hateware,” computational environments that employ policies, algorithms, and designs that enable, actively encourage, and sometimes even directly participate in abuse or harassment. He turns to a previous technology, the telephone, in order to better understand the intertwined histories of harassment and technological infrastructure.\n",

        "description": "Archives and Digital Humanities (DH) projects that showcase minority voices can disrupt the mainstream perceptions of history and the literary canon; yet all too often, large-scale DH projects and archives reinforce Western epistemology and ontology. In response, some postcolonial and feminist scholars have approached DH from the margins of cultural and political life in order to encourage DH scholars to create and adopt methodologies that engage decolonial theory. Such methodologies consider how digital scholarship frames knowledge and knowledge-production. While national archives help to structure knowledge through a state-sanctioned narrative, decolonial DH methodologies seek to address the silences not only in digital scholarship, but also in the official archive.\nDrawing on Women of Color (WOC) theory such as Chela Sandoval’s _Methodology of the Oppressed_ (2000), I discuss the digital implications and applications of “oppositional consciousness” and Affect theory. In this talk, I focus on the emerging US Latina/o Digital Humanities initiative at the Recovering the US Hispanic Literary Heritage project (aka “Recovery”) in order to examine structural colonial problems encountered in US Latina/o DH and the stakes of digital decolonial praxis.\n",

        "description": "We in digital humanities and media studies like to use environmental metaphors. We talk of “media ecologies” and hold conferences about “possible worlds.” Maxwell, Raundalen, and Vestberg have suggested that such metaphors of the environment obscure the relationship of digital media to the material world, enabling utopian discussions about virtual environments at the precise moment in which the real environment is in crisis. The emerging field of Ecocritical DH (EcoDH) seeks to maintain a focus on the material world within the digital humanities. Located at the nexus of environmental humanities and digital humanities, EcoDH mobilizes a range of tools and critical constructs, using digital methods to investigate environmental issues while reflecting on the ecological implications of those same digital methods. EcoDH thus offers new horizons for digital work while challenging digital humanities to investigate its own practices and metaphors.\nOur panel features scholars and practitioners from various institutions and backgrounds discussing the existing place of, and future possibilities for, EcoDH. Ted Dawson will present on immersive experiences of infrastructure and how these can both reveal and obscure the materiality of the digital. Amanda Starling Gould will touch upon the “dirty digital humanities,” sustainable digital practice through permaculture, and the urgency of cross-disciplinary EcoDH. Craig Dietrich will discuss his work combining permaculture with network culture by creating software that drives non-hierarchical systems such as Scalar and ThoughtMesh. Max Symuleski will explore the political ecology of maintenance as it relates to digital objects, digital infrastructures, and life-cycles of computational hardware. libi will address media archaeological and techno-revitalization practices in relation to obsolescence and convenience culture.\nTo demonstrate EcoDH at its best, our presentation will be a hybrid intervention that puts into practice our theoretical intentions.\n",

        "talk title": "The Sound of Public Humanities and its Oscillatory Accessibility",
        "description": "In 1913, Robert Frost declared his aim to “be a poet for all sorts and kinds.” By and large, Frost remains one of the beloved American poets, who many of us encounter in K-12 education and in anthologies around the world. Indeed, Frost’s ur-mission statement has driven my own efforts to develop an open-access public platform for his 21st-century audiences through critical collaboration with Frost scholars, special collections librarians, Frost family members and friends, as well as the poet’s literary estate.\nA closer look at reception histories of the sound of Frost’s poetry, however, sheds light on the exploit around the notion of Frost’s perceived accessibility. Early in his career, Frost envisioned of becoming a popular poet—rather than elitist—by writing in vernacular language and focusing on what he believed was universal: emotional truths reflected in the tone of speech. Frost’s effort to communicate the eloquence of the vernacular, however, was not immediately successful because of existing biases against the setting of his poetry: rural New England. His contemporary literary critics characterized Frost’s diction in pathologized terms and credited him—as far as critics’ understanding went—for rightly capturing the village-speak, a testimony to a backward and unsophisticated region. Paradoxically enough, later in his career, the same sound of poetry lent itself to a xenophobic, remedial speech science as elocutionists upheld it as the ideal standard American English that Chinese immigrant students should study. While Frost had initially been comfortable with, lenient enough with, or even benefitted from his critics and those teachers who taught his work projecting what they wished his works to sound like, such misapprehensions were consequential to groups of people who were historically on the receiving end of prejudices against their accents, regional dialects, and the tone of voice critics and teachers loved to hate.\n“The Sound of Public Humanities and its Oscillatory Accessibility” details my editorial efforts to historicize our listening practices and to mitigate reproduction of such historical biases against class, race, abilities, and national origin seen in Frost’s reception histories. Additionally, and in anticipation of digitally enabled sound analyses the online audio edition of Frost’s public performances may spur, I will share my precautions and curatorial resistance against the inherently reductive computational text analysis procedures. I ask to what end a certain level of abstraction—another mode of exploit enabled by technical accessibility—might be warranted in exchange for larger statistical insights, especially when the socio-historical contexts of Frost’s sound of poetry speak volumes about the kinds of violence limiting interpretations can enact.\n",

Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr to a fuller and more complex understanding of the entire year. Through deep dives in numerous archives and the curation of 365 #OTD stories and photographs in 2018, the dc 1968 project illumines how _loud_ 1968 archives actually are, how white-owned media outlets like the _Washington Post_ and the _Washingtonian_ magazine _silence_ their own archives, and how archives are also _quiet_, providing evidence of joy and mobility in the city.\n",

All of them rely our human capacity for managing fine detail as much as or more than they rely on technological infrastructure. Although Digital Humanities often tends to focus on the macroscopic, with text mining, visualization, and distant reading, it has important things to say about the small-scale too. And since in the end, most of what we do is built on a foundation of details, making digital scholarship more accessible, sustainable, inclusive, equitable, and diverse will require some attention to those details.\n",

        "description": "“Konbit” is an expression in Haitian Creole that means to work together, collaboratively, to achieve a desired outcome. Haitian Studies scholar and digital humanist Marlene L. Daut interprets “konbit” to mean not only analog but also digital collaborations. Working together with undergraduate and graduate students, independent scholars, archivists, librarians, digital humanists, historians, and literary scholars we have created and maintained A Colony in Crisis, a digital history project about colonial Haiti, for the last five years.\nThe Colony in Crisis project sprang from our desire to get digitized French revolutionary pamphlets, which had not seen much use, into the hands of undergraduate students. In consultation with Dr. Jen Guiliano, right here in MITH, we planned out a site that would serve up translated excerpts of key pamphlets, along with historical background, much like an online document reader. The site now includes 3 issues of translated pamphlets, background notes written by undergrads as a class assignment, and Haitian Creole translations, with accompanying audio.\nThis talk will discuss how the concept of “konbit” has been incorporated into our work on A Colony in Crisis, specifically in our classroom interventions and collaborative working arrangements. In this presentation, we will share lessons learned and future plans on the site’s 5th anniversary and beyond.\n",

        "talk title": "Videogames, Glitches, and the Narrative of Malfunction",
        "description": "The word “glitch,” meaning a small voltage variance that can short out a circuit, entered the English language through radio hobbyists and was popularized by astronauts, for whom a glitch could mean the difference between life and death. But while the word “glitch” is often still used to connote catastrophic failure, videogamers have come to view glitches opportunistically, as chances to intervene in game texts in ways unforeseen (and often unforeseeable) by their developers. The results range from the ability to walk through walls, to new strategies for survival in unfavorable conditions, all the way to the discovery of entirely new navigable spaces outside the game’s imposed boundaries.\nMy presentation draws on a variety of game glitches and the alternate modes of textual navigation they enable to demonstrate how the glitch forces us to rethink even such basic concepts as plot, character, temporality, and point of view, ultimately showing how the resulting “narrative of malfunction” blends and reshapes digital studies, narratology, and queer/disability theory to establish brokenness, error, and failure as baseline states within which narrative “function” is at best temporary and often actively to be avoided. All texts are thus potentially glitched, and much can be learned and accomplished within them by reading for the glitches.\n",

        "description": "Due to its unique geography, Puerto Rico is at the forefront of climate catastrophe. In theory, Puerto Rico’s devastating experiences should provide nations around the world with insight into impending climate fluctuations. But as my presentation reveals, the global disaster-response methods being used by governments and contractors tend to be underpinned by power, greed, and discrimination. Most troubling, they reinforce racism and sexism—propping up the powerful, exploiting the vulnerable, and enacting state-sanctioned violence. As I will argue, governments and recovery organizations need to develop ethical responses that address the concerns of their most vulnerable citizens, rather than profiting from disaster capitalism. Based on interviews with Puerto Rican survivors of Hurricane San Felipe (1928) and Hurricane María (2017) and on archival research, this presentation highlights the devaluation of life and the increase in violence, particularly violence against women, that has wracked the island in the wake of the hurricane. Building upon the activist practices of the environmental justice movement, which seeks ethical treatment for all living beings, I offer compelling solutions to these inequities, such as the formation of disaster-specific mental health services and communally owned energy infrastructure. These mechanisms, paired with ongoing climate activism, provide opportunities for addressing post-disaster spikes in violence against the vulnerable and the marginalized.\n",

        "talk title": "Digital Containerization",
        "description": "_Containers _may be used to store information—their structures bundle together our data in discrete, lightweight, and economical units. We know that physical containers like paper Hollinger boxes fill the shelves of our libraries and archives, but digital containers used by these institutions remain far less historicized. Containers are a type of _logistical media_ (a term coined by John Durham Peters), which help us organize and orient, and to arrange people and property. In Kyle Bickoff’s presentation, he will present a history of digital storage containers—he begins with an early programmable storage medium: the punch card, following the unit’s acceleration as it is wrapped around cylindrical punch card drums to expedite the work of a human key punch operator. He then turns to the spinning surfaces of magnetic media, such as hard drives, which map new topologies onto their surfaces to arrange information efficiently and to lower latency. His argument circles to containers used in digital preservation, including the Library of Congress BagIt file structure and the open-source Matroska Multimedia Container. Finally, he addresses containers at scale, like Docker, used in the logistical movement and storage of information. In tracing this history, Kyle Bickoff follows the acceleration of containers in information systems and their role as logistical media technologies, speculating on the enduring legacy of containers in libraries and archives, and across our 21st century globally distributed networks of information communication and storage.\n",

        "description": "In Roopika Risam’s recent book New Digital Worlds (2019), she proposes that “those of us who are equipped with the capacity for humanities inquiry [and are committed to social justice] have a responsibility to intervene” in the legacies of colonialism by “creating projects to challenge the exclusions in the record of digital knowledge” (139-140). It is imperative to bring this call to action to the abundant legacy of colonialist production in regards to border and borderlands representations. It is crucial to reclaim the humanity of communities, such as the ones along the Mexico-U.S. border, by critically contextualizing and reshaping knowledge production through the use of digital methods and tools, as well as collaborative practices. Nevertheless, as a member of the border community, it is necessary to question and consider alternative ways to work with and without the institution- and university-based initiatives, that own, control and direct the material, structure and meaning of DH projects connected to personal representations and/or critical issues. Based on my experience, as cofounder of Borderlands Archive Cartography and team member of United Fronteras, I will discuss the importance of tracing, recompiling and documenting the cultural, literary and digital record of the binational-transnational area of the U.S.-Mexico border, in order to bring to the forefront the various ways in which historical realities, past and present socio-political conditions, and local experiences of this region are being imagined, showcased, studied and interpreted.\n",

        "description": "This talk undertakes a partial genealogy of breath as it has been racialized within the project of modernity. I argue that Eric Garner’s “I can’t breathe” sits amongst the larger and longer singularity of Black breath being circumscribed and suffocated, while concomitantly highlighting the struggle to resist and exist within this project. I offer up the term Black breath as a lexicon through which we can thread together new histories, theories, and philosophies of the biopolitical project of modernity in order to expand the critical grammars of the contemporary moment. Hold:Space is a criticopoetic digital project that tenders constellations between Blackness and, as, and with breathing.\nVulnerability to loss of breath has been a formative figure in the Black performative, literary, and lived tradition, one that provides if not a praxis of liberation, then a kind of radical sociality, a kind of quantum entanglement. Sojourning with that cramped suffocating cavity of the hold and the endless possibilities that breathing space conjures, I explore these two spaces as co-constitutive: Hold contends with the resonant tides of the Middle Passage and the lost breath below the kala pani; Space is a moment to tumble into possible futurities—fall into what space to breathe fully might look like.\n",

        "talk title": "Design, Development, and Documentation: Hacking TEI for Black Digital Humanities",
        "description": "The Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) is a standard of extensible markup language (XML) that prides itself upon the ability to adapt and evolve to the ever-changing needs of its users, who rely on the guidelines for scholarly modeling, analysis, and digital collections. Now in its fifth major iteration (P5), the TEI guidelines are a productive building block for Black digital humanities work. However, close attention to TEI tags, elements, and “best practices” expose how the guidelines relegate Black DH to the margins, as an addendum to or variation on scholarly markup. In this talk, we will share a framework that addresses challenges and tensions Black DH researchers—including librarians, graduate students, and independent scholars—encounter in TEI standards. This framework of critical care and codework grapples with the complexities of transforming historically de-centered voices into data, the politics of labeling the Black body using tags, and the role of encoders in interpreting and annotating Black voices. It also enkindles the design and development of a Black DH Schema for TEI.\nThe Black DH Schema is an anti-racist and anti-colonial effort to reimagine the uses and users of the TEI guidelines and move toward encoding that presumes Blackness and Black people as central to engaging text—whether in discovery, access, analysis, collection, and/or preservation. This talk will share the early progress of this project and a preliminary draft of the tag set. We will further emphasize and discuss the values and principles guiding this project in both process and product, including limning and cultivating collaboration, workflows and timelines, the importance of feminist timekeeping, and critical kindness—from design to comprehensive documentation.\n",

        "description": "Over approximately the last decade, the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI), has become a recognized international community-driven effort that has developed and maintains the MEI schema, standards, and shared documentation. The potential of machine-readable music data that can be reused, rendered, shared, or analyzed using a computer, is quite appealing, however the reality is that various barriers exist for people who may be interested in creating or using encoded music data for the first time.\nOne approach to lowering barriers is through digital pedagogy, in which the focus is “specifically on the use of technology to break down learning barriers and enhance students’ learning experiences.”(1) In addition to teaching MEI via online tutorials or workshops, students and scholars\\* should consider approaching the MEI through the lens of digital pedagogy or more specifically critical pedagogy, which emphasizes and overlaps with many of the tenets that make up the ACRL Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education.(2) Critical pedagogy encourages questions around authority and power structures, for instance: why was MEI created and for whom, whose music is being encoded, who has access to the data, when/why should we use MEI, what type of infrastructure is necessary for MEI work, and so on. Encouraging and engaging in conversations with students and scholars about the affordances of MEI is equally valuable as is the act of creating encoded music data or full-on MEI projects.\nIn this talk, I will explore some of the barriers that students and scholars new to the MEI often experience and discuss models related to some of my own work as a librarian and digital humanities practitioner; focusing in particular on the “Introduction to the Music Encoding Initiative,” co-written with Raffaele Viglianti and recently published in the DLFteach Toolkit, (https://dlfteach.pubpub.org/toolkit), in which we aim to present music encoding through a low-barrier approach that utilizes open source tools.(3) I will also present examples (such as minimal computing efforts) from the broader digital humanities community that we might borrow from, which embrace the ethos and approaches of critical and digital pedagogy.(4)\n**Notes**\n<small>\n (1) Reed Garber-Pearson and Robin Chin Roemer,: [“Keeping up with digital pedagogy”](http://www.ala.org/acrl/publications/keeping_up_with/digital_pedagogy)\n (2) ACRL, [“Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education”](http://www.ala.org/acrl/standards/ilframework)\n (3) See also [Rebalancing the Music Canon](https://annakijas1.github.io/rebalancing-music-canon/)\n (4) [TEI By Example](https://teibyexample.org/); [Minimal computing](http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/); [Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org).\n \\*By scholar, I mean any person engaged in research or scholarly activity.

BLT engages in the production of discursive spaces wherein artists and community members engage in dialogue on a variety of critical issues. BLT roundtable events provide physical and digital infrastructure for community discourse, which is recorded and archived on the BLT website. Parallel to its creation of physical spaces that foster community and generate critical dialogue, BLT is creating a digital space for a Linked Open Data (LOD) approach to Black studies and social justice issues. BLT's use of network analysis, as an organizing principle for its archive, is an innovative application of DH methods that disrupts traditional archiving practices.\n",

This talk explores the work of writers of electronic literature who, instead of writing sequences of words directly, create a computer program or modify an existing one to generate their intended texts. The practice of creating and repurposing “engines” encourage the development of born-digital poetic forms, such as Nick Montfort’s poem, “Taroko Gorge” which has been remixed hundreds of times since its publication in early 2009. In this talk I will provide a brief history of computational literature and related genres, discuss key characteristics and practices, analyze tools and strategies used for its creation, and identify communities that practice it. The goal of this exploration is to formulate a poetics of distant writing with attention given to how this practice is shaping public tastes and literary aesthetics.\n",

        "talk title": "New Media and Popular Culture",
        "description": "MITH is pleased to sponsor the first of several Digital Dialogues this semester which will spotlight current research by faculty Fellows and Graduate Student award recipients. In this first installment, doctoral candidates **Asim Ali** (American Studies) and **Marc Ruppel** (English) share recent work presented at national conferences in their field for which they received MITH Travel Grants. Join us this time for a heady brew of Buffy, Batman, readers, fans, new media, narrative, and religion. \n**\"Religion, Internet Fandom, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer\"** by Asim Ali \nIn this presentation, I will discuss the mediated interaction of popular culture and religion. I will focus in particular on fans of the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer; this presentation will be based on my ethnographic analysis of that particular group of fans who frequented the official Buffy internet fan site known as The Bronze. There are several ways in which Buffy and religion interact. First, the show is replete with religious references and imagery, and reflects the critical perspective of creator Joss Whedon, an avowed atheist who apparently had few qualms about criticizing religion via Buffy. However, fan interpretations of the religious symbolism in Buffy are often contradictory and contested. Second, not only is there religion in Buffy, but Buffy itself can be seen as a religion. Whedon is the creator of a founding mythology, which he and his production staff–similar to a hierarchically organized clergy–canonized via Buffy. Furthermore, there are several institutions–analogous to a hierarchical laity, of which The Bronze, being officially sanctioned, is at the top–through which the text is interpreted and modified. Third, even though The Bronze is now defunct, the community lives on through several internet sites. Although The Bronze is fragmented and the community no longer has a central location or unifying concept, it maintains its cohesion through a matrix of connections based on the common bond of having been a Bronzer. In this sense, it functions much like a global religious community.\n**\"Idealized Stories, Idealized Readers and Idealized Consumers: Batman Begins and the New Narrative Model\"** by Marc Ruppel\nIn her recent article \"Narrative and Digitality\" (2005), Marie-Laure Ryan describes what she calls texts that think with their medium. These texts possess properties of interactivity/ reactivity, variability, multi-sensorality and networking capabilities. Unique to these sorts of texts is the \"ability to create an original experience which cannot be duplicated by any other medium, an experience which makes the medium seem truly necessary\" (516). Keeping this distinction in mind, this talk will argue that convergent corporate organizations are enabling a new kind of story structure, a cross-sited narrative, that not only implicates the reader/user/viewer in the active construction of an ideal narrative (one that exists as the product of a blending of several variant stories), but also forces an assimilation of the medial \"thoughts\" of a particular channel. Using the film and video game adaptations of Batman Begins as prototypical examples of cross-siting, I will discuss the ways that the structure of the Time Warner Corporation directly influences the form(s) of the dispersed narrative, and posit that the synergy so often sought within this sort of venture ends up vastly complicating issues of authorship, framing and continuity, leading to a shift from a Barthesian idealized reader to something more akin to an idealized consumer. Consequently, instead of narrative being contingent upon a single medium with an isolated set of \"thoughts\", we need to begin talking about an idealized narrative with multiple medialities, one that exists in both local material and non-material \"in-between\" states of meaning.\n",

        "talk title": "Deviant Black Bodies and Embodied Black Feminism in the Blogosphere",
        "description": "Online space often operates within an invisible white universe with blackness becoming apparent only insomuch as it is rendered deviant. In a post-Cosby and Obama era of perceived post-raciality, black people are left to exist purely within the “dominant social imagination as media constructed stars and fantasy figures.” Black characters in popular culture thrive only insomuch as they propel the post racial fantasies of white America. Radhika Mohanram argues that the black body is only black when out of its place, for within context it is but a body. She goes on to point out from Fanon, that the black (wo)man exists to provide perspective rather than to she herself have perspective. A critical analysis of the digital culture of black and white feminist thought in _Jezebel_ and _For Harriet_ provides a site to examine what happens when the subject, the black body, at least temporarily does not exist as an ‘other’ but is squarely within a context that allows it to be merely a body.\nWithin the blogosphere there are rules of invisible whiteness that pervade online interaction. Examining whiteness as embedded within the digital culture of a blog like Jezebel is done by combining material and discursive theories of whiteness focusing on how the codes of conduct privilege white discourse, culture and values. Toni Morrison describes the invisibility of whiteness as the fishbowl that contains both fish and water. While seemingly invisible, whiteness paradoxically “may be hyper-visible as either a preferred or a threatened status”. Whiteness is only made hyper-visible through its absence in the discourse about black character by black. Critical techno-cultural discourse analysis requires us to view technology as artifact, function and belief. Therefore, to better understand technologies as cultural objects we must parse through the beliefs as articulated by users and visible in the content they produce. In a CTDA of two blogs, _For Harriet_ and _Jezebel_ produced for and by women that articulate a feminist agenda. _For Harriet_ intentionally targets black women and centralizes black feminist thought while Jezebel, a feminist blog, implicitly promotes what Mariana Ortega deems ‘white feminism’. The default status of ‘white’ is removed for white feminists who must contend with becoming deviant within the normative universe created by black women in the blogosphere.\nKishonna Gray explains “embodiment is a process rather than a given, and in order to sustain this meaning, it must constantly and continually be articulated and performed.” Black women utilize online blogging platforms in celebration and critique separate from the dominant group. As Jessie Daniels explains, “the Internet offers a “safe space” and a way to not just survive, but also resist, repressive sex/gender regimes. Girls and self-identified women are engaging with Internet technologies in ways that enable them to transform their embodied selves, not escape embodiment.”\n",

        "talk title": "How Were So Many Arabic Authors So Prolific?",
        "description": "This lecture focuses on the size of the Arabic tradition (ca. 700-1500), and the likely role that written practices and cultural expectations played in its development. It is arguably the largest written tradition up to its day, rivalled only by medieval Chinese. I focus, first, on recent work assembling a corpus of 1.3 billion words and the composition of this corpus, including the large number of sizable works. I consider these works in light of evidence for a much larger body of no-longer extant material. Second, I introduce the concept of text “reuse,” our method for detecting and measuring it, and my theory. The theory is this: that the substantial reuse of earlier works resulted both in the emergence of very large works, especially from the 10th century onwards, and secondly, that this reuse resulted in the loss of earlier texts, now absorbed in various ways (including abridgement) into larger ones. Finally, I examine the cultural expectations underpinning reuse, and also how they should make us reconsider, at different times and places, notions of the “book” and “authorship.”\n",

        "talk title": "Nimble Tents",
        "description": "Many years after the idea of a digital humanities galvanized different genealogies of humanistic practice around the world, most institutions in North America have by now each attracted various forms of related talent to their libraries, departments and centers to help build capacity at the institutional level. What happens when that talent begins to collaborate across institutions at a massive scale? Or intra-institutionally guided by their own collaborative light outside established and unflinching reward mechanisms? In this presentation, Dr. Alex Gil will argue for a form of rapid organizing for change in non-hierarchical formats that can effectively draw from our collective talent pool in the digital humanities and adjacent formations. Using several specific case studies, including the most recent Torn Apart/Separados effort, the idea of a nimble tent, a mobilized humanities, will emerge as a possible bridge between the long-game of scholarship, and the short-game of political action in the now.\n",

The goal of the community-rooted digitization project was to create access pathways to historical records from under-documented communities by producing digital surrogates and offering consultation to expand the life of materials held within the communities of color. As Philadelphia gentrifies at a faster rate than San Francisco, well-resourced institutions need to develop inclusive practices that support on-going community archival efforts.

        "description": "_MITH wants everyone in our community to stay healthy and the best way to do that right now is to avoid meetings or gatherings. With sadness, we canceled the final two Digital Dialogues of the Spring 2020 season. We will work with Kristin Carlson on a plan to speak at a later date._\nCurrently, there are many options to track human movement with technology (i.e. capturing body position, number of steps taken, range of motion, how long one has been sitting vs. moving, etc). While these methods tell us a story about our movement, there is more to our experience than technology can tell us yet based on measurements of time and space. My work investigates methods that use technology to reveal what can be known as more “invisible” aspects of movement, which are present but less measurable. These invisible aspects can include qualities of effort, intention, and follow through. Our motivation to move is complex, relying on our self-developed identities, and experiences within the world. We don’t isolate movement from our needs and goals, the way technology needs to. Hence, it is difficult to deconstruct our movement without accounting for the invisible. By using strategies such as defamiliarization and documenting motivation and shifts in creative process, we can start to see new aspects that inform movement knowledge. These approaches can imagine ways that technology can develop to better support our experiences.\n",

Humanities scholars are particularly well suited to help us think through such topics as the status of the archive as it mutates into the database, the possibilities for less hierarchical computing, and the cultural contexts of code. In short, this talk argues that neither theorizing media nor building new technologies is sufficient onto itself; we must necessarily do both.\nAs a concrete example of the relationship of theory to practice, I will look at the work our USC team has undertaken over the last decade, including the digital journal, Vectors, and the new multimodal authoring platform, Scalar. Our research has always been in direct dialogue with key issues in the interpretative humanities, including discussions of race, gender, sexuality, social justice and power. Can such a dialogue come to shape the practice of software design?\n",

MITH will post the new date for this talk along with the Fall 2017 Digital Dialogues schedule in late summer/early fall._\nHow do we seed digital media study – and the digitally-related humanities writ large – with the deep roots of active sustainability, environmental awareness, and eco action (or activism)?\nIn _Greening the Media_, Richard Maxwell and Toby Miller rightly note that “a deep ecological materiality has eluded the humanistic knowledge of media technology.” They point out that the majority of contemporary media studies thinking falls into one of two camps, either humanistic or mechanistic: the humanist focuses primarily on affective results of technologies while the mechanistic theorist looks at digital media’s codes and algorithms. Neither tend properly to the dirty environmental effects of our digital technologies, and I argue, by situating the digital as an affective (humanist) or algorithmic (machinic) artifact, both actually perform de-materializing abstractions that perpetuate the neglect of concrete environmental thinking in the field. Though digital thinking is punctuated by terms like ‘wirelessness,’ ‘the Cloud,’ and notions of immateriality, the truth of course is that our digital network has a very real physical footprint, and even our google searches and spam emails have a carbon output.\nThis presentation responds to Maxwell and Miller’s call for a _deep ecological materiality_ by introducing a metabolic relational ontology that orients the digital network and digital media as constitutive parts of today’s bio- and geo-material metabolisms. The digital network of connected things and connective infrastructure—the_ technosphere_, as so called by Environmental Engineer Peter Haff—is now profoundly entangled with Anthropogenic environmental concerns, and digital studies has a role to play in creating new narratives to capture these emerging relations. Indeed, the Anthropocene prompts us to re-story our digital theory so as to include its full implications—from mineral mining to e-waste and all the energy use, labor exploitation, and pollution in between—in the digital stories we tell.\nThis presentation proposes a method for moving media theory from a praxis grounded in computation to one fully rooted in the earth. It explores how we might infuse digital humanities practice, be it artistic or more research based, with a necessary environmental sensitivity in order to enact deeper engagements with our digital metabolic entanglements.\n",

Connections between these two practices, and between these and other mechanical and literary aesthetic traditions, are discussed. (This is a presentation of joint work with Michael Mateas.)\n",

        "description": "There has been a great deal of recent research on the computational analysis of texts in order to identify sentiment; that is, to determine automatically whether a text expresses a positive or negative perspective or opinion on a topic. Most such work focuses on explicitly expressed opinions, e.g. automatically labeling movie reviews as favorable or unfavorable. In this talk, we will focus on a less studied problem: the computational analysis of implicit sentiment, or spin, in text. We identify underlying semantic properties of statements that predict perceptions of sentiment, and we show how observable syntactic reflexes of those properties can be used, fully automatically, to accurately label a text as expressing a positive or negative attitude toward its topic, even in the absence of overtly opinionated language.\n",

        "talk title": "Doing History in Public",
        "description": "What is the place of digital historians in the larger field of digital humanities? Are digital historians simply public historians working in a new environment? Recently, digital humanists have struggled to find a definition of the field that is sufficiently broad to encompass the goals and methodologies of practitioners from a variety of fields including literary studies, geography, archeology, media studies, classics, and history. Given these disciplinary differences, practitioners approach data and digital tools with different kinds of inquiry questions. Digital historians can draw on the thirty year tradition of public history, which emphasizes collaboration and public engagement. At the same time, they have access to the work of cognitive scientists, who have developed an increasingly sophisticated understanding of the way that people learn history. In combination, these influences yield a version of digital work—“Doing history in public”—that places inquiry questions front and center. This talk will explore the implications of scientific work and the ways that it can clarify the place of digital history within the larger landscape of the digital humanities.\n",

        "talk title": "Performance in Digital Poetry",
        "description": "With origins in the avant-garde movement of the first half of twentieth century, digital poetry extends the creative repertoire of this experimental poetry tradition using computers in the composition, generation, or presentation of texts. If in Italian Futurist poetry performance engages with the traditional conventions such as spatial distribution of elements on page that make the work a poem, in digital poetry performance becomes part of poetry making. Computer programming turns such poetry into interactive sites of encounter between authors, texts, and readers. In so doing, it invites speculation about the nature of poetry and generates debates on how digital spaces represent places where these identities meet, interact, and overlap. Moreover, the aspect of performance as spectacle and of digital poetry as scripted performance in particular, emphasizes a symbiotic relationship between digital poetry and its readers. This talk will approach performance through the lens of three interrelated aspects: as a technique of digital poetry creation; as spectacle; and as representation of cultural intersections. Theoretical considerations drawn from the work of Gianni Toti, Caterina Davinio, and Loss Pequeno Glazier will frame more general discussion of the poetry.\n",

        "talk title": "Tool Mashing",
        "description": "Our interest in the Devonshire MS (BL Add 17492) for almost two hundred years, now, has been in its role as a central textual witness to the works of Thomas Wyatt, but the movement late last century toward social theories of textuality and textual production has drawn significant and new attention to the manuscript. It is now chiefly seen as the product of a relatively large coterie situated in Queen Anne Boleyn’s court at an exciting time in English history (fictionalized grandly by the Tudors’ miniseries;), and quite prominently as the first sustained example of men and women writing together in the English tradition. Even so, what we now find to be most unique and engaging about the document itself is difficult to access, in part because of academic skills and context necessary simply to read and understand it, but in larger part because the connection between prominent identifiable figures and their expressions in the manuscript — which amount in the best cases to multi-voiced discussions and pontifications on matter important to the authors and scribes of the manuscript — is difficult to sustain in any meaningful way using traditional methods. This talk will represent the work of a largish group at UVic who have been working on an edition of the manuscript and, as part of this, have carried out an experimentation in tool mashing / visualization to allow a more coherent engagement of the connection between the people contributing to the manuscript and the nature of the their exchanges and, via this, to enable a significantly increased ability to understand the interpersonal networks evident in the manuscript.\n",

        "description": "Apple’s much-discussed iPad fits more within the logic of consumer society rather than the participatory Web 2.0 with its focus on active participation, diminishing corporate control, and a trend towards free products and services (what has come to be known as “prosumer society”). In contrast to Web 2.0, where users as “prosumers” actively participate in the production of that which they consume and often create systems from the bottom-up, the iPad channels passive consumption, corporate control via “closed” systems and a renewed focus on traditional, top-down, pay-per-view media. Indeed, the iPad is engineered to enforce this passivity, for example through lack of a tactile keyboard. The iPad is indicative of Apple’s Disneyfied approach in the way it produces spectacle to enchant or “wow” individuals into passive consumption, attempts to exercise control by creating a “walled garden,” and seeks to monetize more and more of the interactions within the system.\n",

As the only center of its kind, C21 should take as its mission the development of 21st century studies as an interdisciplinary field. Doing so will allow C21 to set the terms of the debate about the future of 21st century studies for the decades ahead as well as to open the door for collaborations with other individuals and institutions interested in defining the future of 21st century studies.\n",

        "talk title": "Communities Incarnate",
        "description": "In this talk, Maria Velazquez investigates the creative processes through which citizens are made, with particular attention to the role that technologies like blogging, virtual reality, and electronic activism foster the use of “imaginative embodiment” in creating stories of citizenship, selfhood, and action. “Imaginative embodiment” suggests the ways in which performing citizenship involves a mental, emotional, physical, and spiritual investment in incarnating particular political and social ideals. Velazquez’s examines three areas, the Go Mamasita! Dance Studio, a site envisioned as a place where women of color, particularly African-American women, can reconnect with dance ancestry, a nexus to North African dance traditions, filtered through the lens of digital diaspora; _Red Light Center (RLC)_, an adults-only virtual world, similar in design to _World of Warcraft _or _SecondLife, _to discuss the role pre-structuring technology takes in creating erotic virtual cityscapes; and the blogosphere, particularly blogs that grapple with anti-racist discourse, fandom, and popular culture. Through an investigation of these spaces, Velazquez describes the ways individuals engage in virtual and “real-world” activism. Actions and behaviors that highlight the ways in which the language of friendship, holism, and community is mobilized in conversations about citizenship, the body, and desire. While a dance studio, a pornographic virtual world, and segments of the blogosphere may seem like a disparate collection of sites for investigation, all three share an abiding interest in the body and its potential as site of pleasure.\n",

This session has been organized as a mapping party; a social event where a group of mappers and novices descend on an area to map. A brief overview of OSM will be given including its uses in the world before participants organize into small groups and walk a block in College Park. After documenting map features using pen and paper, we’ll learn how to import the data into the site using our computers and the OpenStreetMap website. The specifics of what we’ll map depends on how much interest there is, but may include map roads/sidewalks/bicycle paths, park benches, house numbers, public bathrooms, handicap accessible ramps, and other points of interest.\nGiven time constraints, the mapping party will begin at 12:30pm sharp. No experience is required, and dress comfortably since we’ll be walking outside.

    "description": "_Infinite Ulysses_ was the 2014-15 Winnemore Digital Dissertation project of [Amanda Visconti,](../../people/person/amanda-visconti/index.html) who created a participatory digital edition of James Joyce's difficult but rewarding novel _Ulysses._ This project built on [her master's thesis work](http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/71380) at the University of Michigan School of Information, where she explored user testing for the digital humanities, and how digital archives and editions might be designed to include a public audience.\nThe _Infinite Ulysses_ website creates a community for discussing the text; users can highlight sections of the text to add a comment, question, or interpretation, as well as read, upvote, and tag others' annotations. A variety of sorting, filtering, and toggling options customize the experience to an individual reader's needs, whether that reader knows Church Latin, wants to avoid spoilers, needs extra help as a first-time reader, or is a scholar studying _Ulysses_' puzzles or the function of written material (letters, poems, etc.) throughout the novel.\nAs part of her process, Visconti conducted user testing to gauge the [use, usefulness, and usability](http://www.literaturegeek.com/2012/11/03/the3us/) of the edition. Digital editions are a key humanities scholarly form, but often we don't base our understanding of how they are read and used on data gathered through formal user testing. She used test and analytics data to support the speculative design of the edition as an \"infinite\" _Ulysses_ conversation. Could the site still produce customized reading experiences while storing an \"infinite\" quantity of annotations of various quality? What happens to complex texts---especially those authored to be hypertextual, chaotic, and encyclopedic, like _Ulysses_---when a participatory digital edition places them under \"infinite\" annotations and conversations? Visconti gathered data on reading behavior---such as what pages of the book take users the longest to read, or receive the most annotations, or the most contentious (both up- and down-voted) annotations---as part of her research.\n",

    "description": "Active OCR: Tightening the Loop in Human Computing for OCR Correction will develop a proof-of-concept application that will experiment with the use of active learning and other iterative techniques for the correction of eighteenth-century texts (primarily but not exclusively written in English) provided by the [HathiTrust Digital Library](http://www.hathitrust.org/digital_library) and the 2,231 ECCO text transcriptions released into the public domain by Gale and distributed by the [Text Creation Partnership](http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/) (TCP) and [18thConnect](http://www.18thconnect.org/).\nIn an application based on active learning or a similarly iterative approach, the user could identify dozens or hundreds of difficult characters that appear in the articles from that same time period, and the system would use this new knowledge to improve optical character recognition (OCR) across the entire corpus.\nA portion of our funded efforts will focus on the need to incentivize engagement in tasks of this type, whether they are traditionally crowdsourced or engaged through a more active, iterative process like the one we propose. We intend, as we develop an OCR correction system designed to create opportunities for users to improve the system and not just the text itself, to examine how explorations of a users' preferences can improve their engagement with corpora of materials.\n_The technological infrastructure for this project has been supported in part by a generous grant from [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/)._\n",

    "description": "The Dickinson Electronic Archives (DEA) is a website devoted to the study of Emily Dickinson, her writing practices, writings directly influencing her work, and critical and creative writings generated by her work. The DEA is produced by the Dickinson Editing Collective, with an executive editor, a general editor, two associate editors, a project manager, and a technical editor working collaboratively with one another and with numerous coeditors, staff, and users.\nThe Collective wants to portray Emily Dickinson, one of the United States’ most admired and popular poets and beloved nineteenth century figures, first as a writer. We decided that the best way to do that, then, would be to show the writer at work; i.e., to display the handwritten records of her composing habits and her everyday writing routines. Although our goal is to edit and encode all of Dickinson’s corpus, as well as all of the Dickinson family papers, we begin with a critical edition of Emily Dickinson’s Correspondences. By gaining a more vivid and nuanced sense of the hand-to-hand circulation of her work that Dickinson and her contemporary readers witnessed, Dickinson’s 21st century readers are likely to deepen and broaden understandings of her poetic project.\nInfluence is still an insufficiently examined field in the study of Dickinson’s reception, and is vitally important to editing her writings: therefore, included here are writings by Susan Dickinson, Dickinson’s most frequently addressed correspondent; Edward (Ned) Dickinson: Correspondence & Notebook; Titanic Operas: a Poet’s Corner of Responses to Dickinson’s Legacy; Titanic Operas: Poetry and New Materialities; and Contemporary Youth’s Companion, featuring creative responses from high school and middle school students. Another section of the DEA is devoted to teaching practices, and features The Classroom Electric: Dickinson, Whitman, and American Culture, our co-production with the Walt Whitman Archive made possible by a generous grant from FIPSE (Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education).\n",

    "description": "The Digital Humanities Incubator is a collaboration between MITH and the University Libraries. The program intended to help introduce University of Maryland faculty, staff, and graduate assistants to digital humanities through a series of workshops, tutorials, “office hours,” and project consultations. In our first year (2013), the Incubator concentrated on working with UMD Libraries exclusively. Future iterations will include faculty, staff, and students from across campus.\n### Project Overview\nAcademic libraries are reinventing themselves in support of teaching, research, and public service, but organizational culture often conspires against meaningful reform. Fostering new opportunities for creativity and innovation itself requires innovation.\nParticipating in and supporting digital scholarship is a key strategic need for academic libraries as the materials and analytical practices of many disciplines become increasingly digital. Both collections and services must evolve in response. These changes require libraries to develop new skills among staff and to realign roles and work patterns.\nThe University of Maryland Libraries and the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) have created a unique program to develop and train librarians in new, digital skills. This program, the Digital Humanities Incubator, has not only delivered practical training but it has also raised visibility of creative and enterprising opportunities for digital work across different divisions of organization and it has contributed to a far-reaching cultural change.\nParticipants in the Digital Humanities Incubator are guided through a series of workshops and exercises on the process of developing digital humanities project ideas, finding data, evaluating tools, and crafting a compelling proposal for internal or external funding. Skills learned in this program are grounded in participants’ own project ideas and interests, supported by brief in-depth lectures. The program thus offers a model for nurturing digitally engaged, research-intensive librarianship. With this training, librarians can reclaim roles as authors and leaders of the academic research mission of the university—marrying information organization and curation with scholarship and public engagement through the use of digital technologies.\nThe Incubator also contributes directly to librarians’ ability to act as subject liaisons with faculty. By understanding the project development process themselves, librarians can better communicate the potential of digital projects to faculty, help identify opportunities that integrate library collections, and enlist faculty and student researchers in joint projects. By engaging with faculty in this meaningful way—as practitioners trained in aspects of digital scholarship—librarians are increasing their value to the campus community and supporting the university’s mission.\nBeyond serving as a training program, an important function of the Incubator has been to foster an experimental culture in the Libraries. The Incubator model offers a safe place for librarians to brainstorm, learn, and grow and is but one example of a larger effort to provide an experimental culture that allows innovation to thrive. Many other solid examples exist within the University of Maryland Libraries. The Libraries’ work to engage stakeholders in an architectural redesign of the main library proved so successful the process is now a model for other campus-wide planning measures. The newly created Digital Stewardship Unit offers guidance and support for digital projects such as journal publishing. Librarians and others gather monthly over brown-bag lunches to teach each other about new programs, apps or resources they’ve discovered. The Incubator serves as a common ground where these and other internal activities such as the work of a task force on competencies for liaison librarians.\nThe workshop cycle consisted of four workshops, each held twice. Workshops on each topic were offered once in the morning and once in the afternoon on alternate days, spaced at least two days apart. This allowed part-time librarians, library division heads, and full-time reference/subject librarians to have the opportunity to attend without having to make special work arrangements. This also allowed for librarians to repeat the same workshop content to allow for differing types of learning styles. Librarians were able to attend the first workshop, listening and taking notes, then return for the second to ask questions and further understand what they might have missed the first time. This was particularly important for the “data” workshop where participants were encouraged to scrape, manipulate, and explore data in ways unfamiliar to most librarians but crucial to much digital humanities work.\nAdditionally, by interlacing office hours with each workshop, the instructional team was able to revise content, post answers to questions, and facilitate immediate interventions on the project level where needed. In part, this blended structure combining instruction with hands-on work with participants’ own project ideas allowed for quick implementation, demonstration of core concepts, discussion and reflection. Librarians attending without their own project were encouraged to join a colleague’s. This “learn and do” philosophy enabled collaboration across divisions in rewarding ways.\n### History of Development and Implementation\nThe University Libraries and MITH are longtime partners. With the university’s College of Arts and Humanities, the University Libraries have supported MITH since its founding in 1999. MITH, which can claim a successful string of digital humanities projects, made its home in the university’s main library until last year when it moved to spacious new offices in the special collections library. However, as MITH flourished—having secured funding from grantors including the National Endowment for the Humanities, the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Science Foundation, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the Library of Congress and the Institute for Museum and Library Services—its partnership with the University Libraries lapsed.\nFor example: MITH’s faculty fellowship program, geared to the needs of research faculty, did not meet the needs of librarians, who had little time or expertise to pursue their own digital initiatives. Only two projects out of over a dozen in the history of MITH’s fellowships have included librarians as primary investigators. Technology often outpaced librarians’ ability to leverage it. Furthermore, severe budget limitations (hiring freezes, state-imposed furloughs, and subsequent exodus of young talent) demoralized many and stifled innovative thinking.\nAs a first step in reinvigorating the partnership, in 2011 the University Libraries and MITH created and funded a joint position. The Assistant Dean for Digital Humanities Research at the University of Maryland Libraries, Trevor Muñoz, is also MITH’s Associate Director. He develops joint projects between MITH and the Libraries, coordinates activities and initiatives, and leads a digital scholarship strategy along with library colleagues. These activities have crystallized as a formal, annually revised charter between the Libraries and MITH that identifies roles, responsibilities and goals for each partner. As part of that charter, the partners committed to providing support to each other’s strategic goals. The library appointed a new liaison for digital humanities, Ms. Kelsey Corlett-Rivera, while MITH opened its project development and grant writing expertise to library divisions through consultations with Assistant Director Dr. Jennifer Guiliano. These small steps to develop capacity to have the partners’ expertise “on-call” set the stage for the development of the Digital Humanities Incubator.\n### Intended Clientele and Assessment\nThe Digital Humanities Incubator at Maryland has been targeted at academic librarians and staff who wish to gain new skills for developing, supporting, and leading digital projects. MITH previously supported individual faculty projects through a fellowship program targeted at the College of Arts and Humanities. Faculty within the College of Arts and Humanities generally are nine month long appointments and maintain a regular schedule of leave to support their research activities. Additionally, they have regular access to University resources to support their research. Librarians, on the other hand, while they can hold faculty status are employed twelve months of the year and do not receive university-level support for their research activities.\nFrom the beginning the Incubator was explicitly framed as an experiment to develop a more broad-based, programmatic collaboration between the Libraries and MITH. In order to assess the impact of the program, the Incubator’s directors solicited feedback from participants about their experiences. Quantitative and qualitative online surveys were distributed to librarians who participated. Assessment activities sought to explore not just the effect of the incubator on librarians’ knowledge of digital humanities methodologies and tools but also how the institutional partners (Libraries and MITH) could surface and support long-term research initiatives building on ideas first explored within the Incubator. As part of assessment, Mr. Muñoz and Dr. Guiliano also conducted individual consultations with 15 Incubator participants leading up to and following the fourth and final workshop in the series. These qualitative interviews allowed for revisions of workshop content, identification of potential projects and library partners, as well as the opportunity to identify additional resources needed from MITH and the University Libraries to support innovative librarianship.\nParticipants were encouraged but not required to “pitch” an idea for a digital project during the capstone event for the Incubator program. These short (5-minute) presentations drew on skills acquired during the Incubator, forcing participants to frame their research interests in terms of potential audiences, available technologies, and overall feasibility of timeframes and budgets. Thirteen librarians or teams of librarians participated in the “[pitch round](http://mith.umd.edu/community/dh-events/event/digital-humanities-incubator/)” during the capstone event. These presentations were evaluated by an audience of their peers from the Libraries as well as by the MITH staff. Five finalists were chosen to continue refining their proposals for a potential joint project with the MITH staff. Further joint work with MITH staff includes an additional six months of group work focusing on the creation of project prototypes and the development of a full-fledged project proposal for funding support. The selection of these “next-stage” projects was based on their potential innovation and alignment with the Libraries’ and MITH’s strategic goals.\nIn Spring of 2013, MITH extended offers to Lara Otis and Doug McElrath to serve as affiliated researchers at MITH for six months while they worked on their proposed projects. These two projects raised similar issues, had similar technical needs, and spoke interestingly to each other as potential digital resources about the changing American landscape.\nProposals not selected also generated new digital initiatives for the Libraries by being turned back to divisions that could assist in their development. These spin-off projects—one related to crowdsourcing and one related to acquisition of basic programming skills—will be further articulated with the assistance of the Libraries’ Digital Stewardship unit during 2013 – 14.\nBased on assessment of the program, the Digital Humanities Incubator will be sustained as a joint activity represented in the formal charter for the partnership between the Libraries and MITH. Content created as part of the Incubator series will be released under a Creative Commons license by the instructors for use by other institutions. Significantly, the University of Maryland Libraries have committed to 20% staff release time for librarians involved in at least one “next-stage” project librarian emerging from the Incubator. Additionally, Mr. Muñoz and Dr. Guiliano will be working with the Digital Stewardship Unit and MITH to train additional instructors in the Incubator series to offer additional workshops and training in future iterations so as to insulate the Incubator from disruption by administrative leave or other staffing changes among current personnel.\n",

Kress Foundation, the [Department of Art History and Archaeology](http://arthistory.umd.edu/) and the [Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities](../../index.html) (MITH) of the [University of Maryland, College Park](http://www.umd.edu/), present _Art History in Digital Dimensions_, a three-day symposium in Washington, D.C. and College Park. The symposium aims to unite diverse audiences and practitioners in a critical intervention for the digital humanities and digital art history, providing a cogent and inclusive road map for the future.\nThe symposium will begin at The Phillips Collection on Wednesday, October 19 with a keynote lecture given by [Paul B. Jaskot](http://dah-dimensions.org/participants/), Professor of Art History at DePaul University, on the theme \"Why Digital Art History?\" On Thursday and Friday, October 20-21, sessions in College Park will include roundtables, break-out sessions, lightning round presentations, and plenaries. Topics of discussion will include collaborative, trans-disciplinary models of research; the implications of data-driven approaches to art history and the humanities; legal and ethical obligations of scholars and museum professionals engaging art history in the digital world; and the innovative array of objects for study presupposed by digital art history.\n",

        "description": "The Music Encoding Conference is the annual focal point for the Music Encoding Initiative community.\nMusic encoding is a critical component of the emerging fields of digital musicology, digital editions, symbolic music information retrieval, and others. At the centre of these fields, the Music Encoding Conference has emerged as an important cross-disciplinary venue for theorists, musicologists, librarians, and technologists to meet and discuss new advances in their fields.\nThis year’s theme “_Encoding and Performance_” will explore the relationship between music encoding and performance practice, such as digital dynamic scores, use of encoded music for pedagogical purposes related to performance, and speculation about future interconnections.\n\n### Tuesday, May 22\nWorkshops\n_McKeldin Library_\n### Wednesday, May 23 – Thursday May 24\nMain conference at the Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center\n_Gildenhorn Recital Hall and Grand Pavilion_\n### Friday, May 25\nMEI community meeting and “unconference” at Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanites (MITH)\n_Hornbake Library_\n",

    "description": "Also referred to as _Narratives of Creativity: Creating New Sites for Personal and Cross-Cultural Exploration_, this was a 2002 Faculty Fellowship project of Professor Carolina Robertson from the Ethnomusicology Department. Based on the core premise that creativity is not necessarily a state of grace rooted in innate talent or skill, a series of seminars were offered through the University’s ‘[Teachers as Scholars](https://web.archive.org/web/20040511212856/http://www.arhu.umd.edu/outreach/tas/)‘ program, in which teacher participants explored their own life narratives as doorways to creativity against a backdrop of parallel stories from other cultures. Dr. Robertson worked with a MITH programmer to develop an interactive website with malleable texts, sounds and images as the dynamic outcome of this process.\nThe [project description found on the website (as of 2002)](https://web.archive.org/web/20030118091517/http://www.mith2.umd.edu/nth/index2.html) stated “Each of us contains the innate right and ability to create, whether through the expressive arts or through other vehicles that allow us to imagine and manifest the life we want to live. This project addresses the creative process as it is framed and experienced in many cultures. The personal narratives that constitute the main corpus of data were gathered during three decades of field research in Ghana, Hawai’i, and Latin America. These stories reflect several themes or patterns identifying the journeys that have led the teller towards integrating creative processes into daily life.\nOur goal is to discover how we can clear out misconceptions and other obstacles in our own narratives that keep us from embracing our own creativity. Whether we are artists, physicists, actors, teachers, lawyers, writers, electricians, dancers, accountants, social activists, administrators, or musicians we can harness the forces in us that allow us to express aspects of being that cannot be accounted for in words and work. By opening and exploring these coffers we can create new life narratives in which we visualize, imagine, and manifest our full potential.”\n",

This session will explore the vital participation of African American and European American women in U.S. public life during the early twentieth century. Analyses of women's activism will illuminate racial politics early in the century; the role of women in Progressive reform; the contributions of women to the welfare state; and the legacy of progressive era activists to American democracy in the twentieth century.\n",

        "description": "During the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, Europe, Africa, and the Americas came together to create new societies and economies. Central to that new world history—perhaps the first true world history—was the institution of slavery, as slaves provided the labor force that drove this new international economy. Thereafter, no one was untouched by the institution of chattel bondage. Any study of world history must address the institution of slavery, not only for its social and economic importance but also as a moral rupture that has not healed.\nWhat is true for the world is most certainly true for the United States. For most of American history, the United States was a slave society. Understanding slavery is critical to understanding American life.\nPerhaps for that reason, the history—meaning the changing nature—of slavery has been subjected to intensive investigation during the last generation. Over time and in different places, the slave experience changed radically. Understanding that—after all change is history’s essence—is critical to understanding slavery.\nSlavery is also ground zero for American race relations. Like slavery, race—the meaning of whiteness and blackness—changed over time. How and why it changed is also of critical importance.\nFinally, slavery does not exist only in history; it also exists in memory. Memory is profoundly different from history. It is the memory of slavery as much as its history that stirs recent studies of slavery in American culture and society.\n",

        "talk title": "Dictators and Democracy",
        "description": "The first regime of Brazil’s Getulio Vargas is often compared with other authoritarian regimes of the 1930s. In many ways, this makes perfect sense: between 1937 and 1945, Vargas abolished political parties and suspended civil liberties. He brooked no political opposition. But, in other ways, the first Vargas regime was surprisingly flexible. This workshop explores this flexibility in the regime’s cultural policy, which embraced modernism as a defining element of one version of Brazilian nationalism.\n",

        "talk title": "Dictators and Democracy",
        "description": "In the face of the Great Depression, democracy receded from many places around the world. Even in the United States, where commitments to democracy were of relatively long standing, many Americans in the 1930s openly admired the efficiency of Mussolini’s Italy. Nevertheless, democracy did not fade from the United States. Indeed, many trends suggested invigorated democratic practice in the country. At the same time, Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s New Deal failed to benefit all Americans equally. Those who suffered most gained the least from this bold new departure in U.S. domestic policy. This workshop explores both the democratic and anti-democratic tendencies of Roosevelt’s New Deal.\n",

ANGLES will experiment with a solution to the adoption gap that has developed between scholars with digital materials and technical developers designing the applications scholars are using in their research by combining the model of intensive code development (a.k.a. the “code sprint”) with testing and feedback by domain experts gathered at nationally recognized disciplinary conferences.\n",

    "description": "The **Building an Accessible Future for the Humanities Project** facilitated four two-day long workshops where humanists, librarians, information scientists, and cultural heritage professionals learned about technologies, design standards, and accessibility issues associated with the use of digital technologies. This important project was a partnership with the BrailleSC.org project, the Northeastern University Center for Digital Humanities, the Emory University Libraries Digital Commons (DiSC), the Center for Digital Research in the Humanities (CDRH) at the University of Nebraska (UNL), and the College of Information at the University of Texas at Austin (UT).\nWhile scholars who offer courses have been able to turn to their University-level instructional technologies staff for accessibility, scholars who are designing, building, and implementing digital products outside of the classroom (as most humanities-research projects do) have been unable to get the help or guidance that they need. These types of research and the issues of accessibility that they raise with are not the same accessibility issues usually addressed by disability support services offices on university campuses. These campus resources generally concentrate on students and their engagement with course materials (exams and textbooks) or the physical environment (assistive devices). As a result, humanists, librarians, and others looking for assistance in building, designing, and implementing digital projects for assisted users have been largely ignored. Accessible Future will engage those working in digital humanities, information studies, librarianship, and cultural heritage work with resources, training, and a community of people that can assist them with accessibility issues in their own research, training, and teaching.\n",

    "description": "Funded by a grant from the NEH, the purpose of this meeting was respond to the ACLS Cyberinfrastructure Commission’s call for digital humanities centers to become key nodes of cyberinfrastructure in the United States. The summit was especially concerned with assessing the value of and the desire for greater collaboration and communication among the centers; among the funders; and between both groups. The NEH and the summit steering committee invited participants from a representative group and range of 17 digital humanities centers, as well as 14 key funders of the field, including NEH, Mellon, NSF, IMLS, ACLS, the Getty, and the Luce, Macarthur, and Sloan Foundations, plus two representatives from Google.\nThe summit consisted of opening plenary talks by John Unsworth and Vint Cerf of Google. These were followed the next day by morning plenary and breakout sessions devoted to finding common ground and afternoon plenary and breakout sessions devoted to discussing where we wanted to go from there.\nThe summit was documented in a [comprehensive Wiki](https://apps.lis.illinois.edu/wiki/display/DHC/Digital+Humanities+Centers+Summit), which included a detailed report on the summit, including a list of participants, a copy of the agenda, reports from the breakout groups, and John Unsworth’s plenary talk. It also contained a link to a new website with a taxonomic listing of all the digital humanities centers to foster disciplinary innovation and transformation in the humanities. which was eventually named [centerNet](https://archive.mith.umd.edu/mith-2020/research/project/centernet/index.html).\n",

        "description": "Funded by a grant from the NEH, the purpose of this meeting was respond to the ACLS Cyberinfrastructure Commission’s call for digital humanities centers to become key nodes of cyberinfrastructure in the United States. The summit was especially concerned with assessing the value of and the desire for greater collaboration and communication among the centers; among the funders; and between both groups. The NEH and the summit steering committee invited participants from a representative group and range of 17 digital humanities centers, as well as 14 key funders of the field, including NEH, Mellon, NSF, IMLS, ACLS, the Getty, and the Luce, Macarthur, and Sloan Foundations, plus two representatives from Google.\nThe summit consisted of opening plenary talks by John Unsworth and Vint Cerf of Google. These were followed the next day by morning plenary and breakout sessions devoted to finding common ground and afternoon plenary and breakout sessions devoted to discussing where we wanted to go from there.\nThe summit was documented in a [comprehensive Wiki](https://apps.lis.illinois.edu/wiki/display/DHC/Digital+Humanities+Centers+Summit), which included a detailed report on the summit, including a list of participants, a copy of the agenda, reports from the breakout groups, and John Unsworth’s plenary talk. It also contained a link to a new website with a taxonomic listing of all the digital humanities centers to foster disciplinary innovation and transformation in the humanities. which was eventually named [centerNet](https://archive.mith.umd.edu/mith-2020/research/project/centernet/index.html).\n",

The compendium reveals recent declines in voluntary reading and test scores alike, exposing trends that have severe consequences for American society. Like its controversial predecessor, _Reading at Risk_ (2004), the new report has provoked a widespread debate with recent coverage in such outlets at the _New York Times_, the _Wall Street Journal_, and the _Guardian_. \nSunil Iyengar, one of the primary architects of the report, will present an overview of its findings and take questions about its methodology and conclusions.\n",

The LGBT Studies Program, like the programs and departments in Afro-American Studies, Asian American Studies, Jewish Studies, Latin-American Studies, and Women's Studies that preceded it, is part of the institution's broad and deep effort to transform curricula to reflect new developments in multicultural scholarship and to provide students with a set of educational experiences that convey some sense of the diversity of human cultures.

    "description": "_Broadcasting Audiovisual Data_ is an initiative funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities to enhance discoverability of archival radio collections using a linked open data framework. A partnership between MITH and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the project is an expansion of the previous NEH-funded project _[Unlocking the Airwaves](https://mith.umd.edu/research/unlocking-the-airwaves/)_. While _Airwaves_ was centered on virtually reuniting one set of geographically separated collections, the National Association of Educational Broadcasters' (NAEB) paper and media collections, _Broadcasting A/V Data_ will connect the linked NAEB collections to three additional complementary collections of educational radio, community radio, and public radio history. These include [The National Federation of Community Broadcasters](https://www.lib.umd.edu/news/2018/08/nfcb) (NFCB) collections at UMD Libraries; the [Wisconsin Public Radio](https://www.library.wisc.edu/news/2019/05/17/uw-madison-archives-receives-clir-award-to-digitize-250-at-risk-recordings/) (WHA) collections at University of Wisconsin-Madison Libraries; and the [WLB/KUOM collections](https://www.continuum.umn.edu/2019/10/u-libraries-receives-44000-for-radio-digitization/) at University of Minnesota Libraries. \nEducational and public broadcasting collections are a window into the history of the American experience. These collections are not just about unique content. They’re also about unique people and organizations. We’ll use those people and organizations as connective tissue between siloed collections of historic radio to promote new discoveries not just about the history of broadcasting, but about the history of how Americans shared their stories with each other during some of our nation’s most culturally tumultuous decades.\nMITH, UW-Madison and our content partners will also be building on the work of other national projects, including the [Social Networks and Archival Context Cooperative](https://portal.snaccooperative.org/about) (SNAC) project and [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page), both of which increase context and discoverability for archival collections through the use of linked data and archival authority aggregation. We will also extend and augment workflows for creating new data endpoints for increased access to all four collections. This will include surfacing select people and organizations to Wikipedia, and the creation of 'linked open exhibits' with a team of scholars who will craft new scholarship made possible by the newly-linked collections.\nThe project will be a model for future initiatives that seek to connect and contextualize disbursed a/v collections, by innovating new workflows and methods for integrating archival collections data in a way that reaches diverse user groups, ranging from expert scholars to the general public. Linking these collections will enable robust research across a number of fields across the humanities, including media studies, cultural history, sociology, and more. \n",

    "description": "The Steinschneider Bibliographic Database is a digitized relational database for the study of pre-modern Jewish philosophy, science, and belles-lettres, based on the standard reference-work, Die Hebraeischen Ubersetzungen des Mittelalters und dir Juden als Dolmetscher (The Hebrew Translations of the Middle Ages and the Jews as Interpreters, henceforth HU).\nWritten by Moritz Steinschneider in 1893, HU is a thousand-page bibliographical study of over eleven hundred medieval Hebrew manuscripts composed during the golden age of Jewish philosophy and science. It is the most authoritative source for the influence on non-Jewish culture upon Jewish culture during the Middle Ages. Although unrivaled and unsurpassed, Steinschneider’s work is dated and in need of revision. The Steinschneider Bibliographical Database (SBD) includes a translation and ongoing update of HU, a comprehensive list of extant manuscripts in the relevant areas with pictures of the first folios of each manuscript, selected English translations (where available and permission is attainable), and links to further information. All the materials of the SBD is available for scholars digitally.\nWhile the SBD is geared primarily for scholars, it will have immediate pedagogic value in college courses and for Jewish high schools. Using the SBD, this project hopes to kindle interest among high school and college students in the study of the history of science and philosophy among the Jews.\n",

Please join us for these two presentations. \n**\"Yintong: the Chinese Phonological Database\"** by David Prager Branner, _Associate Professor of Chinese_ \nYintong is a database of Chinese historical phonology with a number of new search mechanisms. It is designed to make this arcane but important body of knowledge accessible to students and other non-specialists who can use it in the study of modern Chinese dialects, classical literature, and historical linguistics.\n**\"The Steinschneider Bibliographical Database: Digitizing a Classic Reference Work for Arabic and Latin Premodern Philosophy, Science, Medicine, and Literature Translated into Hebrew\"** by Chip Manekin, _Associate Professor of Philosophy_ \nIn 1893 the Austrian Jewish scholar Moritz Steinschneider published the crowning achievement of a long and distinguished scholarly career — a thousand page bibliographical essay (in German) entitled The Hebrew Translations of the Middle Ages, and the Jews as Transmitters. For over a century, the Hebrew Translations of the Middle Ages has been the primary reference source for medieval Jewish philosophy, science, medicine, and literature, translated from the Arabic and Latin into Hebrew. It is the classic work on the translation movement of the High Middle Ages from Arabic and Latin into Hebrew. Over a century old, it has never been translated, revised, or updated. The Steinschneider Bibliographical Database (SBD), a project of MITH and funded in part by an NEH collaborative grant, will be a fully searchable English translation, revision, and update of Steinschneider’s work prepared by scholars in Germany, Israel, and the US that will be available to scholars on the world wide web. As part of the website scholars will be able to consult digital images of Steinschneider’s own annotated copy of the original German, as well the fifteen-hundred page handwritten French memoire that preceded the German print edition.\n",

    "description": "The Digital Humanities Incubator is a program intended to help introduce University faculty, staff, and graduate assistants to digital humanities through a series of workshops, tutorials, “office hours,” and project consultations. Participants in the Digital Humanities Incubator are guided through a series of workshops and exercises on the process of developing digital humanities project ideas, finding data, evaluating tools, and crafting a compelling proposal for internal or external funding.\nThis first phase of the Incubator in 2012-13 concentrated on working with UMD Libraries faculty and staff exclusively. Academic libraries are reinventing themselves in support of teaching, research, and public service, but organizational culture often conspires against meaningful reform. Participating in and supporting digital scholarship is a key strategic need for academic libraries as the materials and analytical practices of many disciplines become increasingly digital. These changes require libraries to develop new skills among staff and to realign roles and work patterns.\nParticipants in the Digital Humanities Incubator were guided through a series of workshops and exercises. Skills learned in this program were grounded in participants’ own project ideas and interests, supported by brief in-depth lectures. The program offered a model for nurturing digitally engaged, research-intensive librarianship. The Incubator also contributed directly to librarians’ ability to act as subject liaisons with faculty. By understanding the project development process themselves, librarians were able to better communicate the potential of digital projects to faculty, help identify opportunities that integrate library collections, and enlist faculty and student researchers in joint projects.\nThe four workshops featured **1)** an Introduction to Digital Humanities, **2)** a workshop on developing your research ideas, **3)** a workshop on working with data, and **4)** project development best practices. Participants who attended the entire workshop sequence were guided through the process of developing digital humanities project ideas, finding data, evaluating tools, and crafting a compelling proposal for funding support (internal or external).\nThe second phase of DH Incubator, entitled “[Researching Ferguson](https://archive.mith.umd.edu/mith-2020/research/digital-humanities-incubator-2014-15-researching-ferguson/index.html),” occurred in 2014-15 as a broader campus-wide initiative to provide leadership and training on event-based social media data and network analysis\n",

To celebrate everyone's great work, MITH will be hosting a capstone event and party on **Monday, December 17, from 1:00-3:00 pm **(Hornbake 0301).\nLibrarians and staff who have participated in the Incubator process will present very brief \"project pitches\" describing their ideas for digital projects. In the spring, MITH will continue collaborating on the best of these proposals—to help create the first version of the digital project. We'll be hearing presentations from across every division of the Libraries. So, no matter which project is selected, this capstone event will be a great demonstration of the creativity and scholarship of Maryland librarians and staff.\n**Please, come join us and support your colleagues!**\nCookies and light refreshments will be served.\n",

    "description": "The BitCurator project has been a joint effort led by the School of Information and Library Science at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (SILS) and the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) to develop a system for collecting professionals that incorporates the functionality of many digital forensics tools.\nThere are already many cases of self-contained Linux-based packages that bundle many of the tools in order to support digital forensics activities. However, they are not very approachable to library/archives professionals in terms of interface and documentation.\nThere are two fundamental needs for collecting institutions that are not addressed by software designed for the digital forensics industry: incorporation into the workflow of archives/library ingest and collection management environments, and provision of public access to the data.\nTo address these needs, over phase one of the BitCurator project (October 2011 – September 2013), the BitCurator team developed the BitCurator environment, a highly customized version of Ubuntu Linux. The BitCurator environment includes a suite of open source digital forensics tools along with a custom interface that make these tools accessible to librarians and archivists working with digital media. Through the use of these tools, Libraries Archives and Museums (LAMs) can capture bit-for-bit copies of data contained on digital storage devices, scan digital holdings for sensitive information, generate technical metadata reports detailing the content of digital media, and more. Over the course of this development, the BitCurator team was advised by two groups of external partners: a [Professional Expert Panel](http://www.bitcurator.net/people/#pep) (PEP) of individuals who are at various levels of implementing digital forensics tools and methods in their collecting institutions, and a [Development Advisory Group](http://www.bitcurator.net/people/#dag) (DAG) of individuals who have significant experience with software development.\nPhase two of the BitCurator project (October 2013 – September 2014) continued the development of the BitCurator environment and, in addition, included a concerted outreach and engagement effort to build a sustaining BitCurator users community. These outreach and community building efforts were spearheaded by the BitCurator Community Lead who conducted both online and in-person BitCurator trainings at collecting institutions across the United States and Europe.\nNow at the conclusion of phase two, [the BitCurator Consortium](http://www.bitcurator.net/bitcurator-consortium/) (BCC) has been established as an independent, community-led membership association that will serve as the host and center of administrative, user and community support for the BitCurator environment. As a charter member of the BCC, MITH will continue to be an active partner in the BitCurator project as it enters the next phase of its development.\n_BitCurator has been funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation._\n",

        "talk title": "What Falls Out: Preserving Our Digital Heritage with BitCurator",
        "description": "Take a moment and open your bottom desk drawer, the one with your old files in it. Rummage around for a bit and push way back until you see the inevitable papers, notes and detritus that have slipped out of various file folder and now lay at the bottom of the drawer. You will undoubtedly find papers back there, but you may also have a floppy disk or two, maybe a CD-ROM from a project long since set aside, or perhaps a flash memory card that has slipped between the folders. However, unlike the paper that surrounds them, these digital media are increasingly inaccessible as the hardware and software needed to access the data they contain are lost to disrepair, obsolescence and bit rot. It is worth taking a moment, while it is still at least possible to recover the data on these legacy drives, to think about what they contain: drafts of work since published, data accumulated over the course of a project, images and design work once painstakingly pored over. Like the leavings at the bottom of a drawer, these digital objects are frequently “what falls out” as we create, research, record and publish our digital work.\nDrawing on examples from a number of disciplines, this talk addresses both the necessity of preserving our digital heritage contained on legacy media and the means by which that preservation can be accomplished using the [BitCurator environment](http://wiki.bitcurator.net/), which is a customized Linux distribution designed to bring open source digital forensics tools to collecting institutions. The BitCurator environment is the product of the [BitCurator project](http://www.bitcurator.net./): a joint effort led by the School of Information and Library Science at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (SILS) and the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) to develop a system for collecting professionals that incorporates the functionality of many digital forensics tools.\n",

The conference theme is \"Textual Embodiments,\" broadly construed. With this theme we will engage a range of issues involving the materiality of texts, including their physical, virtual, or performative manifestations as objects that can decay or break down and can potentially be repaired and sustained over time. It also concerns the processes of inclusion and exclusion through which bodies of texts take shape in the form of editions, archives, collections, and exhibition building, as well as the ethical responsibilities faced by textual scholars, archivists, conservationists, media archaeologists, digital resource creators, and cultural heritage professionals engaging in these processes.\n[Call for Papers](../../announcing-society-textual-scholarships-2017-call-papers/index.html) (due March 6, 2017) -- _CFP Closed_\n",

    "description": "MONK was a digital environment designed to help humanities scholars discover and analyze patterns in the texts they study. It supported both micro analyses of the verbal texture of an individual text and macro analyses that let you locate texts in the context of a large document space consisting of hundreds or thousands of other texts. Shuttling between the “micro” and the “macro” was a distinctive feature of the MONK environment, where you may read as closely as you wish but can also practice many forms of what Franco Moretti has provocatively called “distant reading.”\nMONK stands for Metadata Offer New Knowledge, and metadata (data about data) are at the heart of its very radical “divide and conquer” strategy. For every document in a MONK environment there were explicitly recorded metadata at the top level (bibliographical data), at the bottom level of individual word occurrence (lexical, morphological, and syntactic data), and at the mid-level of discursive organization (chapters, scenes, stanzas, etc). This triple-decker structure of metadata helped to organize the MONK inventory of words in a collection. Visualization tools played a critical role in helping scholars both formulate the questions they want to ask and interpret the result sets their questions produce.\nAll code produced by the project is open source and is available for download. Public domain TEI texts (with MONK-added enhanced markup) that were used during the project are also available for download. Downloads (code and TEI) [can be found here](http://quest.library.illinois.edu/monk/project/downloads/). Be advised that newer versions of both code and TEI texts may be available elsewhere. The MONK download page provides a static snapshot of code and data as of the end of the active development phase of the project (2010).\nThe MONK Workbench is no longer available (as of the fall of 2013), but select algorithms from the Workbench and alternate plain text (OCR’d) digital instances of some of the works included in MONK are available via the HathiTrust Research Center Portal. Once you create an account on the HTRC Portal, you can log in and use the MONKmatch workset, or create and analyze your own workset.\nThe MONK project also maintained a wiki which included project documentation and a number reports and meeting summaries. [A portion of the wiki has been preserved here, and is available for browsing](https://apps.lis.illinois.edu/wiki/display/MONK/The+MONK+Project+Wiki).\n",

    "description": "This was a Spring 2007 MITH Winnemore Digital Dissertation Fellowship project of Nadja Masura. Her dissertation, “Digital Theatre,” examined the ways that digital technology–such as animation, video, motion capture/sensing, and internet broadcasting–when used along with “live” co-present actors, expands our ideas of body, place, and community.\nDigital Theatre is a type of performance which utilizes both “live” actors and co-present audiences along with digital media to create a hybrid art form revitalizing theatre for contemporary audiences. This work surveys a wide range of digital performances (with “live” and digital elements, limited interactivity/participation and spoken words) and identifies the group collectively as Digital Theatre, an art form with the flexibility and reach of digital data and the sense of community found in “live” theatre. Masura offers performance examples from Mark Reaney, David Saltz, Troika Ranch, Gertrude Stein Repertory Theatre, Flying Karamazov Brothers, Talking Birds, Yacov Sharir, Studio Z, George Coates Performance Group, and ArtGrid. (The technologies utilized in performances include: video-conferencing, media projection, MIDI control, motion capture, VR animation, and AI). Rather than looking at these productions as isolated events, she identifies them as a movement and link the use of digital techniques to continuing theatrical tradition of utilizing new technologies on the stage. The work ties many of the aesthetic choices explored in theatrical past by the likes of Piscator, Svoboda, Craig, and in Bauhaus and Futurist movements. While it retains the essential qualities of public human connection and imaginative thought central to theatre, Digital Theatre can cause theatrical roles to merge as it extends the performer’s body, expands our concept of place, and creates new models of global community.\n",

    "description": "Langston Terrace is the nation’s first public housing program built in Washington, D.C. Opened in 1937, Langston Terrace housed Black low-income, working class families; it was one of 51 racially segregated projects built by the Public Works Administration as part of the New Deal. The architect, Hilyard Robinson, combined his experience as a native Washingtonian, his concern for housing solutions for low-income families, and his commitment to his race in this project. In so doing, Robinson followed in the tradition of the project’s namesake, John Mercer Langston who served as the first Black American to serve in the United States Congress. John Mercer Langston represented Virginia in the House of Representatives. Hilyard Robinson, like Langston before him, advocated for social reform for Washington’s poor residents.\nNestled on a naturally terraced site overlooking the Anacostia River, Langston Terrace stands at the corner of Benning Road and 21 Street, in Northeast. The initial complex housed 274 units; in 1965, 34 units were added just North of the original site. In 1987, the National Park Service recognized Langston Terrace’s architectural and social significance by placing it on the National Register of Historic Places. This past summer, D.C. Preservation League placed Langston on its list of Most Endangered Places 2001 because of the neglect these historic structures have endured.\nIn collaboration with Kelly Quinn from UMD’s Department of American Studies, MITH staff assisted with the creation of a website, Learning from Langston Terrace, which sought to commemorate the history of the community by compiling and offering primary sources for visitors. The materials on the site were meant to augment user’s experiences and memories of Langston and the scholarly literature.\n",

    "description": "Foreign Literatures in America (FLA) is a project devoted to the recovery and understanding of the significance of foreign authored literary works, as well as immigrant authored literary works, in the U.S. throughout U.S. history.\nOur principal mission is to challenge conceptions of “American literature” that turn upon the American citizenship of an author—when historically it is clear that foreign authored works, as well as works by immigrant authors who wrote in many languages and were not citizens of the United States, have long profoundly constituted an important part of the literatures and cultures of the U.S.\nThis project thus seeks to offer many fresh opportunities to globalize the terms through which we understand American literature and American culture, both of these domains rediscovered as richly constituted and interpenetrated by global texts, concerns, contexts, voices.\nFLA pursues these goals by offering various means of studying the reception of foreign and immigrant authored literary works in the U.S., in interdisciplinary terms that encompass literature, culture, politics, history, and international relations.\n**Archival resources: **The project offers extensive archival resources of primary reception materials (i.e., accounts of “foreign” authors and works in newspapers, magazines, images, rarer archives, etc.) accessible in themselves, browsable in useful arrays, and searchable and subject to certain forms of quantitative analysis by nuanced means.\n**Laboratories:** The project develops laboratories based on cutting edge tools of machine learning drawn from recent digital humanities innovations in the areas of topics modeling and sentiment analysis; these laboratories allow users to mine large databases of “big data” already assembled for meaningful patterns and insights of literary reception.\n**Book review pages:** The project assembles its own smaller databases of book review pages from various U.S. newspapers and periodicals over time (beginning with the New York Times, The New Republic, and The Crisis), subject not only to the kind of searching and quantitative techniques of analysis found in the archival and laboratory sections, but also to comparative quantification of the most frequently mentioned authors in user-determined time frames and periodical ranges—(these book review pages thus become a powerful means of recovering forgotten literary and cultural history).\n**Collective Forum:** FLA is a committedly and internationally a collective forum for research, innovation, discussion, and collaboration, one in which blogging and various forms of collective interchange, suggestion, and crowd-sourced cooperation are facilitated—both as concerns all the research functions described above, and also toward innovation of further functions FLA could undertake.\nBeyond the general aims and specific outcomes noted above, there are two specific aims of this project that should be emphasized. First, in the shorter term, rather than do full comprehensive justice to any one of the functions described above, we are really trying to “open the door” with respect to them all, encouraging different teams of faculty and student researches both at the University of Maryland and around the country and world to develop dynamic possibilities for this project.\nAnyone interested in the kind of scholarly and analytic priorities foregrounded by the project is most warmly encouraged to contact us with your ideas and to join our project. The second point is more long term: though this project does aim to offer the means for a wholesale remapping of American literary studies (what this domain consists of, which voices and texts, why they are important), it is also a project of significance not only among university and academic research communities but also in larger social domains of education as well—including not only secondary schools and undergraduate pedagogy and also those interested in non-traditional education forms in our culture and society generally.\nThis general goal of making a productive globalizing contribution to American education in the broadest possible terms is an ultimate aspiration for this project.\n_The technological infrastructure for this project has been supported in part by a generous grant from [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/)._\n",

    "description": "“O Say Can You See”: the Early Washington, D.C. Law and Family Project explores multi-generational black and white family networks in early Washington, D.C., by collecting, digitizing, making accessible, and analyzing over 4,000 case files from the D.C. court from 1808 to 1815, records of Md. courts, and related documents about these families. Scholars from the University of Maryland and the University of Nebraska will collaborate by uncovering the web of litigants, jurists, legal actors, and participants in this community, and by placing these family networks in the foreground of our interpretive framework of slavery and national formation. Focusing first on the landmark 1813 case Queen v. Hepburn, one of the earliest petitions for freedom from slavery heard by the U.S. Supreme Court, and a foundational case establishing the hearsay rule, the project will document the relationships within and among black and white families in early D.C. at the center of these cases, host virtual seminars to refine our methods, and produce a series of studies in monograph and article form.\n",

The project is an extension of the book, _Black Gotham: A Family History of African Americans in Nineteenth-Century New York City_ (Yale UP, 2011), written by Carla Peterson, Ph.D., Project Director, MITH Faculty Fellow and professor of English at the University of Maryland. The Archive incorporates various new media forms to enable greater flexibility, interactivity, and potential for reaching a broader audience.\nThe Black Gotham Digital Archive launched in May 2012.\n",

        "description": "I’ve spent my MITH fellowship year working on “The Black Gotham Digital Archive.” My goal is to link an interactive web site, smart phones, and the geographic spaces of Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn to create a deeper understanding of nineteenth-century black New York. The project is an extension of my book, _Black Gotham: A Family History of African Americans in Nineteenth-Century New York City _(Yale UP, 2011), and is motivated by my search for new media forms that will allow greater flexibility, interactivity, and potential for reaching a broader audience.\nI structured my book around two principal concepts. The first was chronology, in which I took family history as a starting point to construct a broader social and cultural history of New York City’s black elite from about 1805 to 1895. The second was social geography, in which I illustrated the myriad ways in which members of the black elite inhabited Gotham, emphasizing how, in contrast to the all too familiar Harlem model, nineteenth-century black New Yorkers lived throughout the entire city, in different wards and neighborhoods.\nMy digital archive is structured around the same conceptual principles, but it relies on a different form of storytelling, one which inverts the relationship between text and image. In my book, word was the primary vehicle for telling my story and image functioned as supporting illustration; in the digital archive, image is the primary vehicle and word supporting document. Throughout the year, I’ve been working with MITH staff member Seth Denbo to implement this storytelling principle. Using Omeka as a platform, we have created a series of exhibits based on images, maps with clickable icons, narrative and descriptive text with links to ancillary material (manuscript material, newspaper accounts, books, collections, etc). The result is a greater sense of simultaneity (different historical actors doing different things at same time), mobility (movement through the streets of New York), and audience interactivity.\nIn the next phase of my project, I encourage further interactivity in at least two ways. The first is the creation of smart phone walking tours that will enable visitors to my archive to download an app that uses real-time geo-location information to provide them with targeted content from it; they can visit the neighborhoods discussed in the archive, view the locations of places mentioned, see images in context, and read the information provided. The second is to create a feature that will allow viewers to add their own stories to “The Black Gotham Digital Archive” and thus enhance our knowledge base of the social and cultural history of black New Yorkers in the nineteenth century.\n",

    "description": "The University of Maryland's [Center for the History of the New America](http://www.newamerica.umd.edu/) (CHNA) has partnered with MITH to develop the Transforming the Afro-Caribbean World (TAW) project to bring together scholars of the Panama Canal, Afro-Caribbean history, and experts in the digital humanities, data modeling, and visualization for a two-day planning workshop that will discuss a large-scale effort to explore Afro-Caribbean labor, migration, and the Panama Canal.\nThe U.S. project to construct the Panama Canal exerted a huge impact on the Americas, generating a tidal flow of migration from dozens of nations to the Panama Canal Zone in the early 20th century---and then beyond it to sites across the hemisphere, permanently altering the geography, economy, politics, and cultures of the Western Hemisphere.\nThe TAW workshop has several aims: 1) digitization of a subset of the proposed records to evaluate potential costs and preservation issues; 2) exploration of structured data tools to reveal new insights about these records; 3) the creation of annotated bibliographies for use by teachers and the public as they begin to explore the centennial anniversary of the opening of the canal; and 4) identification of other archives and repositories to be included in a larger project. Ultimately this start-up grant will produce a work plan and report outlining a potential large-scale collaboration to map and explore the movement of Afro-Caribbean laborers between 1903 and 1920.\n",

    "description": "Tanya Clement and Doug Reside led a workshop on professionalization in digital humanities centers called, “Off the Tracks—Laying New Lines for Digital Humanities Scholars.” The workshop addressed the rapidly emerging phenomenon of alternative academic careers among the hybrid scholar-programmers now staffing many DH centers. Such staff members are not well accounted for by the normative division between the “research” usually associated with faculty positions and the “service” usually associated with staff. As a result, career trajectories and methods for their professional development are unclear. This Digital Humanities Level 1 Start Up grant supported a MITH-hosted two-day workshop during January 2011. The online discussion resulted in a white paper and a set of recommendations for establishing career paths within digital humanities centers.\n\nPlease cite the \"Collaborators' Bill of Rights\" as: Clement, Tanya E., Douglas Reside, Brian Croxall, Julia Flanders, Neil Fraistat, Steve Jones, Matt Kirschenbaum, Suzanne Lodato, Laura Mandell, Paul Marty, David Miller, Bethany Nowviskie, Stephen Olsen, Tom Scheinfeldt, David Seaman, Mark Tebeau, John Unsworth, Kay Walter. “Collaborators’ Bill of Rights.” In _Off the Tracks: Laying New Lines for Digital Humanities Scholars_, by Tanya E.

        "description": "Tanya Clement and Doug Reside led a workshop on professionalization in digital humanities centers called, “Off the Tracks—Laying New Lines for Digital Humanities Scholars.” The workshop addressed the rapidly emerging phenomenon of alternative academic careers among the hybrid scholar-programmers now staffing many DH centers. Such staff members are not well accounted for by the normative division between the “research” usually associated with faculty positions and the “service” usually associated with staff. As a result, career trajectories and methods for their professional development are unclear. This Digital Humanities Level 1 Start Up grant supported a MITH-hosted two-day workshop during January 2011. The online discussion resulted in a white paper and a set of recommendations for establishing career paths within digital humanities centers.\n",

Extending the use of Anthologize—a free and open source plug‐in for WordPress that currently translates any RSS text into PDF, ePub, HTML, or TEI—MITH and the BrailleSC team will develop braille output for the tool.\nAs a result, BrailleSC will not only make it easy for content creators to convert a text into braille, thereby extending humanities content to hundreds of thousands of visually disabled readers, but will also experiment with making braille available visually through the WordPress interface.\n",

    "description": "Digital Mishnah will create a digital edition of the Mishnah, a Jewish legal treatise from roughly 200 CE. An artifact of great significance to cultural, religious, and social history, this text manifests itself in several forms dating roughly from the eleventh to the fifteenth century, including a significant 1492 printed edition. Led by Hayim Lapin, Ph.D., Robert H. Smith Professor of Jewish Studies and professor of History at the University of Maryland, the project will encode the text in TEI, in order to provide a research tool for the collation and comparison of text. Additionally, the database will include targeted searching, transcriptions, and an annotated translation for a wider audience.\n_The technological infrastructure for this project has been supported in part by a generous grant from [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/)._\n",

The goal was to construct a significant scholarly online resource for studying John Milton’s _A Maske_, familiarly known as _Comus_. The choice of this particular work was made due to its various interpretations and forms (text, hypertext, pictoral and musical). The site consists of four core content sections: a textual archive, multimedia representations, critical essays, and a bibliography.\nThe project was also sponsored by Dr. Sharon Achinstein as an independent study, and assisted by MITH consultants George Williams and Jason Rhody. Eric White and Chris Bowling provided image scanning and digital image editing work for the project as well.\n",

    "description": "Preserving Virtual Worlds II: Methods for Evaluating and Preserving Significant Properties of Educational Games and Complex Interactive Environments (PVW2) was conducted in partnership with the University of Illinois (lead institution), the Rochester Institute of Technology, and Stanford University. The goals of PVW2 were to help improve the capacity of libraries, museums, and archives to preserve computer games, virtual worlds, and interactive fiction. The work was funded by a $785,000 National Leadership Grant awarded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services.\nMITH’s research team played a major role in all aspects of the new project, including content analysis work, interviews with game players and producers, and conducting double-blind studies to help evaluate the “significant properties” of games and other interactive media. PVW2 was a novel methodology for studying the significant properties of video games and other complex interactive environments. By focusing on the temporal transitions between developer versions and player mods, PVW2 identified patterns of stability and change in game attributes–such as graphics, text, sound, items, and sprites–in order to help infer how different communities of practice interpret their relative significance.\n",

        "description": "A number of cultural institutions have begun to take an interest in videogame preservation — but before materials make it to the archives, they are managed by their creators. Understanding what the videogame industry itself is doing with the concept art, tools, and other records they create is an important step to ensure that these increasingly important artifacts are preserved for future generations. In this talk, Rachel Donahue, doctoral student at the iSchool, will discuss her findings from a preliminary survey of videogame industry (and player community) preservation and records management practices.\n",

    "description": "Unlocking the Airwaves: Revitalizing an Early Public and Educational Radio Collection is a multi-institutional collaboration between MITH, the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://commarts.wisc.edu/), the [Wisconsin Historical Society](https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/), [University Libraries](http://www.lib.umd.edu/) at the University of Maryland, with collaborative support from the [American Archive of Public Broadcasting](http://americanarchive.org/) at WGBH/Library of Congress, and the [Radio Preservation Task Force](https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-recording-preservation-plan/about-this-program/radio-preservation-task-force/). The project is funded by a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), and is being directed at MITH by [Stephanie Sapienza](https://www.stephaniesapienza.com/) with UW-Madison Co-PI [Eric Hoyt.](http://erichoyt.org/)\nThe goal of the project is to create a comprehensive online collection of early educational public radio content from the National Association of Educational Broadcasters (NAEB). The forerunner of CPB and its arms, NPR and PBS, the NAEB served as the primary organizer, developer, and distributor for noncommercial broadcast production and analysis between 1925 and 1981. These broadcasts, mostly stemming from university and public school-run radio stations, provide an in-depth look at the engagements and events of American history, as they were broadcast to and received by the general public in the twentieth century. According to the project's Lead Advisor, Josh Shepperd of Catholic University and Director of the Radio Preservation Task Force:\n_\"The National Association of Educational Broadcasters recordings provide valuable context into cultural, political, and less-studied, educational discourses going back to the New Deal, and associated documents help media scholars to trace the origin of script development, audience research, and genres that we associate with both public media and cable television---science, travel, food, history, and journalism programming.\"_\nThe NAEB systematically preserved its history across over a hundred boxes of documents and 5,000 reels of tape, but the organization split its archive, depositing its papers in Wisconsin and the recordings in Maryland. Archival audiovisual media has been collected and maintained separately from other kinds of (primarily textual) archival sources, and these 'split' collections mean that researchers must often discover and manually reunite audiovisual collections and their related materials if they want to understand a broadcast not just as an audiovisual object, but as a medium that relays information within a set of historical contexts (time, place, related events, etc.). Unlocking the Airwaves will reunite the split NAEB collections, develop an open and comprehensive web portal for them, and tell the story of early educational and public broadcasting.\nBy coordinating the expertise of archivists, humanities researchers, and digital humanists, Unlocking the Airwaves will deliver enhanced access to important, mostly hidden, archival audiovisual materials by linking split hybrid paper/audiovisual collections together, and providing a search engine for the linked collections, enabling users to simultaneously search both the documents and sounds of the NAEB. The resulting resource will finally realize the potential of the collections of the NAEB for exploration and study by educators, scholars, journalists, documentarians, genealogists, and the broader public.\n",

    "description": "In January of 2013, the National Endowment of the Humanities (NEH) began a project to digitize all of its early grant records from the 1960's and 1970's. These records were stored on old punch-cards known as McBee edge-notched cards. Their goal was to get all these cards entered into a grants database by 2015, which was the NEH's 50th anniversary. In September of 2015, the NEH completed and announced the project. For the first time ever, the public could search for any grant the NEH had ever made. _Time_ magazine ran a story in which they featured ten of the old McBee cards.\nOne of these cards described a grant to Andy van Dam at Brown University in 1974. The title was \"An Experiment in Computer Based Education Using Hypertext.\" The brief description on the card simply said:\n_To support an experimental program to teach a college-level English poetry course, utilizing a new form of computer based \"manuscript,\" called a hypertext. A documentary film about the project is being produced. An evaluation is being performed to determine the usefulness of this technique as an aid to humanities education._\nThe short film that resulted is an early and remarkable document of the kind of collaboration between humanities scholars and students and computer scientists that is increasingly commonplace in the field known as Digital Humanities. It has not been shown in public since its making.\nThe Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities and the [Human-Computer Interaction Lab](http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/about/) at the University of Maryland, and the [National Endowment for the Humanities](http://www.neh.gov/divisions/odh) cordially invite you to its first public screening at **7:30pm on the evening of Monday April 25, 2016** in the auditorium at 0320 Tawes Hall. The screening will include commentary on this experiment, which built arguably the first online scholarly community, by Professor van Dam, followed by a panel discussion featuring van Dam as well as Maryland's own Ben Shneiderman, Kari Kraus (Associate Professor, iSchool and English Department), the NEH's CIO and Director of the Office of Digital Humanities Brett Bobley, and NEH's Program Analyst Ann Sneesby-Koch (to be moderated by MITH's Associate Director Matthew Kirschenbaum).\nWe hope that you can join us for this very special event!\n_Andy Van Dam will also be joining us for a special Digital Dialogue talk the following Tuesday afternoon, April 26th.

    "description": "Enhancing Music Notation Addressability (EMA) originates from the idea that music notation, like text, can be \"addressed\" in new ways in a digital environment, allowing scholars to identify and name structures of various kinds. However, how can one virtually \"circle\" music notation? and how can a machine interpret this \"circling\" to retrieve music notation?\nTo research these questions, we are teaming up with the [Du Chemin: Lost Voices](http://digitalduchemin.org/) project (Haverford College), which is reconstructing songs printed by Nicholas Du Chemin between 1549 and 1568 in Paris. We will work on music analyses already produced by students and scholars as part of the Du Chemin project and re-model them as Linked Open Data nanopublications.\nIn the sciences, nanopublication is providing the research community with ways of managing attribution and documenting quality of even small contributions. The nanopublication model facilitates accurate citation and promotes massively collaborative scholarship. We seek to extend these benefits to humanities scholarship.\nEach EMA nanopublication will address an arbitrary portion of music notation encoded according to the [Music Encoding Initiative](http://music-encoding.org/home) (MEI) format. To support these addressing acts, we will develop a prototype application able to return a meaningful selection of encoded music notation.\n",

    "description": "African American History, Culture and Digital Humanities (AADHum) was awarded to the [College of Arts and Humanities](http://www.arhu.umd.edu/) (ARHU) and is being co-directed by MITH and the [Arts and Humanities Center for Synergy](http://arhusynergy.umd.edu/) (Center for Synergy). The project was funded by a $1.25 million grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation for research, education and training at the intersections of digital humanities and African American studies, and will help to prepare a diverse community of scholars and students whose work will both broaden the reach of the digital humanities in African American history and cultural studies, and enrich humanities research with new methods, archives and tools.\nAADHum is built upon two of the University of Maryland's areas of internationally recognized excellence: African American history and cultural studies and digital humanities. The proposed project aims to strengthen both of these fields and offer new knowledge and understanding to scholars, students, cultural heritage professionals, and the public. African American history and cultural studies offers a broad landscape of research questions and archival collections relating to race and racialization that have not yet been widely engaged by the digital humanities. The thematic focus of the project, African American labor, migration and artistic expression, incorporates the broad intellectual interests shared by a large group of prominent scholars, students and staff on campus, and represents some of the campus's greatest strengths. Specific research projects will be undertaken in collaboration with [The Center for the History of the New America](http://newamerica.umd.edu/), which houses the Archive of Immigrant Voices; [The David C. Driskell Center for the Study of Visual Art and Culture of African Americans and the African Diaspora](http://www.driskellcenter.umd.edu/) with its collection of over 50,000 objects that chronicle the development and understanding of the study of African American visual culture; and the UMD libraries' recently acquired [George Meany Memorial AFL-CIO Archive](http://www.lib.umd.edu/special/collections/afl-cio), a preeminent research collection for the study of American labor history.\nAADHum will operate as a catalyst and a connector for scholars while providing concrete training and tools to project personnel, the wider UMD campus, and other institutions. The project will apply MITH's [Digital Humanities Incubator](../digital-humanities-incubator-2012-13/index.html) model to introduce scholars, students and cultural heritage professionals to new modes of research through a series of workshops, tutorials and detailed consultations. The goal of the Incubator framework is to organize the high-level training intended to acculturate scholars, students, and librarians to new modes of research, collaboration, and publishing across projects. The project team will work with the Driskell Center, CHNA, and the Meany Archives to identify small datasets from those collections focused on immigration and labor as testbeds for the initial Incubator, which will prepare the ground for such work by cultivating and vetting research questions that arise as our the collections are made tractable to digital tools and methods.\nThe Center for Synergy will provide an interdisciplinary bridge between departments and centers and facilitate the public facing events, curricular initiatives and websites connected with the project. This includes graduate and undergraduate courses, summer institutes for faculty to diversify and transform curricula, and themed seminar and speaker series.\n\n**Photo Credits:** \"Five generations on Smith's plantation, Beaufort, South Carolina\", Timothy O'Sullivan, 1862---Prints and Photographs Division, Library of Congress. _Power and Purpose_, 2008, Paper pulp painting, 49.5 x 97″, © 2013 Preston Sampson. 500 Laborers from Barbados/Deck Scene, September 2, 1909, Panama; NARA identification number 185-G-1128.\n",

This convening of African Americanists and Digital Humanities scholars from around the greater Washington D.C. region is designed to generate lively conversations about opportunities to utilize new methods, archives and tools of the Digital Humanities to ask and answer intriguing questions in African American history and cultural studies, as well as ways to broaden the reach of the Digital Humanities in these areas.\nDuring this half-day meeting participants will learn about the range of research materials available to them at Maryland for the study of African American life. They will later break into subgroups and start to identifyto generate questions that touch on the thematic focus of the project, including African American labor, migration and artistic expression.\nJoin featured speaker Mariët Westerman, vice president of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, and colleagues from across the greater Washington D.C. region to learn how you can play a part in this major new initiative.\nThe event is free and we’re asking that you [register online](https://www.arhu.umd.edu/DHAAHCForm) by Friday, May 5.

        "description": "What happens to digital humanities inquiry when we begin with Black culture, Black thought, and Black persons at the center of our endeavors? How does this shift challenge and expand both the humanities and the digital? What happens to Black and African American humanities research when we lead with the digital?\nInterdisciplinary inquiry into both the online practices of black users and humanities research focused on black history and culture using digital tools has expanded in the past decade. Too often, this work happens on the margins of established disciplines, boundaries, and paradigms. Rather than arriving at black digital research as an afterthought or a tactic to achieve “diversity”, privileging black theory and black culture in our scholarship can provide alternate paradigms through which to understand the digital and the humanistic.\nThe first national conference of the African American Digital Humanities (AADHum) Initiative at the University of Maryland will explore how digital studies and digital humanities-based research, teaching, and community projects can center African American history and culture. AADHum invites submissions that may include scholarly inquiry into Black diasporic and African American uses of digital technologies; digital humanities projects that focus on black history and culture; race and digital theory; the intersection of black studies and digital humanities; information studies, cultural heritage, and community-based digital projects; pedagogical interventions; digital tools and artifacts; black digital humanities and memory; social media and black activism/movements, etc.\n",

    "description": "The Bill Bly Collection of Electronic Literature is a rich archive of materials from the early literary hypertext movement, received as a generous donation to MITH directly from Bill Bly. Together with the existing [Deena Larsen Collection](http://mith.umd.edu/larsen/), also housed at MITH, these two collections position MITH as a major center of study for anyone interested in primary source materials–both manuscript and born-digital–from this unique moment in literary and technological history.\nBly’s collection includes numerous exemplars of hypertext fiction and poetry collected over the years, as well as his own notes and variations for _We Descend_, his ongoing hyper-fiction, the first volume of which was published by Eastgate Systems in 1997. The collection is particularly rich in materials related to the early Macintosh software HyperCard, used as the platform for dozens of works of early electronic literature.\nMITH Associate Director Matthew Kirschenbaum says “We at MITH see Bill’s gift as a _living archive_, to be accessed, explored, and enjoyed as openly as possible by students and researchers. We will be working to catalog and describe the materials, and we welcome anyone with an interest in exploring the history of hypertext to contact us about a visit.”\n",

    "description": "Led by the [Digital Library Federation](https://www.diglib.org/), Endangered Data Week, February 26 -- March 2, 2018, is an international, collaborative effort, coordinated across campuses, nonprofits, libraries, citizen science initiatives, and cultural heritage institutions, to shed light on public datasets that are in danger of being deleted, repressed, mishandled, or lost. The goals of Endangered Data Week are to promote care for endangered collections by publicizing the availability of datasets; increasing critical engagement with them, including through visualization and analysis; and by encouraging political activism for open data policies and the fostering of data skills through workshops on curation, documentation and discovery, improved access, and preservation.\nPartnering with [University of Maryland Libraries](http://www.lib.umd.edu/), MITH hosted a roundtable to illuminate threats as well as ethical questions and best practices for working with endangered cultural heritage data. A hands-on workshop followed the panel, highlighting specific tools and approaches for preserving data.\n",

We intend this panel to move between a “10,000 ft view” and bespoke practices spun out of experience and care of data. We are particularly interested in how we move to identify our responsibilities and what, as Haraway ([link](https://umaryland.on.worldcat.org/oclc/940935960)) suggests, our response abilities towards the threats to cultural, scientific, and government data.\n",

We intend this panel to move between a “10,000 ft view” and bespoke practices spun out of experience and care of data. We are particularly interested in how we move to identify our responsibilities and what, as Haraway ([link](https://umaryland.on.worldcat.org/oclc/940935960)) suggests, our response abilities towards the threats to cultural, scientific, and government data.\n",

    "description": "_Thu, Nov 2, 2017 _\n1:30 pm - 4:30 pm\nMITH Conference Room\nUnderstanding the contents of institutional and digital collections and their connections to other related material can be daunting. Increasingly researchers, institutions and a broader public can work together, using crowdsourcing and linked open to meaningfully enrich and connect collections.\nThis panel and workshop, planned in conjunction with the [2017 Radio Preservation Task Force Conference](https://radiopreservation.org/), will focus on innovative workflows for crowdsourcing linked data to build a web of data that can bridge collective heritage. Both researchers interested in learning to access more information about radio collections and collection managers will benefit from this cross-disciplinary event.\nPanelists will discuss their work and research in crowdsourcing or linked open data for radio collections. Subsequently, a two-hour workshop will introduce the core principles behind the data structure and framework for Wikidata, and demonstrate how it can be used to connect archival radio collections to a broader web-based community of knowledge.\n_Moderator:_ [Stephanie Sapienza](../../index.html%3Fp=11177.html) (​Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities)\n## Panelists\n[Alex Stinson](https://twitter.com/sadads) (Wikimedia Foundation) will highlight how Wikidata is being used by diverse cultural heritage organizations around the world, including by the Archive of the Finnish Public Radio organization (Yle), the Social Network of Archival Collections (SNAC), and by other heritage organizations as diverse as the Metropolitan Museum and university libraries working to make their collections better connected with the world of linked open data through Wikidata.\n[Casey Davis Kaufman](https://twitter.com/CaseyEDavis1) and [Karen Cariani](https://twitter.com/kcariani) (WGBH Boston/American Archive for Public Broadcasting) will showcase the their IMLS-funded crowdsourcing project FIX IT, an online game that allows members of the public to help AAPB professional archivists improve the searchability and accessibility of more than 40,000 hours of digitized, historic public media content.\n[Eric Hoyt](https://twitter.com/HoytEric) (University of Wisconsin-Madison) will reflect on his work developing the Media History Digital Library's search platform, Lantern, and data mining application, Arclight. He will also discuss methods that users can use to translate their data into new queries and interpret and share the results.\n[Effie Kapsalis](https://twitter.com/digitaleffie) (Smithsonian Institution Archives): will share the Smithsonian Institution Archives' (SIA) methods for enriching and sharing their collections through crowdsourcing, with a particular focus on the institutional challenges of implementing such projects. Since 2005, SIA experimented with publishing minimum metadata about little-known women in the history of science, and recruiting constituents on various platforms (blogs, institutional websites, Flickr Commons, Wikipedia, Smithsonian Transcription Center) to fill in the 'unknowns.' These experiments have led to rich collections records on the Smithsonian's websites, complete Wikipedia articles, and improved digital resources on female scientists for the public. Today SIA is leading a pan-Smithsonian pilot to make a large contribution to Wikidata.\n## Workshop\nIn the workshop, we will provide a basic introduction to Wikidata and then use Wikidata to develop more robust context for an archival radio collection. We will connect Wikidata with authority records pulled from descriptive metadata about the National Association of Educational Broadcasters (NAEB) collection at the University of Maryland/American Archive of Public Broadcasting. We will use that linked data to demonstrate visualizations and other potential applications of Wikidata for research, including unearthing other authority records and digital web resources about people, places, and other entities, showing network relationships between various metadata items, and asking questions to better understand the context of the collection.\n### About Wikidata\nA sister project of Wikipedia, Wikidata is a human and machine readable platform that allows for crowdsourcing to enrich metadata and access linked open data content from free and open vocabularies and data projects, such as the Getty vocabularies, the Social Network of Archival Content (SNAC), and others. Wikidata maintains many of the dynamics of the widely popular encyclopedia: it's free and open, editorial decisions are made by the community participating in the project, and the content is multilingual, supporting hundreds of languages.\n## Videos\n<iframe title=\"vimeo-player\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/242802386\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<iframe title=\"vimeo-player\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/242802386\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n",

We are particularly interested, through this meeting and through follow on activities, in topics such as broadening the constituencies for black digital collections, ownership and agency in shared collections, as well as beginning and sustaining collaborations.\n[View Report](https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:21919/)\n",

Deena is an author and new media visionary who has been active in the creative electronic writing community nearly since its inception in the 1980s. In addition to being a writer and thinker, Deena has also been a collector and an amateur archivist (or, as we say of amateurs, a hoarder). Collecting and hoarding, it turns out, are very important activities, since too few of our cultural institutions and repositories are yet engaged with acquiring and saving the rich and various creative legacy we have inherited from the first generation of personal computing. The arrival of Deena’s collection at MITH furnishes us with invaluable source material which will further both our in-house research in digital curation and preservation, as well as function as a primary resource for researchers interested in early hypertext and electronic literature.\n",

        "description": "In May of 2007, MITH received the extraordinary gift of Deena Larsen's personal collection of early-era personal computers and software. Deena is an author and new media visionary who has been active in the creative electronic writing community nearly since its inception in the 1980s. In addition to being a writer and thinker, Deena has also been a collector and an amateur archivist (or, as we say of amateurs, a hoarder). Collecting and hoarding, it turns out, are very important activities, since too few of our cultural institutions and repositories are yet engaged with acquiring and saving the rich and various creative legacy we have inherited from the first generation of personal computing. The arrival of Deena's collection at MITH furnishes us with invaluable source material which will further both our in-house research in digital curation and preservation, as well as function as a primary resource for researchers interested in early hypertext and electronic literature. This talk will introduce the collection to the MITH community, and discuss future research agendas. We intend a wide-ranging conversation, from the practicalities and ethics of preservation to the implications of born-digital material for textual and editorial theory.\nThis talk will introduce the collection to the MITH community, and discuss future research agendas.

    "description": "The Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) standard is used by scholars to encode texts of many kinds, from manuscript transcriptions, to historical documents, linguistic corpora, and audio transcripts. For this reason, the vast standard is typically _customized_ before being used in a specific project (see our customization for the Shelley-Godwin Archive).\nThe TEI can be customized using the XML vocabulary from a dedicated module of the TEI (called ODD). To simplify this process, TEI users have relied for years on a dedicated PHP online tool called Roma. Raff Viglianti is rewriting this tool as a React/Redux web application to modernize the user experience, expand the features of the tool, and improve its chances for long term use and preservation.\nVisit the tool's GitHub repository (in the 'Links' section) to see previews and report issues.\n",
