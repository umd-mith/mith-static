    "bio": "Kimberly Bain is a Ph.D. Candidate in English and Interdisciplinary Humanistic Study at Princeton University. Kimberly's most pressing intellectual interests include the history, theory, and philosophy of: diaspora, race, gender, postcolonialism, enslavement, flesh, environmental racism, resistance, embodiment, and subjection and subjecthood. Her dissertation, entitled \"On Black Breath: A Theory and Praxis\", takes seriously the charge of \"I can't breathe\" and considers breath as more than the mere metaphor---rather, as also a somatic and sociopolitical phenomenon that has resonances in the wake of enslavement to the contemporary moment. Kimberly is affiliated with the American Studies Program, Department of African-American Studies, and the Center for Digital Humanities. More information about her current work can be found at kimbain.com. \n",

She is also a member of the Immersive Realities Lab for the Humanities (irLh).\nFocusing on digitality’s place in Black and American life, she explores how digital technologies stretch and remodel the present limits of storytelling and memorialization, warp time, shrink space, and democratize resources. She remains attuned to the ways it can reproduce marginalization and obstruct access in the United States. As a result, she feels called to helping create digital tools that are equitable and humanistic at its core.\nPrior to joining the team, Christin was a Community Partnerships Associate at DonorsChoose, an edtech company that provides learning materials to public school students across the United States. Christin is an alumna of Amherst College where she received a B.A. with the highest distinction in Black Studies and Political Science.\n",

    "bio": "Jason Scott is a computer historian and documentary filmmaker who has been collecting, archiving and presenting computer history for over 20 years. Most of his collections can be seen online at the site [textfiles.com](textfiles.com), which began as a small archive of 1980s computer bulletin board history and has expanded to over fifty years of documents and artifacts. Besides presenting at computer conferences and other events, Jason has also shot two documentaries, _BBS The Documentary_ and _Get Lamp_, the second of which covers the text adventure game genre, a precursor to the modern games industry. An outspoken critic of poor data archiving and destruction of digital history, Jason co-founded Archive Team, an activist group of rogue archivists dedicated to saving digital history and gaining attention to the importance of the artifacts online communities. Improbably, he also works for the most popular cat on Twitter, @sockington, who has nearly a million and a half followers. \n",

Dr. Seales is developing and evaluating new techniques for digital acquisition, restoration, and visualization using real-world library collections with particular focus on preservation and dissemination. He is also the director of the STITCH project (Surgical Technology Integration with Tools for Cognitive Human Factors), which envisions a networked operating room of the future, where computers and surgical instruments are connected.

Her work wrestles with the societal and ideological tensions in defining freedom within the United States south during the nineteenth century. Specifically, her investigations highlight African American efforts toward cultural and political assertion in the Great Dismal Swamp region. Her focus also includes environmental impacts resulting from the extractive industries that originated in the Great Dismal Swamp alongside the exploitation of enslaved labor. Building on the work of archaeologists, historians, and novelists, her work maps (or rather counter maps) the experiences of enslaved runaways and laborers who were exposed to the Great Dismal Swamp and the long duree of the attendant political, social and environmental costs of human/landscape resource exploitation. \n",

She teaches and researches in the field of the digital humanities, focusing especially on applying digital methods mindfully within the context of visual and material culture studies. For the Department of Art History and Architecture, Alison serves as the Director of the Visual Media Workshop (VMW). The mission of the VMW is to develop and encourage the creation of innovative methods for producing, disseminating, and preserving the academic work using digital technologies as a fundamental component of our scholarly toolkit. To achieve these objectives, she directs a technologically-focused environment of collaboration and creativity where students and faculty from a number of departments across the University come together to work on projects that apply digital methods and techniques with focus and intention. For the School of Computing and Information (SCI), Alison researches the relationship between the historical practice of information management and digital computing, both as a historical narrative and also as a complex, changing process in contemporary America. This research, plus all of the theories, concepts, and models that she teaches at SCI, are put into daily practice in her work directing the VMW. In terms of teaching, Alison teaches courses in digital preservation and the digital humanities, especially, but not exclusively, at the graduate level.Alison is also the principal contact for the [DHRX: Digital Humanities Research at Pitt](www.dhrx.pitt.edu/) initiative, which represents a transdisciplinary network of scholars here at the University of Pittsburgh who use digital methods to study the ways in which humans interact with their environments, whether social or cultural, natural or human-created. \n",

He studied mathematics and philosophy at the University of Oxford, and started his career as a programmer before working for many years as a lecturer in software engineering at the University of Westminster. He then turned to the history of computing, gaining a PhD in science and technology studies from University College London. His previous book, A Science of Operations: Machines, Logic, and the Invention of Programming (Springer, 2011), explores the influence of logical ideas on the evolution of programming methods. Following on from ENIAC in Action (MIT 2016), he is working on recapturing the details of early programming ideas and practices in other contexts. More information is available at [his website](www.markpriestley.net). \n",

Lu earned her Ph.D. in Communication and Graduate Certificate in Women's Studies from the University of Maryland, College Park, where she now serves as the Associate Director of Design Cultures & Creativity (DCC) in the Honors College. Trained as a rhetorical critic, she is concerned with how we can practice greater care for past, present, and future humans---especially those whose lives are shaped by precarity and state-sanctioned violence---in the ways we use language to create, design, and destroy our worlds. She examines, in particular, the ideas and rhetorical practices that form, advance, and disrupt racist logics in public discourse in the United States. Her work is further positioned at the intersections of African American history, archives, and digital humanities, as she specializes in adapting the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) standard of scholarly markup to critically model, analyze, and amplify Black people's practices of rhetorical invention and innovation. \n",

That is, her research has a decidedly social justice centered purpose and end goal. Her research interests include histories of Black education, Black women’s higher education, activist scholars, Black Feminisms. She is most interested in historical and contemporary issues of equity, agency, and thriving in education. In her dissertation research for example, she used oral history methodology to explore the organizing and activism experiences of Black women who attended a Southeastern historically Black university during the Civil Rights/Black Power Era. Such scholarship provides valuable information and possibilities for current organizers and activists.\nTurner holds a Ph.D. in Education Policy, Organization & Leadership with a concentration in History of Education from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and degrees from Fayetteville State University (B.A. History) and Fayetteville Technical Community College (A.A.S. Respiratory Care, General Education).\n",

Max is broadly interested in the political aesthetics of maintenance in environmental and technical systems, from the repair of material infrastructures to the moderation of internet discourse. Max received an MA in historical studies from the New School for Social Research and repairs computers in their free time. \n",

By using a wide range of computational tools and techniques, ranging from text encoding to text mining and visualization, Clement's project is a bracing demonstration of just how completely our readings and understandings of complex literary work can be reconfigured with the intervention of new media. \n",

But for someone who spends the majority of his time analyzing ancient and medieval artifacts, he also embraces social media and stresses its value even for the oldest, most established academic and cultural institutions. Noel believes passionately that institutions should free their digital data.\nSince 1999 Noel has spearheaded the conservation of a manuscript known as the [Archimedes Palimpsest](http://archimedespalimpsest.org/). The palimpsest is a unique Byzantine prayer book made up of parchments which contain hidden writings from three original previously-unknown texts: treatises written by Archimedes; works by the 4th-century B.C. Attic Orator Hyperides; and 3rd-century commentary on Aristotle’s _Categories_, by an unknown author. Using a powerful particle accelerator Noel and his team were able to uncover the hidden texts and publish all their images and findings on the Internet, available to anyone for free under a Creative Commons license.\nNoel currently lives in Baltimore, Maryland, where he curates at the Walters, working to ensure that the public has free digital access to his collection.\n",

He is a Ph.D. candidate in Women's Studies at the University of Maryland, College Park. Avery received his BA (2010) in English from the [University of Alabama](english.ua.edu/), Tuscaloosa, and his MA (2012) in American Studies from [the University of Kansas](americanstudies.ku.edu/). His work has appeared in the _Journal of Language and Sexuality_, _Critical Studies in Media Communication_, and _TSQ: Transgender Studies Quarterly_, and he served as Assistant Editor of _[AMSJ: American Studies](https://journals.ku.edu/index.php/amerstud)_ from 2010 to 2012. His research interests include new media, sociolinguistics, gender and transgender studies, and discourse analysis. While at UMD, his dissertation work _Talk Amongst Yourselves: Conceptions of \"Community\" in Transgender Counterpublic Discourse Online, 1990 -- 2014_, explores the affective and structural meanings assigned to \"community\" in English-language transgender discourse online. Drawing on a variety of historic and contemporary sites, he analyzes how users past and present construct \"transgender community\" in discourse---constructions shaped by different platform-specific affordances. His MITH project focuses on building a searchable archive of two major transgender Usenet groups, alt.transgendered and soc.support.transgender, amongst the few archival sites where the term \"cisgender\" is used. Avery's teaching also brings his focus on technology into the classroom. He has developed student projects focused on adding coverage for underrepresented subjects and groups on Wikipedia; You can see some of his students' pages [highlighted by the Wiki Education Foundation here](https://wikiedu.orgblog/2015/03/09/the-roundup-women-and-art-part-2/). He has also led Game Design workshops for the Design Cultures & Creativity program at UMD. \n",

    "bio": "Alexandrina is a game designer, community-based researcher, and media artist who believes in the possibilities of the decolonial imaginary using digital media as an emancipatory tool. She is an Assistant Professor of Interactive Media and Game Development at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. Her most recent game, _The Resisters_, was an alternate reality game she designed through participatory research with young people of color about local social movement history in Providence, RI. Before joining WPI, she earned her Ph.D. from the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism at the University of Southern California and an M.A. from the [College of Ethnic Studies](ethnicstudies.sfsu.edu/) at San Francisco State University---the only autonomous institution of its kind in the United States---where she researched adolescent girls of color and their race and gender identity development through online doll play. Alexandrina blends her knowledge of the digital with an aesthetic sense of tactile design; some of her past work includes designing a collection of dresses made entirely from recycled goods as a benefit for a cancer wellness nonprofit. Alexandrina utilizes principles of self-determination and relevant education in her teaching and research. She teaches at university and high school levels, and specializes in digital media skill building with young people of color. She is a co-chair of Situated Critical Race + Media (SCR+M!) of [FemTechNet](femtechnet.org), a multi-university collaborative feminist technology organization. She is the Futurist for the Latinx Pacific Archive and is working on developing a line of ovulation-tracking jewelry that is both affordable and flawlessly stylish. As a community-based researcher and participatory designer, her speculative work is still anchored in lived experience. She works closely with [New Urban Arts](newurbanarts.org), a youth art studio and imagination incubator. Alexandrina uses critical pedagogy and community-based research as platforms to work with institutions, community organizations, researchers, and artists. Her research has received funding from the National Science Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation-John E. Sawyer Seminars, the Teagle Foundation, the Rhode Island Council of the Humanities, and the Voqal Fund. \n",

Donald supports the [Games for Learning Institute](g4li.org), a consortium of 8 universities, 14 principal investigators, and a small army of graduate students whose mission is to explore what makes games fun, what makes them educational, and how to best blend the two goals. He is the Microsoft champion for the [Just Press Play](play.rit.edu/) project, an experiment to transform the undergraduate education of 750 students at Rochester Institute of Technology into a gameful narrative. Other projects include [Project Garibaldi](blogs.msdn.com/b/surface/archive/2010/04/27/experience-the-garibaldi-panorama-on-surface.aspx) and [Game Show NYC](www.gameshownyc.com/). Before joining MSR, Donald Brinkman served for two years as a technical program manager for the Microsoft education group. In that role he was responsible for defining vision of innovative business intelligence and analytics for education as well as driving a variety of enterprise-scale server capabilities. Prior to joining Microsoft he spent eight years in developmental and technical roles acquiring and executing government research contracts in areas such as quantum computation; signals intelligence; electromagnetic and kinetic simulations; behavioral economics; game theory; and cross-cultural communications. Donald is a writer, painter, game designer, and a passionate advocate of the benefits of building bridges between technical and humanist disciplines. He is particularly interested in disruptive technologies that leverage crowdsourcing, social computing, culture jamming, transmedia, and other non-traditional approaches.

Ms. Buchanan’s concerts have been described as “mesmerizing,” “insightful,” “exciting,” “inspiring,” and full of “flair, abandon, and color,” and her audiences have felt “transported,” “connected,” and “awed.” She has performed solo recitals throughout the U.S. and abroad, at such venues as the Instituto Brasileiro de Administracao Municipal (IBAM) in Rio de Janeiro, BRAZIL, the University of Guelph as well as Conrad Grebel University College in Ontario, CANADA, the Dame Myra Hess Memorial Concerts in Chicago, the Baltimore Museum of Art, and the Harvard University Hall Concert Series, among many others. Ms. Buchanan has been a guest soloist on many occasions, including performances for the Harvard Arts First festivals, the Harvard Music Department’s Composer Colloquium series, the Cicada Festival Emerging Artists Recital (Mount Gretna, PA), and as the guest concerto soloist with the Waynesboro Orchestra (Waynesboro, VA), conducted by Eric Stassen. In addition, Ms. Buchanan has given ensemble performances in New England Conservatory’s Jordan Hall, Harvard University, and at the New School of Music in Cambridge, MA.\nMs. Buchanan received her Master’s degree in piano performance from the New England Conservatory of Music, her Bachelor’s degree in music from the University of Virginia, and conducted three years of her music studies at the University of Iowa School of Music while pursuing an M.F.A. in poetry from the Iowa Writers’ Workshop. In addition to her music degrees, Oni Buchanan holds a B.A. in English from the University of Virginia and an M.F.A. in poetry from the Iowa Writers’ Workshop. Oni’s second poetry manuscript, Spring, has just been selected by Mark Doty as a winner of the 2007 National Poetry Series Open Competition, and will be published by the University of Illinois Press in August 2008. Her first book of poems, What Animal, won the University of Georgia Press Contemporary Poetry Series competition (chosen by Fanny Howe), and was published in October 2003. Oni’s poems are featured in several anthologies including The Best American Poetry 2004 and Legitimate Dangers: American Poets of the New Century, and have been published in numerous journals across the country, including Conduit, Seneca Review, and Gulf Coast.

    "bio": "Kola Heyward-Rotimi is a Faculty Assistant at the University of Maryland's African-American History, Culture, and Digital Humanities initiative (AADHum). He's originally from Durham, NC and he spent four years of his adolescence in Ile-Ife, Nigeria—his father’s birthplace and one of the cultural touchstones that he incorporates into his scholarship and genre-blending creative writing.\nIn the digital humanities, Kola is focused on exploring the dynamics of emerging technologies in relation to marginalized communities within the US and abroad. His undergraduate thesis specifically looked at how these communities used virtual spaces and technology in ways that subverted their mainstream, intended use. These moments of disruption are his primary interest and Kola continues to expand on this work through his position at AADHum.\nHis fiction is also inspired by these cultural and technological intersections—the new ways that the material world changes how people engage with each other. Though these narratives tend to manifest through prose, Kola has also developed mixed media projects implementing video, glitch art, and prose fiction. Kola’s speculative short stories can be found in Clarkesworld and FIYAH, and he was a writer-in-residence at Beijing's Red Gate Gallery in 2019.\nKola has degrees in Computer Science and English from Amherst College, and he is currently represented by Matt Belford at the Tobias Literary Agency. You can find him on Twitter at @KolaHR or at [kolaheywardrotimi.com](http://kolaheywardrotimi.com).\n",

From 1997 until 2017, Pitt served as the Associate Director of the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities (IATH). During his time in IATH, Pitti participated in the design and implementation of many of the faculty fellows' projects, as well as being the principal architect of two international archival description standards, Encoded Archival Description (EAD), and Encoded Archival Context-Corporate Bodies, Persons, and Families (EAC-CPF). Based on EAC-CPF, Pitti launched SNAC in 2010 as an R&D project. In 2015 SNAC became a cooperative program, currently with 29 member repositories. SNAC has received funding from NEH (2010-2012), IMLS (2011-2013), and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation (2012-2019). As chair of ICA EGAD, Pitti is leading the development of the Records in Contexts (RiC) standard that aspires to be the foundation of next-generation archival description and access. Prior to coming to UVa in 1997, Pitti served as the Librarian for Advanced Technology Projects at the University of California, Berkeley. \n",

Previously he was a professor at the College of William and Mary, Georgia Institute of Technology, and Wayne State University. He served as department chair from 1996-99 at Georgia Tech and from 2001-2008 at Wayne State. Grusin received his Ph.D. from the University of California at Berkeley in 1983. He has published numerous chapters and articles and written four books.  He is best known for his foundational work in new media studies. With Jay David Bolter he is the author of Remediation: Understanding New Media (MIT, 1999), which sketches out a genealogy of new media, beginning with the contradictory visual logics underlying contemporary digital media. His most recent book, _Premediation: Affect and Mediality After 9/11_ (Palgrave, 2010), argues that in an era of heightened securitization, socially networked US and global media work to pre-mediate collective affects of anticipation and connectivity, while also perpetuating low levels of apprehension or fear.\n",

Through the use of code, and the creation of custom computer software, he creates simulations of seemingly complex systems to create video and video installations that seek to draw parallels between the ways in which these systems work and the ways in which we, both individually and collectively, navigate the world around us.\nProf. Morse has been teaching at Maryland since 2000. He received his BFA from the University of Wisconsin Stevens Point and his MFA in Art & Technology from The Ohio State University. He has exhbited his work in digital video and sound installation nationally and internationally. Exhibitions include the Corcoran Museum of Art in Washington, DC, the Nanjing Museum in China, the American University Museum at the Katzen Arts Center, Kusthalle Detroit, as well as many gallery exhibitions across the United States, Europe and Asia.\n",

This includes working directly with UMD Libraries on special projects, as well as with other UMD departments and outside institutions on developing new projects and partnerships.\nStephanie’s research revolves around the intersections between digital humanities, libraries, and audiovisual archives: how archival audiovisual media objects function as primary historical documents, and what kind of digital resources and user interfaces facilitate the means for exploring that media in the context of its original production and reception. As MITH’s former Project Manager, she is also interested in the stewardship of digital humanities projects and research data, including streamlining project management, documentation, and sustainability processes.\nShe has a bachelor’s degree in Film Studies and English from the University of Kansas, and a master’s degree in Moving Image Archive Studies from UCLA.\nIn the past, Stephanie was the Project Manager for the [American Archive of Public Broadcasting](http://americanarchive.org/about-the-american-archive) at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, where she managed strategic operational planning for metadata and digitization initiatives. Before moving to DC in 2010, she was the Project Director on a Getty-funded grant for Los Angeles Filmforum entitled _[Alternative Projections: Experimental Film in LA 1945 -1980](http://www.alternativeprojections.com/)_, a historical survey and preservation project resulting in over 35 new oral histories, an academic symposium, a media-rich website and database and a 16+screening exhibition series. The project was part of the Getty’s _Pacific Standard Time_ initiative showcasing postwar art in Los Angeles. She also served as Managing Director of [iotaCenter](http://www.iotacenter.org/), a small nonprofit film archive of experimental film and abstract animation. Before graduate school, Stephanie worked for six years as a researcher and producer on documentaries and television shows, and specialized in finding and licensing archival footage and photos for use in productions.\n",

Dr. Wiesner was granted two CLIR (Council for Library and Information Resources) postdoctoral fellowships to the University of Virginia and the University of North Carolina–Greensboro where she managed digital projects in the libraries and lectured in dance history and research methods. Her ongoing project, ARTeFACT, has been presented at several academic conferences (both Dance and Digital Humanities), been awarded an NEH Digital Start-up Grant, and has been featured in book chapters and journal articles. Dr. Wiesner was awarded an ACLS Digital Innovation Fellowship for 2011 to pursue research into movements representative of conceptual metaphor. She has conducted research into metadata and the development of ontologies for the performing arts using Digital Humanities methodologies and has developed a database of dance publications. A choreographer and dancer, Dr. Wiesner has presented her work in both the US and the UK, written as a dance critic, taught technique and theory at several universities, and continues to work with intersections of language and movement in an attempt to develop automated tagging of movement in dance film. Her current research focuses on movement and notation systems as a means of machine learning and transfer of data between artistic forms.\nIn her spare time, she works with adult dancers with special needs as she remains dedicated to the belief that all people can dance. Wiesner earned her Certification in Movement Analysis (CMA) from the Laban/Bartenieff Institute of Movement Studies and is the LIMS Archivist/Historian. At MITH, Wiesner is Principal Faculty Specialist for the Performing Arts where she works with the DocNow project and manages other projects which relate to the performing arts.\n",

She received her bachelor’s degree from The University of Bucharest, Romania, a Master’s degree in communication from The National School of Political Studies, Bucharest, and another Master’s degree in English from Emporia State University, Kansas. During her graduate studies she became fascinated with the power of computerized typography and explored the relationship between digital studies and rhetoric. Funded by a MITH dissertation fellowship in Spring 2010 she conducted archival research on video poetry at La Casa Totiana, Rome, and at The University of Pisa. She is currently working on her dissertation project, a comparative analysis which engages works produced by Loss Pequeno Glazier (a United States digital poet of Tejano origins) and Caterina Davinio, an Italian computer pioneer. This comparative study extends work on performance developed by theater and poetry theorists and uses its findings to investigate whether the performance of digital poetry opens up space for new and potentially more inclusive conceptions of identity.\n",

Her book about women Romantic poets, titled Women, Epic, and Transition in British Romanticism, was published by the University of Delaware Press in 2011, and she has published articles investigating the poetry of Robert Southey, Mary Russell Mitford, and Lord Byron in context with 18th- and 19th-century views of revolution, world empires, natural sciences, and theater productions. She is currently exploring the applications of TEI XML and other markup languages in Digital Humanities research. She is the architect of the [Digital Mitford Project](digitalmitford.org) and works on other collaborative digital archives and research projects using computational methods to study complicated textual questions, such as [Amadis in Translation](amadis.newtfire.org) and the [Bicentennial Frankenstein Project](https://ebeshero.github.io/Pittsburgh_Frankenstein/). An active member of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), she was elected to serve on from 2016 to 2017 on the TEI Technical Council, an eleven-member international committee that supervises amendments to the TEI Guidelines. A faculty member at Pitt-Greensburg since 2004, she serves as the Director of Pitt-Greensburg's Center for the Digital Text, which supports digital project development and research collaborations among faculty and students. \n",

His work includes editing never-before-heard collections of readings by poets like Gertrude Stein, Robert Frost, and James Weldon Johnson, and his writing has appeared in _The Chicago Review, Oral Tradition,_ and will appear in _Digital Humanities Quarterly._ He has been awarded a creative grant from Harvard University's Woodberry Poetry Room, a James Weldon Johnson Foundation Legacy award, and Penn's Sweeten Prize for best essay in American literature. In addition to his media archaeological work, Mustazza works on experimental poetry audio analyses, designing applications to aid in the research and pedagogy of the performed poem. These include a series of applications for a reading-listening method he terms Machine-Aided Close Listening, which is intended to allow for reading across the text and performance(s) of a poem. \n",

His research is formed around the interplay between social and technical phenomena. Khazraee's doctoral research focused on knowledge production processes in data-intensive, collaborative and multidisciplinary communities of practice, specifically the knowledge production processes in archaeological communities of practice. His research also focuses on how archaeologists construct their epistemic narratives from recorded pieces of information, looking at the way they collaborate and the performativity of information technologies. In another research trajectory, Khazraee looks at the cultural differences in new media use and the relationship between social change and digital technologies. Relying on sociotechnical approaches to social media studies and conceptual frameworks developed in Science Technology Studies (STS), he explores the role of social media in social transformations. Khazraee has also held a Post-Doctoral research fellow position at the [Center for Global Communication Studies](www.global.asc.upenn.edu/) at the [Annenberg School for Communication](https://www.asc.upenn.edu/) at the [University of Pennsylvania](www.upenn.edu/) (2014-2015). He received his Ph.D. in Information Studies from the [College of Computing and Informatics](cci.drexel.edu/), [Drexel University](www.drexel.edu/), and a Master's Degree in Architecture from the University of Tehran. In addition to practicing as an architect in Iran, he has worked in the preservation of historical monuments and sites before joining the Encyclopaedia of Iranian Architectural History (EIAH) in 2006, where he was the director of the ICT Department (2006-2009), with the goal of creating infrastructure for meaningful integration of information technology into cultural heritage practices. \n",

    "bio": "Dr. Lorena Gauthereau is the CLIR-Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Houston's Recovering the US Hispanic Literary Heritage (Recovery) where she works on data curation and is helping to create the first digital humanities center focused on US Latinx studies. There, she leads and collaborates on digital humanities projects and programming. This includes: launching a digital archive for selected recovered collections, creating metadata for postcustodial Latinx collections, organizing a digital humanities reading group with workshops, and creating the \"Are We Good Neighbors?\" project, which maps incidents of discrimination against Mexican Americans in Texas during the 1940s, using affidavits from the Alonso S. Perales Collection. Previously, she worked as the Americas Studies Researcher at Rice University's Humanities Research Center on the Our Americas Archive Partnership, a digital project funded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services. Gauthereau is the 2015 recipient of the Western Literature Association's Louis Owens Award and her dissertation was awarded the Chair's Prize for Best Dissertation in the English Department. Gauthereau received her PhD from Rice University in English literature. Her research interests include Chicana/o literature, Chicana feminism, affect theory, class analysis, decolonial theory, and the digital humanities. Her current book project on working-class Mexican-American literature interrogates race and class in their intersection with affect, taking into account the greater history of colonialism in the Americas. \n",

She is a core faculty member of the Consortium for Critical Diversity in a Digital Age Research (CEDAR).\nDr. Leon received her bachelor of arts in American Studies from Georgetown University in 1997 and her doctorate in American Studies from the University of Minnesota in 2004. Her first book, _[An Image of God: the Catholic Struggle with Eugenics](http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/I/bo15417664.html)_, was published by the University of Chicago Press.\nPrior to joining the History Department at MSU, Dr. Leon spent over thirteen years at George Mason University’s History Department at the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media as Director of Public Projects, where she oversaw dozens of award-winning collaborations with library, museum, and archive partners from around the country.\nDr. Leon’s program of research focuses on two areas. First, she is an historian of American religion with a concentration on U.S. Catholicism. Second, she specializes in digital methods with a focus on public history. As a result, Dr. Leon often is pursuing many research tracks at once. Currently, with the support of an NEH digital publication fellowship, she is at work on a digital project to surface and analyze the community networks and experiences of the cohort of people enslaved and sold by the Maryland Province Jesuits in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries. Simultaneously, she is building a major methodological project on doing community-engaged digital public history.\nDr. Leon directs the Omeka web-publishing platform project, which provides a number of open-source options for digital scholarly communication and public engagement work: Omeka S, for linked data work and Omeka.net for a hosted solution.\nDr. Leon’s ongoing writing, projects, and teaching materials can be found at [6floors.org](http://6floors.org/).\n",

Jina's work involves language translation, sourcing and mining content from material and digital archives, and experimental strategies for humanizing data-visualization. Her work with the archive is also informed by her work with Wikipedia--considering its organizational structure, collective content creation, and how metadata contributes to informational hierarchies (what's visible, what's accessible).
