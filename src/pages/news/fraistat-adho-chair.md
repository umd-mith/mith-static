We’re delighted to announce that MITH Director Neil Fraistat has recently been elected to a two-year term as Chair of the Steering Committee of ADHO, the international [Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations](http://digitalhumanities.org/).

ADHO is an umbrella organization whose goals are to promote and support digital research and teaching across arts and humanities disciplines, drawing together humanists engaged in digital and computer-assisted research, teaching, creation, dissemination, and beyond, in all areas reflected by its diverse membership. ADHO supports initiatives for publication, presentation, collaboration, and training; recognizes and supports excellence in these endeavors; and acts as a community- based consultative and advisory force. In doing so, ADHO embraces and coordinates activity across five constituent organizations and around the world, with activities such as its annual conference, a network of inter-related DH training initiatives, a number of sponsored gatherings, as well as coordinated infrastructure, publishing, and research enterprises.

Members in ADHO societies are those at the forefront of areas such as textual analysis, electronic publication, document encoding, textual studies and theory, new media studies and multimedia, digital libraries, applied augmented reality, interactive gaming, and beyond. They are researchers and lecturers in humanities computing and in academic departments such as English, History, French, Modern Languages, Philosophy, Theatre, Music, Computer Science, and Visual Arts. They are resource specialists working in libraries, archival centers, and with humanities computing groups. They are academic administrators, and members of the private and public sectors. They are independent scholars, students, graduate students, and research assistants. They are from countries in every hemisphere. Membership in ADHO organizations is currently by subscription to the journal [LLC: The Journal of Digital Scholarship in the Humanities](http://llc.oxfordjournals.org/).
