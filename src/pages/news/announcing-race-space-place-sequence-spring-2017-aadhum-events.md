title: Announcing the 'Race, Space, and Place' sequence of Spring 2017 AADHum Events!
---

The [African American History, Culture and Digital Humanities](http://mith.umd.edu/research/aadhum/) (AADHum) Initiative has just announced the its first sequence, [**Race, Space, and Place**](http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/AADhum-Spring-2017-Events.pdf), which explores themes of African American labor, migration, and artistic expression, through a series of complementary Reading Groups (RG), Digital Humanities Incubator (DHI) and Digital Dialogues. A collaboration between MITH and the College of Arts and Humanities (ARHU), AADHum is on campus to help students, faculty, and community members learn and develop ideas, methods, and projects at the intersection of African American History and Culture and the Digital Humanities.

Students, faculty, and community members interested in attending any events should [register here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdiEIszDEFSgS7t2HI8F5qE9uKFniSu0TsIc4wqG3hLK3fZig/viewform?c=0&w=1). Here is a brief reminder of the types of events that may be of interest:

**Digital Humanities Incubators: **Four sessions meant to facilitate research and pedagogical DH projects focused on issues of Space and Place. Through workshops, small tutorials, group and individual consultations, participants receive training and coaching to explore new approaches to digital research, gain familiarity with mapping tools, and collaborate with scholars across campus. They can participate in individual sessions or the entire sequence.

**Reading Groups:** Six reading group sessions push scholars to think more critically about their own work and the field of black digital studies more broadly. The goal of the Reading Groups is to create an intellectually stimulating space to share ideas and bring together traditional humanities and social scientific work in African American studies with exciting new work in digital cultures.

And **Digital Dialogues: **MITH is partnering with AADHum to bring two phenomenal Digital Studies scholars to campus. [André Brock](http://mith.umd.edu/dialogues/dd-spring-2017-andre-brock/) and [Kishonna Gray](http://mith.umd.edu/dialogues/dd-spring-2017-kishonna-gray/) will both join us for an additional day beyond their talk to enrich our dialogue at the reading group session that follows. Please [let us know](mailto:kwins@umd.edu) if you wish to attend a lunch or a separate meeting with either of these speakers.

You can find more information, including a description of individual sessions, on the AADHum [website](http://arhusynergy.umd.edu/programs/aadhum/events/dh_incubators) and on the below poster.

### **We look forward to seeing you this semester!**
