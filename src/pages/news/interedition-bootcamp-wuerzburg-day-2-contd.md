After several hours of hacking away, we've decided to head out for food and drinks. I have to say it is an experience to stay in a fancy hotel lounge and see the looks of hotel guests as they pass by the table of DH hackers and their laptops. There was much progress made by both sides of the table at the bootcamp. Nick Laiacona has implemented an HTML canvas to mimic typing text on the screen and is still working away at it. So far on the Annotation side, we're 60% complete with developing the back end RESTful service for registering and querying OAC-spec annotations. Two of the Annotation members from the University of Madrid started implementing the front end wrapper using the GWT library, while I'm using MITHGrid to do the same. Whatever the outcome, I think this experimental work can benefit a lot of the OAC annotation work we're doing back at MITH.

Tomorrow we're planning an outing to the Residenz, a local palace, wine cellar, and botanical garden. Many more pictures to follow!
