title: Join MITH! We're Hiring a Lead Developer
---

MITH is looking to hire a creative, team-oriented person to be our new **Lead Developer**. The successful candidate will work collaboratively with other members of the MITH staff on research-intensive projects in the digital humanities.

The Lead Developer will design, write, test, document, and deploy code. The Lead Developer will also establish development milestones, help provide technical management and oversight, and identify emergent technologies and best practices. We envision the person in this position as someone with a strong commitment to research and development who is focused on and excited about building high-quality software that demonstrates new possibilities for humanities research applications.

This position will report to the Associate Director and duties will be split into roughly four categories: Software Development (60%); Management of Development Processes (20%); Systems Architecture (10%); and Engagement with Open Source Software Projects (10%).

MITH both relies on and believes in the value of open source software. We hope that the Lead Developer will participate in supporting third-party projects and libraries that MITH uses. Engagement with open source technology is intentionally construed broadly to include all of the activities that might go into supporting projects. Contributions might be but are not limited to writing code or documentation, doing outreach, organizing groups or events, and conducting code review. Time spent on open source development is part of paid time and the Lead Developer will have full discretion to participate in open source communities to the extent they uphold the same standards of professionalism, respect, and safety expected in other University work environments.

As part of the University of Maryland, MITH is committed to "inclusive excellence"—the notion that in order to educate our students with excellence, in order to foster outstanding research and scholarship, and in order to be national and global leaders, we must be diverse and inclusive. Minorities and women are encouraged to apply for this position.

The University of Maryland, College Park, actively subscribes to a policy of equal employment opportunity, and will not discriminate against any employee or applicant because of race, age, sex, color, sexual orientation, physical or mental disability, religion, ancestry or national origin, marital status, genetic information, political affiliation, and gender identity or expression.

We're very excited to welcome the successful candidate as part of MITH. This position will be open until filled and we plan to review applications on a rolling basis. If this position describes you, please consider submitting an application as soon as possible.
