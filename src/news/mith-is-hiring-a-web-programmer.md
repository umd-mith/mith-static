Faculty Research Assistant (Web Programmer)

The Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) at the University of Maryland in College Park seeks a web programmer to work on two grant funded projects. The first involves the creation of a collaboratively-edited database of 3-dimensional models of historical theater buildings. The second will integrate MITH's web-based multimedia annotation tool (AXE) into the Center for History and New Media's world-renowned citation management system, Zotero. Both are potentially very high profile projects in the digital humanities and it is likely this one year appointment will lead to other exciting opportunities in the digital humanities.
