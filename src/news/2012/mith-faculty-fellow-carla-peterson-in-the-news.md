![Carla Peterson](../../images/2012-01-carla-peterson-200x200.jpg)In celebration of Black History Month, this week the University of Maryland is profiling Carla Peterson, professor of English and MITH Faculty Fellow, on her research project, [Black Gotham Archive](../part-2-mith-faculty-fellow-answers-readers-questions-on-times-taking-questions/). In ["Online Archive to Share Stories of 19th Century Free Blacks,"](http://www.umd.edu/Black_History_Month/peterson.cfm) Karen Shih, University Editor, interviews Peterson on her family history, 19th century black New Yorkers, and the origins of her digital archive.

[Black Gotham Archive](http://www.blackgothamarchive.org/) is an extension of Dr. Peterson's book, [Black Gotham: A Family History of African Americans in Nineteenth-Century New York City](http://yalepress.yale.edu/book.asp?isbn=9780300162554) (Yale University Press, 2011). Dr. Peterson has received much well-deserved recognition for her research so far. Just last week, she was featured on The New York Times City Room Blog ["Taking Questions" series](http://mith.umd.edu/part-2-mith-faculty-fellow-answers-readers-questions-on-times-taking-questions/), where she answered readers' questions on 19th century black New York. Tomorrow, February 23rd, Dr. Peterson will be speaking at [The Clayman Institute for Gender Research at Stanford University](http://gender.stanford.edu/events/recovering-lives-black-women-19th-century-carla-peterson), and Saturday the 25th she will be giving a talk in Washington, DC for the Association for the Study of African American Life and History.
