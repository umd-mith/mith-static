This Colloquium is designed specifically for graduate students interested in the intersections of race, gender, ethnicity and other dimensions of difference. Our intention is to extend current thinking about theoretical, methodological, and pedagogical approaches to intersectional analysis, as well as apply these insights to graduate students' own work.

Please join us for the first colloquium of the semester, "Technology and Intersectionality," featuring Dr. Carl Stahmer from the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities; Asim Ali, doctoral student in the Department of American Studies; Michele Mason (doctoral candidate in Communication); and more speakers to be announced. We will be exploring ways in which technology can aid intersectional research and teaching.

All are welcome to attend. A light lunch will be served.

February 16, 1200-200, Marie Mount; Maryland Room.
