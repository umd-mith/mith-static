Call for Participation: Advanced TEI Seminar as MITH

An advanced seminar in TEI encoding for manuscripts will be offered at MITH January 20-22, 2010. The seminar is sponsored by the Brown University Women Writers Project with generous funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities. It will be led by Julia Flanders and Syd Bauman, the instructors for a very successful introductory seminar on TEI held at MITH in 2008.

This seminar assumes a basic familiarity with TEI and will be focused on the detailed challenges of encoding manuscript materials, including editorial, transcriptional, and interpretive issues and the methods of representing these in TEI markup.

Intended for people who are already involved in a text encoding project or are in the process of planning one, the seminar will be focused on the detailed challenges of encoding manuscript materials, including editorial, transcriptional, and interpretive issues and the methods of representing these in TEI markup. It will include a mix of presentations, discussion, case studies using participants' projects, hands-on practice, and individual consultation. It will also be strongly project-based: participants will present their projects to the group, discuss specific challenges and encoding strategies, develop encoding specifications and documentation, and create encoded sample documents and templates.

Project teams and collaborative groups are encouraged to apply, although individuals are also welcome. A basic knowledge of the TEI Guidelines and some prior experience with text encoding (e.g. an introductory workshop, job experience, etc.) will be assumed.

Travel funding is available of up to \$500 per participant.

The application deadline is August 10.
