Two exciting news items from the [Preserving Virtual Worlds](http://web.archive.org/web/20150709192456/http://pvw.illinois.edu:80/pvw/) project, where MITH has been a partner alongside of the University of Illinois, Stanford University, and the Rochester Institute of Technology, as well as Linden Lab, creators of Second Life.

The project has released its [final report](https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/handle/2142/17097), 195 pages detailing two years worth of findings from our research, including such topics as emulation, virtualization, migration, archival description, collections policy, hardware stemmatics, Rosetta computing, and disk image forensics.

PVW has also been shortlisted as one of five finalists for the prestigious [2010 Digital Preservation Award](https://web.archive.org/web/20151224073816/http://www.dpconline.org/newsroom/latest-news/638-2010-digital-preservation-award-shortlists-press-release), sponsored by the Digital Preservation Coalition and the Institute for Conservation. The winner will be announced in December.
