It is with great sadness that MITH notes the passing of Roy Rosenzweig, founding director of the Center for History and New Media at George Mason University ([chnm.gmu.edu](http://chnm.gmu.edu/)), as well as professor of history at GMU.

Roy's achievements and accomplishments were many. In 2003, he was the second of only five recipients of the prestigious Lyman award, conferred by the National Humanities Center for outstanding achievement in the field of digital humanities. All agree that he was

one of our earliest and most significant pioneers.

Roy was a collaborator and tremendous supporter of MITH, and we will miss his presence across town terribly.

The Washington Post obituary is here:

Testimonials and remembrances have already started to appear around the Web.
