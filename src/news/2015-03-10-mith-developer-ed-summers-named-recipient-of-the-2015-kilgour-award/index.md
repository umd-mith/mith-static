MITH is delighted to announce that our Lead Developer, [Ed Summers](http://mith.umd.edu/people/person/ed-summers/), was recently named the 2015 recipient of the Kilgour Award. The Kilgour is jointly awarded by the [The Library & Information Technology Association](http://www.ala.org/lita/) (LITA), a division of the American Library Association (ALA), and the [OCLC](http://www.oclc.org/research.html), for “research relevant to the development of information technologies, especially work which shows promise of having a positive and substantive impact on any aspect(s) of the publication, storage, retrieval and dissemination of information, or the processes by which information and data is manipulated and managed.” The award will be presented to Ed at the ALA Annual Conference in San Francisco in June 2015, and also includes a cash prize and citation.

Please join us in congratulating Ed on his success! You can read the entire press release on the ALA website [here](http://www.ala.org/news/press-releases/2015/03/ed-summers-recipient-2015-kilgour-award).
