Despite the recent icy weather and the relative quiet of campus during winter term, MITH continues to remain a center of activity in the world of digital humanities. On Monday January 17, MITH welcomed an advanced seminar on TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) funded by the NEH and conducted by the Brown University Women Writers Project which wraps up today.

Tomorrow, January 20, MITH will host a two day workshop led by Associate Director, Doug Reside and Research Associate, Tanya Clement on professionalization in digital humanities centers called, “[Off the Tracks—Laying New Lines for Digital Humanities Scholars](http://mith.umd.edu/research/off-the-tracks/)”. This workshop will address the rapidly emerging phenomenon of alternative academic careers among the hybrid scholar-programmers now staffing many DH centers.
