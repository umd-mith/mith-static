On Wednesday, September 5th, MITH [invited](http://mith.umd.edu/research/dedication) friends and colleagues present and past to help us celebrate our move to a new, sunlit space. Director of the [Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media](http://chnm.gmu.edu/) (CHNM) Dan Cohen gave the keynote, highlighting MITH's international work and membership in the "DH culture of nice". University of Maryland Vice President for Research Pat O'Shea, College of Arts and Humanities Dean Bonnie Thornton Dill, and Dean of Libraries Pat Steele also spoke.

Due to the excitement and quantity of our guests, the first speaker is sometimes difficult to see, but stick with us: the view improves as the video continues. Thanks to everyone who joined us [in person](https://secure.flickr.com/photos/18303158@N00/7944898270/in/pool-mith) and [in spirit](https://twitter.com/fraistat/status/243401261209251841)!
