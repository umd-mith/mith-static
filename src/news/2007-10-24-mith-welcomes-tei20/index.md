MITH is very pleased to welcome the [Text Encoding Initiative Consortium](http://www.tei-c.org) to College Park next week for its [20th Anniversary Members' Meeting](http://www.lib.umd.edu/dcr/events/teiconference/index.html). Registration is now closed, but the program is jam-packed with talks, poster sessions, meetings, and social occasions.

We are very pleased to [co-sponsor](http://www.lib.umd.edu/dcr/events/teiconference/sponsors.html) this important and exciting event for the field.
