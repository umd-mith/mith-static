Work led by MITH on a Mellon-funded symposium and CLIR report on [_Digital Forensics and Born-Digital Content in Cultural Heritage Collections_](http://www.clir.org/pubs/abstract/pub149abst.html) has been recognized by the Library of Congress in its year-end roundup of [Top Ten Digital Preservation Developments in 2010](http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/news/2010/20101229news_article_top10stories.html)! (Also mentioned is our work on the Preserving Virtual Worlds project, which was a short-listed finalist for the prestigious Digital Preservation Coalition Award.)
