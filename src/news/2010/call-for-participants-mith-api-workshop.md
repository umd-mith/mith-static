The Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities will host a two-day workshop on developing APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for the digital humanities. [mith.umd.edu/apiworkshop](http://mith.umd.edu/apiworkshop/) The workshop will gather 40-50 digital humanities scholars and developers, who along with industry leaders will demonstrate their APIs during this “working weekend.” We will discuss ways that existing and future APIs could be leveraged for digital humanities projects.

The workshop format will consist of morning presentations and afternoon unconferencing. We’ll also schedule time for lightning talks. Some participants may seek to explore hands-on hacking of APIs following presentations; others may want to discuss ways that they could use an existing API. The workshop will include participants of varying skill levels and technical knowledge, and engage both developers and project managers. Once the participant list is finalized, we plan to kick-off a discussion online before the workshop so that we’re ready to make the best use of our afternoon unconference time.

We invite those interested in participating to apply for the workshop by January 14th. [mith.umd.edu/apiworkshop/apply/](http://mith.umd.edu/apiworkshop/) Participants will be notified shortly after the deadline. Due to limited space, we can accommodate 40-50 participants.

Questions can be directed to MITH Assistant Director, Dave Lester: dlester@umd.edu.
