![T'Sey-Haye Preaster](../../images/2018-12-2994B8EDDDD6410A9D59248326979D6A-980x735.jpg) We are excited to welcome [T'Sey-Haye Preaster](https://mith.umd.edu/people/person/tsey-haye-preaster/) to the MITH team as the Project Coordinator for the second phase of the [Documenting the Now](http://docnow.io) project, generously funded by The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. T'Sey-Haye has already been on the job since late October contributing ideas and helping the DocNow team get started on the next phase of our work.

Prior to joining MITH, T'Sey-Haye was key in making sure that the "Intentionally Digital, Intentionally Black" conference hosted by the [AADHum initiative](http://aadhum.umd.edu) in October of this year came off so successfully. At that time, she was a member of the Marketing and Communications Office in the [College of Arts and Humanities](https://www.arhu.umd.edu/).

Check out [her biography](https://mith.umd.edu/people/person/tsey-haye-preaster/), follow her on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RISunshine), and look for her byline here talking about the exciting things happening on the Documenting the Now project.

Welcome T'Sey-Haye!
