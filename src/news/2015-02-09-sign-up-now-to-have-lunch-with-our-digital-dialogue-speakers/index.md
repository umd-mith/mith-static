With our [Digital Dialogue speaker series](http://mith.umd.edu/digital-dialogues/schedule/), MITH aims to foster community by extending an open offer to interested graduate students, staff, and faculty to request one of a limited number of spots to join our speakers for lunch. This is a great opportunity to engage directly with the speakers and discuss their work in a less formal setting. Our Spring 2015 season starts up with [Shannon Mattern on February 24](http://mith.umd.edu/dialogues/dd_spring-2015-shannon-mattern/ "Shannon Mattern: Strata of Sentience: Deep Mapping the Media City"), and space is limited, so please [fill out this form](http://ter.ps/spring2015dd) as soon as possible with your information and speaker preferences.

Requests will be accepted on a rolling basis, but are first come, first served. Any questions can be sent to Stephanie Sapienza at [sapienza@umd.edu](mailto:sapienza@umd.edu).
