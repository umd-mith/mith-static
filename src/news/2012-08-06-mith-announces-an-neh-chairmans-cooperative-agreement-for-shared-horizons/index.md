The [Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities ](http://www.mith.umd.edu)(MITH) is pleased to announce that it has been selected as a recipient of a National Endowment for the Humanities Chairman’s Cooperative Agreement for “Shared Horizons: Data, Biomedicine, and the Digital Humanities,” an interdisciplinary symposium exploring the intersection of digital humanities and biomedicine.

Working in cooperation with the[ Office of Digital Humanities ](http://www.neh.gov/odh/)of the [National Endowment for the Humanities ](http://www.neh.gov)(ODH); the US [National Library of Medicine](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/) (NLM) of the [National Institutes for Health](http://www.nih.gov), Department of Health and Human Services; and the [Research Councils UK](http://www.rcuk.ac.uk) (RCUK), Shared Horizons will be a unique forum through which participants and their institutions will be able to address questions about collaboration, research methodologies, and the interpretation of evidence arising from the interdisciplinary opportunities in this burgeoning area of biomedical-driven humanities scholarship.

Shared Horizons will create opportunities for disciplinary cross-fertilization through a mix of formal and informal presentations combined with breakout sessions, all designed to promote a rich exchange of ideas about how large-scale quantitative methods can lead to new understandings of human culture. Bringing together researchers from the digital humanities and bioinformatics communities, the symposium will explore ways in which these two communities might fruitfully collaborate on projects that bridge the humanities and medicine around the topics of sequence alignment and network analysis, two modes of analysis that intersect with “big data.” The workshop will be held April 10-12, 2012 in Washington, D.C. and College Park, MD.
