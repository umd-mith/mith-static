MITH is pleased to announce an award from the [National Endowment for the Humanities](http://www.neh.gov "National Endowment for the Humanities") 2012 [Institutes for Advanced Topics in the Digital Humanities](http://www.neh.gov/grants/odh/institutes-advanced-topics-in-the-digital-humanities "Institutes for Advanced Topics in Digital Humanities") competition for a series of workshops on data curation for humanities scholars, librarians, and archivists interested in sustaining meaningful access to humanities research materials.

The _Digital Humanities Data Curation Institutes_ project, directed by Trevor Muñoz, Associate Director of MITH and Assistant Dean for Digital Humanities Research, University Libraries, will facilitate a multi-institutional collaboration between MITH and the [University Libraries](http://www.lib.umd.edu/ "University Libraries at UMD") at the University of Maryland, the [Women Writers Project (WWP)](http://www.wwp.brown.edu/ "Women Writers Project") at Brown University, and the [Center for Informatics Research in Science and Scholarship (CIRSS)](http://cirss.lis.illinois.edu/ "CIRSS") at the [Graduate School of Library and Information Science (GSLIS)](http://www.lis.illinois.edu/ "GSLIS"), at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign to provide three workshops during 2013.

The practice of cutting-edge humanities research increasingly involves acquisition, synthesis, and management of data in digital form. The theoretical knowledge and practical skills of information science, librarianship, and archival science represent a vital component of the skill set that will be required to succeed in the rapidly transforming landscape of the academy and the wider society.

Digital Humanities Data Curation institutes will serve as opportunities for participants with all levels of expertise—from beginners to the most advanced—to receive guidance in understanding the role of data curation in enriching humanities research projects. By the conclusion of each institute, participants will be adept at formulating solutions for existing challenges and will be able to document their data curation strategies in the form of data curation plans and strategic risk assessments, key elements of innovative digital scholarship.

A core resource for the Institute will be the Digital Humanities Curation Guide (DH Curation: [guide.dhcuration.org](http://guide.dhcuration.org "DH Curation")) developed at GSLIS. The Guide allows instructors and participants to share scholarly knowledge about literature, tools, projects, and standards relevant to curating humanities data. A forum through which knowledge developed at the institute can be shared with the broader research community, the Guide will allow for the aggregation of resources and responses from across the Institute’s three events. Julia Flanders (WWP) and Dorothea Salo (Faculty Associate in the School of Library and Information Studies at the University of Wisconsin at Madison) will serve as co-instructors alongside Muñoz for the three institute events and will contribute resources to the Guide.

Applications to join this cohort of scholars focused on discipline-specific curation practices and skills will be announced in late fall 2012 with the Institute beginning in Spring 2013.
