There have been some adjustments to the fall Digital Dialogues schedule. There will be no talk on 11/6. LINDA FRUEH's talk, originally scheduled for 11/6, will move to 11/27. JONATHAN AUERBACH's talk, originally scheduled for 11/27, will be rescheduled next semester. Digital Dialogues will resume on 11/13 with STEPHAN GREENE and PHILIP RESNIK, "The Linguistics of Spin."
