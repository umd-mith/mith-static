As part of the national Humanities Advocacy Day events on Capitol Hill that took place on Wednesday, March 1, MITH was one of ten NEH funded projects chosen to participate in a reception and exhibition honoring the NEH's 40th Anniversary. MITH Acting Director Neil Fraistat and Acting Associate Director Carl Stahmer were on hand with a poster and slide show about MITH (both beautifully designed by MITH Web and Information Designer Greg Lord), and were kept busy fielding questions from many interested parties.

The reception was packed with over 150 people, all of whom heard talks by Rep. David Price and Rep. Jim Leach, both strong Congressional advocates for the Humanities, and by NEH Chairman Bruce Cole.
