We are now seeking applications for MITH’s Winnemore Dissertation Fellowship. Applicants should be advanced graduate students whose dissertation includes innovative research agendas involving any substantive intersection between new media or new technology and the humanities.

The Winnemore Fellowship for Spring 2012 will be awarded in the amount of \$12,092, and will provide the scholar with a stipend and funds towards health insurance and tuition remission up to five credits. In addition, the Fellow will receive the consultation services of MITH staff.

We welcome applications from eligible graduate students from any part of the University. Graduate students must be enrolled in a terminal degree program (M.A., M.F.A, M.S., Ph.D. etc). Fellows are expected to be in-residence throughout the duration of their fellowship, attend MITH events, participate in development opportunities, and be engaged with the digital humanities more broadly. By the end of the fellowship, we expect fellows to have made significant progress towards the completion of their dissertation.

Interested applicants should submit a cover letter, CV, short abstract, project proposal and two letters of recommendation to Jennifer Guiliano, Assistant Director of MITH, by Monday, December 5th. Please visit the [~~job announcement~~](http://mith.umd.edu/community/fellowships/winnemore-fellows/) to read further details. Announcements of Fellows will be made by December 16, 2011.
