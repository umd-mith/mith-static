Last week, Carla Peterson, professor of English and a MITH Faculty Fellow, was featured by [The New York Times City Room "Taking Questions" series](http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/13/taking-questions-carla-l-peterson/) on her book, _Black Gotham: A Family History of African Americans in Nineteenth-Century New York City_ (Yale University Press, 2011). Over the course of the week, readers submitted their questions to Dr. Peterson about nineteenth-century black New York. She has taken the time to respond to questions. One of her responses appears here. Visit the ["Taking Questions"](http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/15/answers-about-black-history-in-19th-century-new-york-part-1/) page to read more.

Q. _The article mentions black doctors and pharmacists in New York in the 1800s. Where did they receive their educations? Were there any schools open to them or did they simply work in hospitals and watch what others were doing?_—Ed Schwab, Alexandria, VA

A. In the 1790s the New York Manumission Society established several schools for black children. Its members maintained that education was a necessary component of freedom (despite the fact that several of them were themselves slave owners). These schools were known as African Free Schools, the most famous of which was African Free School No. 2 located on Mulberry Street. This was the school that my great-great-grandfather attended along with several boys who later became prominent leaders of the city's black community and also worked nationally with men like Frederick Douglass. Until the 1830s, when the city took over their management, these schools offered as good an education as that of other charity schools of the time, probably even better.

Throughout this period, however, New York's black leaders refused to stay on the sidelines when it came to educating their young. Since poor school attendance was a real problem (how can you send your kids to school in the winter when they have no shoes or overcoats?), black leaders visited homes to see how they could help out. They also established an educational society that set up its own schools, but few of them lasted due to lack of funds.

Getting a higher education was equally difficult. James McCune Smith was denied entrance to U.S. medical schools, so he went to the University of Glasgow medical school (graduating first in his class!). My great-grandfather Philip Augustus White attended the College of Pharmacy of the City of New York, graduating in 1844, even though professional certification in pharmacy was not required at the time. In the 1850s, Peter Williams Ray gained admission to an American medical school, Castleton medical college in Vermont. But when he tried to become a member of the Kings County Medical Society, he was rejected, the argument being that "by science that this was a white man's Society. … Therefore a colored man could not be admitted." Yet these black men surmounted the odds and went on to establish successful pharmacy and medical practices.
