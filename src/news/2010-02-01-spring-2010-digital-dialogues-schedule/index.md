We are very pleased to announce another semester of Digital Dialogues. In the four year since we have made Digital Dialogues a weekly event at MITH we have hosted over 100 speakers from the College Park campus and beyond (often far beyond) to discuss their work and current issues in digital humanities and new media.

This semester we lead off with a presentation from MITH's newest full time member of staff, **Dave Lester** who comes to us from George Mason's Center for History and New Media as an Assistant Director. Dave is (literally) famous all over the world for the THATCamp phenomenon--something he will introduce to the MITH community on February 9th, when he addresses "Collaborative Approaches to Digital Humanities: Unconferences and Crowdsourcing." Please join us at 12:30 in the MITH conference room.
