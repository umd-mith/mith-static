For those who might have missed it during the vacation, The New York Times [ran a long article](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/26/books/a-literary-history-of-word-processing.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=matthew%20kirschenbaum&st=cse) about Matt Kirschenbaum’s research for his upcoming book, [“Track Changes: A Literary History of Word Processing,”](https://mkirschenbaum.wordpress.com/2011/04/10/track-changes/) set to be published by Harvard University Press in 2013. Congratulations Matt!
