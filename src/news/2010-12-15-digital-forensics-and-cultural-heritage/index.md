MITH is pleased to announce the availability of _Digital Forensics and Born-Digital Content in Cultural Heritage Collections_, a new CLIR report emerging from a Mellon-sponsored workshop held last spring at the University of Maryland and led by MITH's own Matt Kirschenbaum.

The report was written by Matthew G. Kirschenbaum, Richard Ovenden, and Gabriela Redwine, with research assistance from Rachel Donahue. It introduces the field of digital forensics in the cultural heritage sector and explores some points of convergence between the interests of those charged with collecting and maintaining born-digital cultural heritage materials and those charged with collecting and maintaining legal evidence.
