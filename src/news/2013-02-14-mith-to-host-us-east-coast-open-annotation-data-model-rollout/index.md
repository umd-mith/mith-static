MITH is pleased to announce that it will be hosting the U.S. East Coast Open Annotation Data Model Rollout on Monday, May 6th. This meeting is free, but registration is required due to space limitations. Lunch will be provided. Visit [the rollout page](http://www.openannotation.org/RolloutInfo.html) for more information, including [an agenda](http://www.openannotation.org/MITH_Agenda.html) and [registration](https://www.eventville.com/Catalog/EventRegistration1.asp?Eventid=1010271). Please register by April 19th.

The Open Annotation Data Model Rollouts are a series of three meetings organized by the members of the Open Annotation Consortium and Annotation Ontology to introduce the Open Annotation Data Model Community Specification developed through their collaboration as the [W3C Open Annotation Community Group](http://www.w3.org/community/openannotation/). This series of meetings is made possible by generous funding from the [Andrew W. Mellon Foundation](http://www.mellon.org/).

These day-long public rollouts will inform digital humanities and sciences computing developers, curators of digital collections, and scholars using digital content about the W3C Open Annotation Community Group’s work. Topics will include the Open Annotation Data Model, the W3C Open Annotation Community Group, existing implementations of Open Annotation producers and consumers, and developer tools and resources.

MITH will be presenting its [video annotation developer toolkit](http://umd-mith.github.com/OACVideoAnnotator/) developed in conjunction with [Alexander Street Press](http://alexanderstreet.com/). The toolkit provides a JavaScript framework for creating and viewing annotations of video embedded in a web page without having access to the video stream, enabling annotation of proprietary video. MITH will also outline its ongoing work developing a Drupal module that will use this toolkit to enable annotation of video embedded in a website.

The May event is the second in the series. Other rollouts are being held at Stanford University in April and at the University of Manchester in June.
