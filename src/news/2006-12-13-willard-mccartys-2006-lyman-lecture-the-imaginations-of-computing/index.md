**Willard McCarty** (King's College, London), 2006 winner of the prestigious Richard W. Lyman award for achievements in digital humanities, recently delivered his Lyman lecture at the National Humanities Center. A Webcast of the event, entitled "[The Imaginations of Computing](https://web.archive.org/web/20070505005353/http://www.nhc.rtp.nc.us:80/newsrel2006/prmccartywebcast.htm)," is now available. McCarty is one of the leading theorists in the field, and the lecture is a superb introduction to his current positions.
