The call for papers for [Digital Humanities 2009](http://web.archive.org/web/20110907061828/http://www.mith2.umd.edu:80/dh09/) is [now available](http://web.archive.org/web/20110116212058/http://www.mith2.umd.edu/dh09/?page_id=54). (In case you've been living in a digital humanities cave for the last twelve months, this prestigious international conference is being hosted by MITH.)
