Given the strong response to our [interest survey](https://mith.umd.edu/assessing-interest-in-a-dh-ds-student-organization/), MITH will be hosting an informational/organizational meeting to support the creation of a digital humanities/digital studies student group here at UMD.

WHEN: Tuesday, September 18, 2018 WHEN: 3:00 PM WHERE: [MITH, 0301 Hornbake Library North](https://mith.umd.edu/about/maps-directions/)

We'll provide a little information about t[he process of starting an official student organization](http://thestamp.umd.edu/student_org_resource_center_sorc/registration/registration_requirements) and the support that MITH will provide to the DH/DS student group. However, most of the time will be reserved for interested students to talk to each other about what they would like to see happen. All are welcome—just bring questions, ideas, and enthusiasm!

Notes will be shared with those who cannot attend at this date/time.

We look forward to seeing everyone!
