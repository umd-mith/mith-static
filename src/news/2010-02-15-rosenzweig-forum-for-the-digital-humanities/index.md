"Negotiating the Cultural Turn(s): Subjectivity, Sustainability, and Authority in the Digital Humanities" — a conversation with Tim Powell and Bethany Nowviskie

Wednesday, February 17, 2010 from 4:30 to 6:30pm Murray Room, Lauinger Library, Georgetown University

Tim Powell directs digital archive projects for the Ojibwe Indian bands of northern Minnesota, the American Philosophical Society, and the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. Tim will speak about a project entitled Gibagadinamaagoom (Ojibwe: "To Bring to Life, to Sanction, to Give Authority") and how the focus on Ojibwe culture affects issues of intellectual property, open access, and the design of the interface, metadata, and database.

Bethany Nowviskie directs the University of Virginia Library's efforts in digital research and scholarship, and is also associate director of the Mellon-funded Scholarly Communication Institute. She will discuss a number of projects from UVA's SpecLab, Scholars' Lab, and NINES research groups related to the expression of subjectivity and perspective in interpretive digital environments.

Together (and as digital humanities scholars practicing outside of the typical tenure-track path), Tim and Bethany will address and open a conversation about issues of cultural authority, intellectual property, innovation vs. sustainability, objectivity, and the need to think outside the academy's walls.

Sponsored and hosted by the Center for New Designs in Learning & Scholarship (CNDLS).

The Rosenzweig Forum for the Digital Humanities is named in honor of Roy Rosenzweig and is a collaboration of the Center for History & New Media (CHNM) at George Mason University, the Center for New Designs in Learning & Scholarship (CNDLS) at Georgetown University, and the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) at the University of Maryland.
