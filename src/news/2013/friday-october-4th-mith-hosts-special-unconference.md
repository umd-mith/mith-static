Congress may shut down, but Digital Humanities can’t be stopped! Join the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) this Friday, October 4th at 10:00 am to present the project you would have presented at the NEH project directors meeting. We’ll be hosting an \*unconference\* and open house to allow project directors and the public to learn about your funded project and to discuss potential collaborations among attendees.
