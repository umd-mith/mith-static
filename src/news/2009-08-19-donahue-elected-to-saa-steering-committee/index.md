At this year's annual meeting of the [Society of American Archivists](http://www.archivists.org/) (SAA), MITH GA Rachel Donahue was elected to the [Electronic Records Section](http://www.archivists.org/saagroups/ers/ershist.asp) (ERS) steering committee. Established in 1994, ERS "functions as a locus of expertise, leadership, and information sharing for SAA regarding management and preservation of records in electronic form."

The ERS Steering committee composed of six members. Each member serves a term of three years, and one new member is elected by a majority of section members present at the annual meeting.

Steering committee members assist the chair and vice chair in leading and organizing section activities including endorsing session proposals for the annual meeting, advocating for and consulting with SAA on issues related to electronic records, and creating task forces and other projects as necessary.
