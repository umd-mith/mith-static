The nora project has new content online. Of greatest interest perhaps is the ability to experiment with a demo based on our work here at Maryland; there's also significant new material under Screenshots, and new content in Publications/Reports. (All of these are available under the Work In Progress section.)

Nora is a multi-institutional, multi-disciplinary Mellon-funded project to apply text mining and visualization techniques to large humanities-oriented digital library collections (starting with a 10,000-text corpus of 18th and 19th century British and American literature). MITH, in collaboration with [HCIL](http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil), is one of several institutional partners in the grant. Matthew Kirschenbaum, MITH's Acting Associate Director, serves at the Maryland PI. Martha Nell Smith, MITH's founding Director, is co-PI.

Matthew Kirschenbaum also recently participated on behalf of nora in The Valve''s recent book event for Franco Moretti's [_Graphs, Maps, Trees_](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/archive_asc/C48). His contribution is entitled [Poetry, Patterns, and Provocation](http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/article/poetry_patterns_and_provocation_the_nora_project/).
