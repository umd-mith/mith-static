Most of his collections can be seen online at the site [textfiles.com](textfiles.com), which began as a small archive of 1980s computer bulletin board history and has expanded to over fifty years of documents and artifacts. Besides presenting at computer conferences and other events, Jason has also shot two documentaries, _BBS The Documentary_ and _Get Lamp_, the second of which covers the text adventure game genre, a precursor to the modern games industry. An outspoken critic of poor data archiving and destruction of digital history, Jason co-founded Archive Team, an activist group of rogue archivists dedicated to saving digital history and gaining attention to the importance of the artifacts online communities. Improbably, he also works for the most popular cat on Twitter, @sockington, who has nearly a million and a half followers. \n",

His EDUCE project (Enhanced Digital Unwrapping for Conservation and Exploration) seeks to create readable images of texts such as papyrus scrolls, without opening them, using minimally invasive scanning and virtual unwrapping. Dr. Seales is developing and evaluating new techniques for digital acquisition, restoration, and visualization using real-world library collections with particular focus on preservation and dissemination. He is also the director of the STITCH project (Surgical Technology Integration with Tools for Cognitive Human Factors), which envisions a networked operating room of the future, where computers and surgical instruments are connected. The result: an enriched and more efficient environment for surgeons. \n",

She teaches and researches in the field of the digital humanities, focusing especially on applying digital methods mindfully within the context of visual and material culture studies. For the Department of Art History and Architecture, Alison serves as the Director of the Visual Media Workshop (VMW). The mission of the VMW is to develop and encourage the creation of innovative methods for producing, disseminating, and preserving the academic work using digital technologies as a fundamental component of our scholarly toolkit. To achieve these objectives, she directs a technologically-focused environment of collaboration and creativity where students and faculty from a number of departments across the University come together to work on projects that apply digital methods and techniques with focus and intention. For the School of Computing and Information (SCI), Alison researches the relationship between the historical practice of information management and digital computing, both as a historical narrative and also as a complex, changing process in contemporary America. This research, plus all of the theories, concepts, and models that she teaches at SCI, are put into daily practice in her work directing the VMW. In terms of teaching, Alison teaches courses in digital preservation and the digital humanities, especially, but not exclusively, at the graduate level.Alison is also the principal contact for the [DHRX: Digital Humanities Research at Pitt](www.dhrx.pitt.edu/) initiative, which represents a transdisciplinary network of scholars here at the University of Pittsburgh who use digital methods to study the ways in which humans interact with their environments, whether social or cultural, natural or human-created. \n",

He studied mathematics and philosophy at the University of Oxford, and started his career as a programmer before working for many years as a lecturer in software engineering at the University of Westminster. He then turned to the history of computing, gaining a PhD in science and technology studies from University College London. His previous book, A Science of Operations: Machines, Logic, and the Invention of Programming (Springer, 2011), explores the influence of logical ideas on the evolution of programming methods. Following on from ENIAC in Action (MIT 2016), he is working on recapturing the details of early programming ideas and practices in other contexts.

By using a wide range of computational tools and techniques, ranging from text encoding to text mining and visualization, Clement's project is a bracing demonstration of just how completely our readings and understandings of complex literary work can be reconfigured with the intervention of new media. \n",

But for someone who spends the majority of his time analyzing ancient and medieval artifacts, he also embraces social media and stresses its value even for the oldest, most established academic and cultural institutions. Noel believes passionately that institutions should free their digital data.\nSince 1999 Noel has spearheaded the conservation of a manuscript known as the [Archimedes Palimpsest](http://archimedespalimpsest.org/). The palimpsest is a unique Byzantine prayer book made up of parchments which contain hidden writings from three original previously-unknown texts: treatises written by Archimedes; works by the 4th-century B.C. Attic Orator Hyperides; and 3rd-century commentary on Aristotle’s _Categories_, by an unknown author. Using a powerful particle accelerator Noel and his team were able to uncover the hidden texts and publish all their images and findings on the Internet, available to anyone for free under a Creative Commons license.\nNoel currently lives in Baltimore, Maryland, where he curates at the Walters, working to ensure that the public has free digital access to his collection.\n",

    "bio": "Alexandrina is a game designer, community-based researcher, and media artist who believes in the possibilities of the decolonial imaginary using digital media as an emancipatory tool. She is an Assistant Professor of Interactive Media and Game Development at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. Her most recent game, _The Resisters_, was an alternate reality game she designed through participatory research with young people of color about local social movement history in Providence, RI. Before joining WPI, she earned her Ph.D. from the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism at the University of Southern California and an M.A. from the [College of Ethnic Studies](ethnicstudies.sfsu.edu/) at San Francisco State University---the only autonomous institution of its kind in the United States---where she researched adolescent girls of color and their race and gender identity development through online doll play. Alexandrina blends her knowledge of the digital with an aesthetic sense of tactile design; some of her past work includes designing a collection of dresses made entirely from recycled goods as a benefit for a cancer wellness nonprofit. Alexandrina utilizes principles of self-determination and relevant education in her teaching and research. She teaches at university and high school levels, and specializes in digital media skill building with young people of color. She is a co-chair of Situated Critical Race + Media (SCR+M!) of [FemTechNet](femtechnet.org), a multi-university collaborative feminist technology organization. She is the Futurist for the Latinx Pacific Archive and is working on developing a line of ovulation-tracking jewelry that is both affordable and flawlessly stylish. As a community-based researcher and participatory designer, her speculative work is still anchored in lived experience. She works closely with [New Urban Arts](newurbanarts.org), a youth art studio and imagination incubator. Alexandrina uses critical pedagogy and community-based research as platforms to work with institutions, community organizations, researchers, and artists. Her research has received funding from the National Science Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation-John E. Sawyer Seminars, the Teagle Foundation, the Rhode Island Council of the Humanities, and the Voqal Fund. \n",

Having received a B.A. in French History and Literature and Afro-American Studies from Harvard University and a Ph.D. in French and Romance Philology from Columbia University, Professor Glover joined the Barnard College faculty in 2002. Her teaching and research interests include francophone literature, particularly that of Haiti and the French Antilles; colonialism and postcolonialism; and sub-Saharan francophone African cinema. She advises students in French, Africana Studies, Comparative Literature, and Human Rights. Her book, _Haiti Unbound: A Spiralist Challenge to the Postcolonial Canon_ (Liverpool UP 2010), addresses the general issue of canon formation in the francophone Caribbean and the particular fate of the Haitian Spiralist authors vis-à-vis this canon. She has published articles in _Public Culture_, _The French Review_, _French Forum_, _Small Axe_, _Research in African Literatures_, _The Journal of Postcolonial Writings_, and _The Journal of Haitian Studies_, among others. She is the co-editor of \"New Narratives of Haiti,\" a special issue of _Transition_ magazine; co-editor of \"Translating the Caribbean,\" a volume of critical essays on translation in the Americas published as a two-part special section of _Small Axe_; first editor of _Revisiting Marie Vieux Chauvet: Paradoxes of the Postcolonial Feminine_, a volume of critical essays published as a special issue of _Yale French Studies_; and co-editor of the forthcoming Duke University Press _Haiti Reader_. She has translated Frankétienne's _Mûr à crever_ (Ready to Burst), René Depestre's _Hadriana dans tous mes rêves_ (Hadriana in All My Dreams), and Chauvet's _Danse sur le volcan_ (Dance on the Volcano). She has been on the editorial board of the _Romanic Review_ since 2002, on the editorial board of _Small Axe_ since 2012, and since 2016 is the founding co-Editor of [sx archipelagos : a small axe platform for digital practice](smallaxe.net/sxarchipelagos/) and co-Director of the digital humanities project _In the Same Boats: Toward an Afro-Atlantic Intellectual Cartography_. She is currently completing a monograph concerning individualism, self-regard, and representations of womanhood in Caribbean prose fiction. Professor Glover has been the recipient of fellowships and awards from the Fulbright Foundation, the Mellon Foundation, The New York Public Library, the PEN/Heim Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the National Endowment for the Humanities, and she is a regular contributor to _The New York Times Book Review_. She has recently completed a monograph titled \"Disorderly Women: On Caribbean Community and the Ethics of Self-Regard.\" \n",

She is interested in exploring the affordances and application of digital humanities tools and methods in historical (music) research, the application of standards, including TEI and MEI, for open access research and publishing, and the use of minimal computing. She also explores and writes about topics in nineteenth century music with a focus on gender, women, and performance criticism and reception. Anna recently published a book entitled \"The Life and Music of Teresa Carreño (1853-1917): A Guide to Research\", and developed a [digital project](https://documentingcarreno.org), which documents Carreño's performance career with primary source materials, metadata, and transcriptions, as well as explores her performances and texts through data analysis and visualization tools. She writes about using digital humanities tools and methods to explore, visualize, and augment scholarship. Anna is currently serving on the Executive Council for the Association for Computers and the Humanities (ACH), is Chair of the Affiliation and Liaisons Committee (ACH), and Chair of the Organizing Committee for the upcoming Music Encoding Conference (2020). \n",

Donald supports the [Games for Learning Institute](g4li.org), a consortium of 8 universities, 14 principal investigators, and a small army of graduate students whose mission is to explore what makes games fun, what makes them educational, and how to best blend the two goals. He is the Microsoft champion for the [Just Press Play](play.rit.edu/) project, an experiment to transform the undergraduate education of 750 students at Rochester Institute of Technology into a gameful narrative. Other projects include [Project Garibaldi](blogs.msdn.com/b/surface/archive/2010/04/27/experience-the-garibaldi-panorama-on-surface.aspx) and [Game Show NYC](www.gameshownyc.com/). Before joining MSR, Donald Brinkman served for two years as a technical program manager for the Microsoft education group. In that role he was responsible for defining vision of innovative business intelligence and analytics for education as well as driving a variety of enterprise-scale server capabilities. Prior to joining Microsoft he spent eight years in developmental and technical roles acquiring and executing government research contracts in areas such as quantum computation; signals intelligence; electromagnetic and kinetic simulations; behavioral economics; game theory; and cross-cultural communications. Donald is a writer, painter, game designer, and a passionate advocate of the benefits of building bridges between technical and humanist disciplines. He is particularly interested in disruptive technologies that leverage crowdsourcing, social computing, culture jamming, transmedia, and other non-traditional approaches.

Ms. Buchanan’s concerts have been described as “mesmerizing,” “insightful,” “exciting,” “inspiring,” and full of “flair, abandon, and color,” and her audiences have felt “transported,” “connected,” and “awed.” She has performed solo recitals throughout the U.S. and abroad, at such venues as the Instituto Brasileiro de Administracao Municipal (IBAM) in Rio de Janeiro, BRAZIL, the University of Guelph as well as Conrad Grebel University College in Ontario, CANADA, the Dame Myra Hess Memorial Concerts in Chicago, the Baltimore Museum of Art, and the Harvard University Hall Concert Series, among many others. Ms. Buchanan has been a guest soloist on many occasions, including performances for the Harvard Arts First festivals, the Harvard Music Department’s Composer Colloquium series, the Cicada Festival Emerging Artists Recital (Mount Gretna, PA), and as the guest concerto soloist with the Waynesboro Orchestra (Waynesboro, VA), conducted by Eric Stassen. In addition, Ms. Buchanan has given ensemble performances in New England Conservatory’s Jordan Hall, Harvard University, and at the New School of Music in Cambridge, MA.\nMs. Buchanan received her Master’s degree in piano performance from the New England Conservatory of Music, her Bachelor’s degree in music from the University of Virginia, and conducted three years of her music studies at the University of Iowa School of Music while pursuing an M.F.A. in poetry from the Iowa Writers’ Workshop. In addition to her music degrees, Oni Buchanan holds a B.A. in English from the University of Virginia and an M.F.A. in poetry from the Iowa Writers’ Workshop. Oni’s second poetry manuscript, Spring, has just been selected by Mark Doty as a winner of the 2007 National Poetry Series Open Competition, and will be published by the University of Illinois Press in August 2008. Her first book of poems, What Animal, won the University of Georgia Press Contemporary Poetry Series competition (chosen by Fanny Howe), and was published in October 2003. Oni’s poems are featured in several anthologies including The Best American Poetry 2004 and Legitimate Dangers: American Poets of the New Century, and have been published in numerous journals across the country, including Conduit, Seneca Review, and Gulf Coast. A Flash version of Oni Buchanan’s kinetic poem “The Mandrake Vehicles” is on permanent display at the Conduit website, and she is currently at work on two other motion- and technology-driven poem projects.\n",

These moments of disruption are his primary interest and Kola continues to expand on this work through his position at AADHum.\nHis fiction is also inspired by these cultural and technological intersections—the new ways that the material world changes how people engage with each other. Though these narratives tend to manifest through prose, Kola has also developed mixed media projects implementing video, glitch art, and prose fiction. Kola’s speculative short stories can be found in Clarkesworld and FIYAH, and he was a writer-in-residence at Beijing's Red Gate Gallery in 2019.\nKola has degrees in Computer Science and English from Amherst College, and he is currently represented by Matt Belford at the Tobias Literary Agency.

From 1997 until 2017, Pitt served as the Associate Director of the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities (IATH). During his time in IATH, Pitti participated in the design and implementation of many of the faculty fellows' projects, as well as being the principal architect of two international archival description standards, Encoded Archival Description (EAD), and Encoded Archival Context-Corporate Bodies, Persons, and Families (EAC-CPF). Based on EAC-CPF, Pitti launched SNAC in 2010 as an R&D project. In 2015 SNAC became a cooperative program, currently with 29 member repositories. SNAC has received funding from NEH (2010-2012), IMLS (2011-2013), and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation (2012-2019). As chair of ICA EGAD, Pitti is leading the development of the Records in Contexts (RiC) standard that aspires to be the foundation of next-generation archival description and access. Prior to coming to UVa in 1997, Pitti served as the Librarian for Advanced Technology Projects at the University of California, Berkeley. \n",

Previously he was a professor at the College of William and Mary, Georgia Institute of Technology, and Wayne State University. He served as department chair from 1996-99 at Georgia Tech and from 2001-2008 at Wayne State. Grusin received his Ph.D. from the University of California at Berkeley in 1983. He has published numerous chapters and articles and written four books.  He is best known for his foundational work in new media studies. With Jay David Bolter he is the author of Remediation: Understanding New Media (MIT, 1999), which sketches out a genealogy of new media, beginning with the contradictory visual logics underlying contemporary digital media. His most recent book, _Premediation: Affect and Mediality After 9/11_ (Palgrave, 2010), argues that in an era of heightened securitization, socially networked US and global media work to pre-mediate collective affects of anticipation and connectivity, while also perpetuating low levels of apprehension or fear.\n",

Interested in digital humanities since graduate school, Purdom has worked at Michigan State University’s [Matrix](http://www2.matrix.msu.edu/), [Virginia Tech Libraries](http://www.lib.vt.edu/), and the [Scholars’ Lab ](http://scholarslab.org/)at the University of Virginia Library.\nPurdom is broadly interested in the implicit and explicit effort that digital humanities can do for social, cultural, and environmental justice. Applying principles from Feminist Interface Design, Purdom and her Scholars’ Lab colleague [Jeremy Boggs](http://scholarslab.org/people/jeremy-boggs/), explore how the process of feature development and public documentation shape the experience of users and render the theoretical underpinnings of digital work more accessible. Recent publications include [Praxis](https://digitalpedagogy.commons.mla.org/keywords/praxis/), a keyword in the MLA Commons Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities: Concepts, Models, and Experiments written with [Bethany Nowviskie](http://nowviskie.org/) and Jeremy Boggs as well as a chapter in [Making Humanities Matter](https://github.com/jentery/mhm), edited by Jentery Sayers.\n",

He received his PhD from Columbia University. Hayim's research has been at the intersection of classical Jewish texts (especially legal texts) and social and cultural history. His most recent book is on the development of the rabbinic movement in Palestine in the third and fourth centuries of the Common Era (AD) seen from the perspective of Roman provincial history. His current project, drawing on the same body of literature, is a digital scholarly edition of a principal legal text known as the Mishnah. \n",

Through the use of code, and the creation of custom computer software, he creates simulations of seemingly complex systems to create video and video installations that seek to draw parallels between the ways in which these systems work and the ways in which we, both individually and collectively, navigate the world around us.\nProf. Morse has been teaching at Maryland since 2000. He received his BFA from the University of Wisconsin Stevens Point and his MFA in Art & Technology from The Ohio State University. He has exhbited his work in digital video and sound installation nationally and internationally. Exhibitions include the Corcoran Museum of Art in Washington, DC, the Nanjing Museum in China, the American University Museum at the Katzen Arts Center, Kusthalle Detroit, as well as many gallery exhibitions across the United States, Europe and Asia.\n",

Brown serves as the Assistant Director of the African American History, Culture and Digital Humanities (AADHum) Initiative where she co-directs the Restorative Justice Project and leads research, teaching, and programmatic initiatives. She was the recipient of the 2017-2019 Mellon-ACLS public fellowship, working as program manager at the Humanities Action Lab at Rutgers University-Newark. There she launched the multi-media installation Climates of Inequality: Stories of Environmental Justice. As Curator of African American History and Culture at the Michigan State University Museum she worked with the Desmond & Leah Tutu Legacy Foundation in Cape Town, SA to co-curate the traveling exhibition _Ubuntutu: Life Legacies of Love and Action_, and co-author the companion catalog. She has written and given talks on her two digital projects [#BlkTwitterstorians](https://twitter.com/#BlkTwitterstorians) and [#MuseumsRespondtoFerguson](https://twitter.com/#MuseumsRespondtoFerguson). The desire to surface how Black folks have imagined and crafted liberation animates her exploration in un/merging material culture and virtual environments.\nHer current manuscript in progress reckons with the historic mishandling of Black women’s textile art and illuminates the sophisticated ways that makers have visualized Black political thought.\nBrown holds a Ph.D. in Public History from Middle Tennessee State University, an M.A. in Public History from Northern Kentucky University, and a B.S. in History from the Honors College at Coppin State University.\n",

This includes working directly with UMD Libraries on special projects, as well as with other UMD departments and outside institutions on developing new projects and partnerships.\nStephanie’s research revolves around the intersections between digital humanities, libraries, and audiovisual archives: how archival audiovisual media objects function as primary historical documents, and what kind of digital resources and user interfaces facilitate the means for exploring that media in the context of its original production and reception. As MITH’s former Project Manager, she is also interested in the stewardship of digital humanities projects and research data, including streamlining project management, documentation, and sustainability processes.\nShe has a bachelor’s degree in Film Studies and English from the University of Kansas, and a master’s degree in Moving Image Archive Studies from UCLA.\nIn the past, Stephanie was the Project Manager for the [American Archive of Public Broadcasting](http://americanarchive.org/about-the-american-archive) at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, where she managed strategic operational planning for metadata and digitization initiatives. Before moving to DC in 2010, she was the Project Director on a Getty-funded grant for Los Angeles Filmforum entitled _[Alternative Projections: Experimental Film in LA 1945 -1980](http://www.alternativeprojections.com/)_, a historical survey and preservation project resulting in over 35 new oral histories, an academic symposium, a media-rich website and database and a 16+screening exhibition series. The project was part of the Getty’s _Pacific Standard Time_ initiative showcasing postwar art in Los Angeles. She also served as Managing Director of [iotaCenter](http://www.iotacenter.org/), a small nonprofit film archive of experimental film and abstract animation. Before graduate school, Stephanie worked for six years as a researcher and producer on documentaries and television shows, and specialized in finding and licensing archival footage and photos for use in productions.\n",

This includes working directly with UMD Libraries on special projects, as well as with other UMD departments and outside institutions on developing new projects and partnerships.\nStephanie’s research revolves around the intersections between digital humanities, libraries, and audiovisual archives: how archival audiovisual media objects function as primary historical documents, and what kind of digital resources and user interfaces facilitate the means for exploring that media in the context of its original production and reception. As MITH’s former Project Manager, she is also interested in the stewardship of digital humanities projects and research data, including streamlining project management, documentation, and sustainability processes.\nShe has a bachelor’s degree in Film Studies and English from the University of Kansas, and a master’s degree in Moving Image Archive Studies from UCLA.\nIn the past, Stephanie was the Project Manager for the [American Archive of Public Broadcasting](http://americanarchive.org/about-the-american-archive) at the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, where she managed strategic operational planning for metadata and digitization initiatives. Before moving to DC in 2010, she was the Project Director on a Getty-funded grant for Los Angeles Filmforum entitled _[Alternative Projections: Experimental Film in LA 1945 -1980](http://www.alternativeprojections.com/)_, a historical survey and preservation project resulting in over 35 new oral histories, an academic symposium, a media-rich website and database and a 16+screening exhibition series. The project was part of the Getty’s _Pacific Standard Time_ initiative showcasing postwar art in Los Angeles. She also served as Managing Director of [iotaCenter](http://www.iotacenter.org/), a small nonprofit film archive of experimental film and abstract animation. Before graduate school, Stephanie worked for six years as a researcher and producer on documentaries and television shows, and specialized in finding and licensing archival footage and photos for use in productions.\n",

Brennan** is the Associate Director of the Public Projects division at the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media (CHNM) and Research Assistant Professor in the Department of History and Art History at George Mason University. At RRCHNM, Brennan manages many current and legacy digital projects. Currently, she is the end user coordinator for the Omeka digital publishing platform and is co-leading the development of Hidden Histories of America's Front Lawn, a mobile site uncovering the history of the National Mall. Prior to coming to RRCHNM in 2005, she worked as the Director of Education and Public Programs at the U.S. Navy Museum in Washington, DC for seven years. She has co-authored essays on teaching the history of technology, doing oral history in the digital age, and on the challenges of online collection projects. Additionally, two of her essays appear in edited collections published by the Smithsonian Institution Press. She has made several presentations on digital history, digital tools, online collecting and archiving, and postal history. She earned her Ph.D. in U.S. history at Mason and her dissertation, Stamping American Memory: Stamp Collecting in the U.S. 1880s-1930s was awarded the 2010 Moroney Prize for Scholarship in Postal History. In 2012, she was awarded the University of Michigan Press-HASTAC Prize for Digital Humanities to create a new web project, Stamping American Memory. Her research interests include how museums use the web and digital platforms, material culture and memory, and popular collecting practices. When not working, she enjoys cooking, eating, and talking about food, and playing outside. \n",

Dr. Wiesner was granted two CLIR (Council for Library and Information Resources) postdoctoral fellowships to the University of Virginia and the University of North Carolina–Greensboro where she managed digital projects in the libraries and lectured in dance history and research methods. Her ongoing project, ARTeFACT, has been presented at several academic conferences (both Dance and Digital Humanities), been awarded an NEH Digital Start-up Grant, and has been featured in book chapters and journal articles. Dr. Wiesner was awarded an ACLS Digital Innovation Fellowship for 2011 to pursue research into movements representative of conceptual metaphor. She has conducted research into metadata and the development of ontologies for the performing arts using Digital Humanities methodologies and has developed a database of dance publications. A choreographer and dancer, Dr. Wiesner has presented her work in both the US and the UK, written as a dance critic, taught technique and theory at several universities, and continues to work with intersections of language and movement in an attempt to develop automated tagging of movement in dance film. Her current research focuses on movement and notation systems as a means of machine learning and transfer of data between artistic forms.\nIn her spare time, she works with adult dancers with special needs as she remains dedicated to the belief that all people can dance. Wiesner earned her Certification in Movement Analysis (CMA) from the Laban/Bartenieff Institute of Movement Studies and is the LIMS Archivist/Historian. At MITH, Wiesner is Principal Faculty Specialist for the Performing Arts where she works with the DocNow project and manages other projects which relate to the performing arts.\n",

She received her bachelor’s degree from The University of Bucharest, Romania, a Master’s degree in communication from The National School of Political Studies, Bucharest, and another Master’s degree in English from Emporia State University, Kansas. During her graduate studies she became fascinated with the power of computerized typography and explored the relationship between digital studies and rhetoric. Funded by a MITH dissertation fellowship in Spring 2010 she conducted archival research on video poetry at La Casa Totiana, Rome, and at The University of Pisa. She is currently working on her dissertation project, a comparative analysis which engages works produced by Loss Pequeno Glazier (a United States digital poet of Tejano origins) and Caterina Davinio, an Italian computer pioneer. This comparative study extends work on performance developed by theater and poetry theorists and uses its findings to investigate whether the performance of digital poetry opens up space for new and potentially more inclusive conceptions of identity.\n",

Heather's independent work invites engagement from diverse publics, invites collaboration with other cultural producers, and requires masterful organizational, interpersonal, and logistical skills. Additionally, she has spearheaded the BLT Wikipedia initiative and is invested in proliferating the people's encyclopedia as a collaborative work requiring the efforts of a diversity of community members, and this perspective has informed our event programming.

His dissertation explores the emergence of the poetry audio archive in the early 20th century, alongside the rise in sound recording technologies. His work includes editing never-before-heard collections of readings by poets like Gertrude Stein, Robert Frost, and James Weldon Johnson, and his writing has appeared in _The Chicago Review, Oral Tradition,_ and will appear in _Digital Humanities Quarterly._ He has been awarded a creative grant from Harvard University's Woodberry Poetry Room, a James Weldon Johnson Foundation Legacy award, and Penn's Sweeten Prize for best essay in American literature. In addition to his media archaeological work, Mustazza works on experimental poetry audio analyses, designing applications to aid in the research and pedagogy of the performed poem. These include a series of applications for a reading-listening method he terms Machine-Aided Close Listening, which is intended to allow for reading across the text and performance(s) of a poem. \n",

His research is formed around the interplay between social and technical phenomena. Khazraee's doctoral research focused on knowledge production processes in data-intensive, collaborative and multidisciplinary communities of practice, specifically the knowledge production processes in archaeological communities of practice. His research also focuses on how archaeologists construct their epistemic narratives from recorded pieces of information, looking at the way they collaborate and the performativity of information technologies. In another research trajectory, Khazraee looks at the cultural differences in new media use and the relationship between social change and digital technologies. Relying on sociotechnical approaches to social media studies and conceptual frameworks developed in Science Technology Studies (STS), he explores the role of social media in social transformations. Khazraee has also held a Post-Doctoral research fellow position at the [Center for Global Communication Studies](www.global.asc.upenn.edu/) at the [Annenberg School for Communication](https://www.asc.upenn.edu/) at the [University of Pennsylvania](www.upenn.edu/) (2014-2015). He received his Ph.D. in Information Studies from the [College of Computing and Informatics](cci.drexel.edu/), [Drexel University](www.drexel.edu/), and a Master's Degree in Architecture from the University of Tehran. In addition to practicing as an architect in Iran, he has worked in the preservation of historical monuments and sites before joining the Encyclopaedia of Iranian Architectural History (EIAH) in 2006, where he was the director of the ICT Department (2006-2009), with the goal of creating infrastructure for meaningful integration of information technology into cultural heritage practices. \n",

She is a core faculty member of the Consortium for Critical Diversity in a Digital Age Research (CEDAR).\nDr. Leon received her bachelor of arts in American Studies from Georgetown University in 1997 and her doctorate in American Studies from the University of Minnesota in 2004. Her first book, _[An Image of God: the Catholic Struggle with Eugenics](http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/I/bo15417664.html)_, was published by the University of Chicago Press.\nPrior to joining the History Department at MSU, Dr. Leon spent over thirteen years at George Mason University’s History Department at the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media as Director of Public Projects, where she oversaw dozens of award-winning collaborations with library, museum, and archive partners from around the country.\nDr. Leon’s program of research focuses on two areas. First, she is an historian of American religion with a concentration on U.S. Catholicism. Second, she specializes in digital methods with a focus on public history. As a result, Dr. Leon often is pursuing many research tracks at once. Currently, with the support of an NEH digital publication fellowship, she is at work on a digital project to surface and analyze the community networks and experiences of the cohort of people enslaved and sold by the Maryland Province Jesuits in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries. Simultaneously, she is building a major methodological project on doing community-engaged digital public history.\nDr. Leon directs the Omeka web-publishing platform project, which provides a number of open-source options for digital scholarly communication and public engagement work: Omeka S, for linked data work and Omeka.net for a hosted solution.\nDr. Leon’s ongoing writing, projects, and teaching materials can be found at [6floors.org](http://6floors.org/).\n",

Her independent practice is informed by the intuitive strategies of folk artists and traditional craft techniques, and interweaves histories latent within found texts, objects, narratives, and spaces. Jina's work involves language translation, sourcing and mining content from material and digital archives, and experimental strategies for humanizing data-visualization. Her work with the archive is also informed by her work with Wikipedia--considering its organizational structure, collective content creation, and how metadata contributes to informational hierarchies (what's visible, what's accessible). Jina received her BFA from Carnegie Mellon University and her MFA from Stanford University. \n",

This year he is in Princeton at the Institute for Advanced Study and is also a Guggenheim Fellow. Since 2003, Stewart has served as executive director of HMML, a global organization within Saint John's University, Collegeville, Minnesota, that is the world's leader in digital manuscript preservation. Stewart has developed HMML's extensive manuscript digitization initiatives in historic Christian and Muslim communities in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, India and Africa. He has earned acceptance and trust from these communities, who know him both as a modern Benedictine monk and as a recognized expert on the history of early Christianity and monasticism. Stewart is also a professor of theology at Saint John's School of Theology and Seminary, teaching the history of monasticism. \n",

It was a national bestseller, and met with wide acclaim from _The New York Times_, _The Wall Street Journal_, _The Boston Globe_, _Salon_, _The Guardian_, _The Economist, The Independent, Kirkus Reviews, Bookforum, Scientific American, New Scientist, Brain Pickings, Ars Technica, Science News_ and many others. Blum discussed _Tubes_ with Terry Gross on NPR’s _Fresh Air_; BBC 4 presented it as a “Book of the Week”; and Blum spoke about his research on the stages of TED Global and the London School of Economics, among dozens of other venues. Design Observer named Tubes its 2012 “Book of the Year,” and London’s Independent called it “The year’s most stimulating and original ‘travel’ book.” When the Edward Snowden/NSA revelations made the Internet’s infrastructure a vital diplomatic question, journalists from Washington to London to Frankfurt to São Paulo relied on _Tubes_ as a crucial reference. It has been translated into nine languages.\n",

As Rice's vice provost and university librarian, he was responsible for the administration, strategy, policymaking and fundraising for the libraries, the Digital Library Initiative, the Electronic Resource Center (now the Digital Media Center) and, most recently, the Rice University Press. During 2000-04, he served also as vice president and chief information officer, taking on responsibility for administration, planning and policy for information technology services and data application centers and working with faculty and students in support of teaching and research. Henry revived the Rice University Press after a decade-long hiatus, taking advantage of technology to make it the first fully digital university press in the U.S. [[Source: Rice University Website](news.rice.edu/2007/01/18/university-librarian-henry-leaving-rice/)] \n",
