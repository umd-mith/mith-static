Professor Sample argues the ideal result is the open source professor, a teacher and scholar who applies the tenets of the open source software community to his or her own professional life. This means sharing, conversation, collaboration, and reflection at every step in the teaching and research process, not just with the final product. Technology plays a key role in making open source professing possible, and Professor Sample will discuss the philosophical and practical implications of such a transparent approach to pedagogy and scholarship, as well as possible pitfalls for untenured faculty.</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Mark Sample Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"The Open Source Professor","talk_subtitle":"Teaching, Research, and Transparency ","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2009-10-27T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2009-10-27T17:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"name":"Mark Sample","affiliations":[{"title":"Assistant Professor of English","department":null,"institution":"George Mason University"}],"person_group":null,"slug":"mark-sample","new_id":493,"headshot":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#a8a898","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/22740414d81cf7e294269bc019714034/93a06/z46UuJ_jSndEs3m6J5I7FrlQp8iU3WnTUwq81jkE7cs.jpg","srcSet":"/static/22740414d81cf7e294269bc019714034/06b6d/z46UuJ_jSndEs3m6J5I7FrlQp8iU3WnTUwq81jkE7cs.jpg 50w,\n/static/22740414d81cf7e294269bc019714034/a76a3/z46UuJ_jSndEs3m6J5I7FrlQp8iU3WnTUwq81jkE7cs.jpg 100w,\n/static/22740414d81cf7e294269bc019714034/93a06/z46UuJ_jSndEs3m6J5I7FrlQp8iU3WnTUwq81jkE7cs.jpg 200w","sizes":"(min-width: 200px) 200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/22740414d81cf7e294269bc019714034/5db40/z46UuJ_jSndEs3m6J5I7FrlQp8iU3WnTUwq81jkE7cs.webp 50w,\n/static/22740414d81cf7e294269bc019714034/876d6/z46UuJ_jSndEs3m6J5I7FrlQp8iU3WnTUwq81jkE7cs.webp 100w,\n/static/22740414d81cf7e294269bc019714034/ddf96/z46UuJ_jSndEs3m6J5I7FrlQp8iU3WnTUwq81jkE7cs.webp 200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 200px) 200px, 100vw"}]},"width":200,"height":250}}},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p><strong>Professor Mark Sample</strong> teaches and researches contemporary American literature and Digital Culture at George Mason University.
