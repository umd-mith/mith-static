During that time, the Museum undertook a learning journey to test assumptions about community engagement, crowdsourcing, and digital development. “Making History with the Masses Revisited” reviews the theory and practice of citizen history as updated for 2016, and outlines a path forward for citizen history as a methodology in public history.\nCitizen history is, as ever, a contract and a dialogue, where the participant is more than a user or contributor and is instead elevated to a full partner in the process of discovery. This time, though, the process of learning from participants begins before they even open the project site. By listening to and learning from communities from the first steps of a citizen history project, institutions can better serve not only the needs of the project or their participants, but the larger body of historical inquiry and their institutions’ larger goals of engagement and relevance. This talk will also touch on the nuts and bolts of creating a citizen history project: who needs to be in the room where it happens? What does success look like? And how do you ensure the waltz of marketing, digital development, historical inquiry, and participant engagement is in time from the first beat to the last chord?</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Elissa Frankle Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Making History w/ the Masses Revisited","talk_subtitle":"History Unfolded & the Realities of Citizen History","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2016-02-09T17:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"name":"Elissa Frankle","affiliations":[{"title":"Digital Projects Coordinator of Digital Learning and New Media","department":null,"institution":"United States Holocaust Memorial Museum"}],"person_group":null,"slug":"elissa-frankle","new_id":425,"headshot":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#383838","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/da45d282d4dbc7b04e24734e702b4f91/c6982/FC2Fkw059nzfEiJJnZUO_dHnI0d1zOIKPfn-8_gCrwY.jpg","srcSet":"/static/da45d282d4dbc7b04e24734e702b4f91/912e6/FC2Fkw059nzfEiJJnZUO_dHnI0d1zOIKPfn-8_gCrwY.jpg 63w,\n/static/da45d282d4dbc7b04e24734e702b4f91/bcc75/FC2Fkw059nzfEiJJnZUO_dHnI0d1zOIKPfn-8_gCrwY.jpg 125w,\n/static/da45d282d4dbc7b04e24734e702b4f91/c6982/FC2Fkw059nzfEiJJnZUO_dHnI0d1zOIKPfn-8_gCrwY.jpg 250w","sizes":"(min-width: 250px) 250px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/da45d282d4dbc7b04e24734e702b4f91/3af89/FC2Fkw059nzfEiJJnZUO_dHnI0d1zOIKPfn-8_gCrwY.webp 63w,\n/static/da45d282d4dbc7b04e24734e702b4f91/4a7bd/FC2Fkw059nzfEiJJnZUO_dHnI0d1zOIKPfn-8_gCrwY.webp 125w,\n/static/da45d282d4dbc7b04e24734e702b4f91/34055/FC2Fkw059nzfEiJJnZUO_dHnI0d1zOIKPfn-8_gCrwY.webp 250w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 250px) 250px, 100vw"}]},"width":250,"height":208}}},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Elissa Frankle is the Digital Projects Coordinator for Digital Learning and New Media at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, where she manages the in-museum digital experience and advocates for the inclusion of visitor voices in the work of the Museum.
