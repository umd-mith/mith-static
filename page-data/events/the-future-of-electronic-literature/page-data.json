Highlights included Katherine Hayle's keynote (nicely summarized at <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20111121183914/http://jilltxt.net/?p=1992\">jilltxt</a>), considering the idea of \"literary\" vs. \"literature\" and providing very intelligent close readings of a variety of works of electronic literature, readings from new works by Stephanie Strickland, Rob Kendall, Nick Montfort, Deena Larsen, and others, as well as three very good panel discussions. The process-intensive panel looked at the idea of process from several different angles ranging from process-intensive collaboration, to natural language interface processing, to story generation. The international panel featured demonstrations of electronic literature from around the world, including works in Spanish, French, Catalan, and Nordic languages, and also highlighted the fact that electronic literature is a global movement -- ELO isn't the only organization concerned with this work, but has shared interests and opportunities for collaboration with organizations including <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20111121183914/http://www.labo-nt2.uqam.ca/\">nt2</a>, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20111121183914/http://elinor.nu/\">Elinor</a>, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20111121183914/http://www.uoc.edu/in3/hermeneia/cat/activitats/activitats.html\">Hermeneia</a>, and others.\nThe Future of Electronic Literature panel was also an engaging discussion of how new technologies might effect electronic literature, and how new ways of organizing material and collaborating might effect the way that we shape the field.</p>"}},"image":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#a8d8b8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/91cb3cfa4f0ea999bde8c26d09fcfbd8/8860e/event_elo-symposium..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/91cb3cfa4f0ea999bde8c26d09fcfbd8/42c27/event_elo-symposium..jpg
