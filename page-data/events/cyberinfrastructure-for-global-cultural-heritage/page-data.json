The challenge today is to design fields that are accessible across barriers of language, culture and immediate intent: we are beginning to design fields for translation, customization and personalization. This talk looks at the interaction between wholly automated and largely general systems and the knowledge structures on which particular domains depend.\nOn the one hand, we need to update our models of intellectual activity to keep pace the already present and rapidly emerging practices. At the same time, as we identify new services to support new activities, we need to develop methods whereby we can mine the machine actionable data from vast libraries of legacy print data available as page images and scalable accept user contributions of every type. One goal in the next five years is to have available for speakers of Arabic and Chinese the core data about Greco-Roman culture and then to make available corresponding materials about Chinese and Arabic culture to the English speaking public. This involves a suite of data driven services that provide high performance results for particular domains.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Gregory Crane Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Cyberinfrastructure for Global Cultural Heritage","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2008-04-29T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2008-04-29T17:45:00.000Z","location":null,"speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Greg Crane","slug":"greg-crane","new_id":434,"group_type":["External"],"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/0ea9c75485147c30761d44e51cd32688/d6c95/Greg-Crane..jpg","srcSet":"/static/0ea9c75485147c30761d44e51cd32688/c9998/Greg-Crane..jpg 100w,\n/static/0ea9c75485147c30761d44e51cd32688/503f5/Greg-Crane..jpg 200w,\n/static/0ea9c75485147c30761d44e51cd32688/d6c95/Greg-Crane..jpg 400w","sizes":"(min-width: 400px) 400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/0ea9c75485147c30761d44e51cd32688/90ebf/Greg-Crane..webp 100w,\n/static/0ea9c75485147c30761d44e51cd32688/59b5d/Greg-Crane..webp 200w,\n/static/0ea9c75485147c30761d44e51cd32688/697e6/Greg-Crane..webp 400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 400px) 400px, 100vw"}]},"width":400,"height":250}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p><strong>Greg Crane</strong> is currently a Professor of Classics, as well as Editor-in-Chief of the Perseus Project at Tufts University.

His current research focuses on \"computational humanities\" and how this new field can help to democratize information without compromising intellectual rigor.</p>"}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"greg-crane","slug":"greg-crane"}}],"department":null,"institution":"Tufts University","title":"Professor of Classics and Winnick Family Chair of Technology and Entrepreneurship"}}]}}],"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"greg-crane","slug":"greg-crane"}}],"department":null,"institution":"Tufts University","title":"Professor of Classics and Winnick Family Chair of Technology and Entrepreneurship"}}],"linked_participant_affiliations":null,"linked_participants":null,"linked_links":null,"linked_research_item":null,"linked_posts":[{"data":{"author":"digital-dialogues","author_name":"Digital Dialogues","post_date":"September 17, 2008","slug":"923-mith-digital-dialogue-joyce-ray-cyberinfrastructure-and-the-future-of-libraries","record_id":"recNYjrWmBtPz90Yq","post_title":"9/23 MITH Digital Dialogue: Joyce Ray, \"Cyberinfrastructure and the Future of Libraries.\""}},{"data":{"author":"digital-dialogues","author_name":"Digital Dialogues","post_date":"April 24, 2008","slug":"april-29th-digital-dialogue-greg-crane-cyberinfrastructure-for-global-cultural-heritage","record_id":"recjBpKMzDVMJ6lSn","post_title":"4/29 MITH Digital Dialogue: Greg Crane"}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
