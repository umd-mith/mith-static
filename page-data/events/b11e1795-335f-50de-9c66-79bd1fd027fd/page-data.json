The GSO plays classical arrangements of music and scores from popular video games; no tinny Pac-Man Fever jingles here, rather music that brings to life the richness and breadth of the complex auditory soundscapes surrounding contemporary games like Halo, World of Warcraft, and Final Fantasy.\nThe GSO is composed of students from UMD as well as the surrounding community. Join us for a discussion and samples of their unique performances with music director CHRIS APPLE, conductor and arranger GREG COX, and president JARRED YOUNG.\nFor more information, including photos and recordings of their music, visit the <a href=\"http://www.umgso.com/\">GSO</a>.</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Chris Apple, Greg Cox, Jarred Young Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"The Gamer Symphony Orchestra","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2008-02-12T17:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"name":"Chris Apple","affiliations":[{"title":"Music Director","department":"Gamer Symphony Orchestra","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"person_group":null,"slug":"chris-apple","new_id":402,"headshot":null},{"name":"Greg Cox","affiliations":[{"title":"Conductor and Arranger","department":"Gamer Symphony Orchestra","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"person_group":null,"slug":"greg-cox","new_id":433,"headshot":null},{"name":"Jarred Young","affiliations":[{"title":"President","department":"Gamer Symphony Orchestra","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"person_group":null,"slug":"jarred-young","new_id":446,"headshot":null}],"participants":[],"links":[],"sponsors":[],"partners":[],"research":[{"id":"mith-digital-dialogues","title":"Digital Dialogues","image":[{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v2/22/22/1700092800000/ETgCHh10ipX-pfzAuL2a4w/c8Tb8qufApHPOoBYJtOFNFEuDv0mxiMC1DE7SeZkc_cnJZgGC_0yxRLBD3j0UoZYrDrTGxgyqBSjm4GUnamoLsF1hxVgerbxsPqxPF2uyaaafkhnlfJ4WjGOSfqUull7B8A_5R4G-b_UpaFiYcRQ4Vjg2T_a_1OeQuL3RfMaOok/jtADp_yL0i2CPgtArFiIFY-RAksb1F3VrXBqJBCK9gM"}]}],"posts":[{"post_title":"2/12 MITH Digital Dialogue: The Gamer Symphony Orchestra","author":"digital-dialogues","author_name":"Digital Dialogues","post_date":"February 7, 2008","slug":"february-12th-digital-dialogue-the-gamer-symphony-orchestra"}],"disciplines":[],"methods":[]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
