This presentation examines the role of computer gaming in composition pedagogy, positioning games as objects of critique that are available for use in writing classes, and as locations of production for multimedia/multimodal texts. Using the example of massive multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), Dr. Eyman will present a five-part ecological framework for situating game activities as specific genres of production that can be used in writing classes.</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Douglas Eyman Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Play and Pedagogy","talk_subtitle":"Videogames and Writing Instruction","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2008-02-26T17:30:00.000Z","end":"2008-02-26T18:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"name":"Douglas Eyman","affiliations":[{"title":"Assistant Professor","department":"Department of English","institution":"George Mason University"}],"person_group":null,"slug":"douglas-eyman","new_id":422,"headshot":null,"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Douglas Eyman is an assistant professor of English at George Mason University; he received his PhD in Digital Rhetoric and Professional Writing from Michigan State University in 2007.
