With a panoply of visual, poetic, and musical records, the funeral survives as one of the most thoroughly documented Elizabethan public events, and the distribution of the funeral ephemera to the public made it possible for Sidney's contemporaries to recreate simulacra of the funeral in their own parlors. We will discuss why and how we have 're-done' this famous courtier-poet's obsequies, hopefully giving inspiration and insight to those of you who would like to direct similar projects. Extensive collaborative work, interdisciplinary and interinstitutional cooperation, and contributions from both grad and undergrad students have enabled us to create a project with both scholarly and pedagogical value on a low budget and with gusto.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Elizabeth Bearden, Stephanie Clarke-Graham, Elizabeth Martin, Michael Quilligan Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Renaissance Moving Pictures","talk_subtitle":"From Sidney's Funeral materials to Collaborative, Multimedia Nachleben","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2008-12-02T17:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Elizabeth  Bearden","slug":"elizabeth-bearden","new_id":426,"group_type":["External"],"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Bearden is working on a book entitled \"Emblematics of the Self: Ekphrasis and Identity in Renaissance Imitations of Greek romance,\" has published work in PMLA, and has a forthcoming article in JEMCS.
