Inspired by ARGs, the on-campus hunt made use of the technological affordances of the iPhone and iTouch – e.g., camera, phone, texting, and GPS functionality – to enhance interactivity and integrate the offline and online worlds in creative ways. The narrative framework was designed to teach students about University of Maryland history, particularly the Great Fire of 1912.</p>"}}}],"participants":[],"links":[{"title":"Institute Website","url":"http://dhcuration.org/institute/","type":"url"}],"sponsors":[{"name":"National Endowment for the Humanities","website":"neh.gov","type":"External","slug":"neh"}],"partners":[],"research":[{"id":"data-curation","title":"Digital Humanities Data Curation","image":[{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v2/22/22/1700092800000/PA3CXt8hdzDdt9DYB6zIGQ/X5BnPVwqhPBRW6QdD803gEss0YYLM-fqnJQNjT-xaKHGQUhTe0qhUDSCFA4bfrq-e_v_cwoM2BwFXg8tR9DDz1ZIl4H95bIesCLoMaGgSNy8x0tmnGMqTmxSpGn-5MG1AsalfI0Yu_Qo5M-J8B3iXM0fzbyDbqZ4t010VZDhxqo/8_dzgRyzYHwlCjFyRF1Wi8NrJkyMKrLu-HiHqB11Y1w"}]}],"posts":[],"disciplines":[],"methods":[]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
