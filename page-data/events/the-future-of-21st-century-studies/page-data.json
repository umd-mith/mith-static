The study of issues of pressing concern in the 21st century? The reconceptualization of historical studies in light of these concerns?

As the only center of its kind, C21 should take as its mission the development of 21st century studies as an interdisciplinary field. Doing so will allow C21 to set the terms of the debate about the future of 21st century studies for the decades ahead as well as to open the door for collaborations with other individuals and institutions interested in defining the future of 21st century studies.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Richard Grusin Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"The Future of 21st Century Studies","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2011-04-08T15:00:00.000Z","end":"2011-04-08T16:15:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Richard Grusin","slug":"richard-grusin","new_id":562,"group_type":["External"],"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Richard Grusin is Professor of English and Director of the Center for 21st Century Studies at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

His most recent book, <em>Premediation: Affect and Mediality After 9/11</em> (Palgrave, 2010), argues that in an era of heightened securitization, socially networked US and global media work to pre-mediate collective affects of anticipation and connectivity, while also perpetuating low levels of apprehension or fear.</p>"}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"richard-grusin","slug":"richard-grusin"}}],"department":null,"institution":"University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee","title":"Professor of English and Director of the Center for 21st Century Studies"}}]}}],"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"richard-grusin","slug":"richard-grusin"}}],"department":null,"institution":"University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee","title":"Professor of English and Director of the Center for 21st Century Studies"}}],"linked_participant_affiliations":null,"linked_participants":null,"linked_links":null,"linked_research_item":[{"data":{"id":"mith-digital-dialogues","title":"Digital Dialogues","image":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/e34e2/header_digital-dialogues..png","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/d61d9/header_digital-dialogues..png 350w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/40d29/header_digital-dialogues..png 700w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/e34e2/header_digital-dialogues..png 1400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/b6bd0/header_digital-dialogues..webp 350w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/c73ac/header_digital-dialogues..webp 700w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/b9745/header_digital-dialogues..webp 1400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":400}}}]}}}],"linked_posts":[{"data":{"author":"digital-dialogues","author_name":"Digital Dialogues","post_date":"April 1, 2011","slug":"48-mith-digital-dialogue-richard-grusin-the-future-of-21st-century-studies","record_id":"rec4PKBejnTUDbMXW","post_title":"4/8 MITH Digital Dialogue: Richard Grusin, \"The Future of 21st Century Studies\""}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
