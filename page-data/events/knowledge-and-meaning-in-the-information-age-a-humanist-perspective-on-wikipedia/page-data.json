But, while Wikipedia was born online, many of the ideas that inform its composition have long histories. Human beings have strived to give order to knowledge in the face of worries about information overload for ages. Their various responses have been shaped by the cultural norms, social needs, and technological possibilities of their historical contexts. This talk will focus on the old media precedents for Wikipedia’s new media success story to explore what reciprocal relationships they reveal between concepts like knowledge and information and the technologies we design to build and distribute them.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Melanie Kill Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Knowledge and Meaning in the Information Age","talk_subtitle":"A Humanist Perspective on Wikipedia","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2012-02-14T17:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Melanie  Kill","slug":"melanie-kill","new_id":500,"group_type":["External"],"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#d8d8d8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/c6fb4c296ea781783dcc71798d704f2e/1e7fb/melanie-kill..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/c6fb4c296ea781783dcc71798d704f2e/2d751/melanie-kill..jpg 50w,\n/mith-static/static/c6fb4c296ea781783dcc71798d704f2e/a31fa/melanie-kill..jpg 100w,\n/mith-static/static/c6fb4c296ea781783dcc71798d704f2e/1e7fb/melanie-kill..jpg 200w","sizes":"(min-width: 200px) 200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/c6fb4c296ea781783dcc71798d704f2e/b3787/melanie-kill..webp 50w,\n/mith-static/static/c6fb4c296ea781783dcc71798d704f2e/a75d2/melanie-kill..webp 100w,\n/mith-static/static/c6fb4c296ea781783dcc71798d704f2e/7f086/melanie-kill..webp 200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 200px) 200px, 100vw"}]},"width":200,"height":182.99999999999997}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"melanie-kill","slug":"melanie-kill"}}],"department":null,"institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Assistant Professor"}}]}}],"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"melanie-kill","slug":"melanie-kill"}}],"department":null,"institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Assistant Professor"}}],"linked_participant_affiliations":null,"linked_participants":null,"linked_links":[{"data":{"title":"View Video","url":"https://vimeo.com/731866401","type":"file_link"}},{"data":{"title":"Watch Keynote","url":"https://archive.org/download/dd_2012_02_14/dd_2012_02_14.key","type":"file_link"}},{"data":{"title":"View Slides","url":"https://archive.mith.umd.edu/mith-2020/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/dd_2012_02_14.pdf","type":"attachment"}}],"linked_research_item":[{"data":{"id":"mith-digital-dialogues","title":"Digital Dialogues","image":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/e34e2/header_digital-dialogues..png","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/d61d9/header_digital-dialogues..png 350w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/40d29/header_digital-dialogues..png 700w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/e34e2/header_digital-dialogues..png 1400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/b6bd0/header_digital-dialogues..webp 350w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/c73ac/header_digital-dialogues..webp 700w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/b9745/header_digital-dialogues..webp 1400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":400}}}]}}}],"linked_posts":[{"data":{"author":"digital-dialogues","author_name":"Digital Dialogues","post_date":"February 8, 2012","slug":"214-mith-digital-dialogue-melanie-kill-knowledge-and-meaning-in-the-information-age-a-humanist-perspective-on-wikipedia","record_id":"recW39UpbI0ZqHgE5","post_title":"2/14 MITH Digital Dialogue: Melanie Kill, “Knowledge and Meaning in the Information Age: A Humanist Perspective on Wikipedia”"}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["196133661","2857345991"],"slicesMap":{}}
