This talk thinks through “sustainability” across multiple registers to ask what we mean, and to whom we refer, when we invoke “sustainability” in our discussions of the digital humanities. Beginning with an overview of the Endings Principles, this talk will reflect on some of its more contentious dictums—such as “no dependencies”—as a way to consider not only the formal technical mechanisms for creating sustainable projects in the digital humanities, but also the social and political stakes of enacting them.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Joey Takeda Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Sustaining DH","talk_subtitle":"Endings, Dependencies, Infrastructure","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2024-04-09T16:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Joey  Takeda","slug":"joey-takeda","new_id":632,"group_type":["External"],"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#a8a8a8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/1c9341dc28ae0777c35eb35f8ff1bd2f/8f95c/Takeda_Headshot..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/1c9341dc28ae0777c35eb35f8ff1bd2f/28380/Takeda_Headshot..jpg 500w,\n/mith-static/static/1c9341dc28ae0777c35eb35f8ff1bd2f/1b035/Takeda_Headshot..jpg 1000w,\n/mith-static/static/1c9341dc28ae0777c35eb35f8ff1bd2f/8f95c/Takeda_Headshot..jpg 2000w","sizes":"(min-width: 2000px) 2000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/1c9341dc28ae0777c35eb35f8ff1bd2f/76f01/Takeda_Headshot..webp 500w,\n/mith-static/static/1c9341dc28ae0777c35eb35f8ff1bd2f/b7ef5/Takeda_Headshot..webp 1000w,\n/mith-static/static/1c9341dc28ae0777c35eb35f8ff1bd2f/d6ae7/Takeda_Headshot..webp 2000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 2000px) 2000px, 100vw"}]},"width":2000,"height":1334}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"joey-takeda","slug":"joey-takeda"}}],"department":"Digital Humanities Innovation Lab","institution":"Simon Fraser University","title":"Developer"}}]}}],"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"joey-takeda","slug":"joey-takeda"}}],"department":"Digital Humanities Innovation Lab","institution":"Simon Fraser University","title":"Developer"}}],"linked_participant_affiliations":null,"linked_participants":null,"linked_links":null,"linked_research_item":[{"data":{"id":"mith-digital-dialogues","title":"Digital Dialogues","image":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/e34e2/header_digital-dialogues..png","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/d61d9/header_digital-dialogues..png 350w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/40d29/header_digital-dialogues..png 700w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/e34e2/header_digital-dialogues..png 1400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/b6bd0/header_digital-dialogues..webp 350w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/c73ac/header_digital-dialogues..webp 700w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/b9745/header_digital-dialogues..webp 1400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":400}}}]}}}],"linked_posts":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["196133661","2857345991"],"slicesMap":{}}
