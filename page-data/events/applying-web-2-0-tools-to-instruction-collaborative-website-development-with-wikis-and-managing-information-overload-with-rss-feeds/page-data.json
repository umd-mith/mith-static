Web 2.0 applications tend to be centered around the user by making the experience easy, allowing for flexibility and providing opportunities for the user to customize their access to information. The collaborative nature and ease of use of many of Web 2.0 tools have been embraced by faculty in the College of Arts and Humanities (ARHU). This session will introduce the basics of wiki software and share examples of its pedagogical applications. In addition, applications integrating RSS feeds to organize and share content such as audio, text and bookmarks will be introduced. These technologies have satisfied important objectives for ARHU faculty. Further discussion through this Digitial Dialogue will provide the opportunity to identify additional uses and contexts for these tools.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Janel Brennan-Tillmann, Catherine Hays Zabriskie Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Applying Web 2.0 Tools to Instruction: Collaborative Website Development with Wikis and Managing Information Overload with RSS Feeds","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2007-03-06T17:30:00.000Z","end":"2007-03-06T18:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Janel Brennan-Tillmann","slug":"janel-brennan-tillmann","new_id":444,"group_type":["External"],"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Janel works in the School of Languages, Literatures and Cultures in the College of Arts &#x26; Humanities, where she is both an academic technologist and an instructional designer who works with faculty to explore, create and integrate technology and multimedia resources into their language and literature courses.
