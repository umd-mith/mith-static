I will begin this talk with a brief description of the history of this work at Brown, including the NEH-sponsored project to create an on-line scholarly community for a poetry course in 1976, and the ways in which a recent system, Touch Art Gallery, is being used by courses at Brown, the Nobel Foundation and the Massachusetts Historical Society. Then I will shift to the main focus, a live demo of an early version of the latest multi-format hypermedia system my group is building to support information gathering, sense-making (including organizing, annotating, relationship-building through linking, grouping and visualizations), and ultimately presenting multimedia information. We are especially interested in supporting small workgroup collaboration and the use of pen- and touch-computing on tablets and large interactive whiteboards.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Andy van Dam Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"‘Five Decades of Experiments with Hypermedia Systems for the Humanities’","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2016-04-26T16:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Andy  Van Dam","slug":"andries-van-dam","new_id":205,"group_type":["External"],"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#989898","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/b367331ce840c909b39277d2d2019bd7/624fc/Andy-Van-Dam-photo..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/b367331ce840c909b39277d2d2019bd7/39a87/Andy-Van-Dam-photo..jpg 204w,\n/mith-static/static/b367331ce840c909b39277d2d2019bd7/d7a2f/Andy-Van-Dam-photo..jpg 408w,\n/mith-static/static/b367331ce840c909b39277d2d2019bd7/624fc/Andy-Van-Dam-photo..jpg 816w","sizes":"(min-width: 816px) 816px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/b367331ce840c909b39277d2d2019bd7/08b10/Andy-Van-Dam-photo..webp 204w,\n/mith-static/static/b367331ce840c909b39277d2d2019bd7/7c9f7/Andy-Van-Dam-photo..webp 408w,\n/mith-static/static/b367331ce840c909b39277d2d2019bd7/2555c/Andy-Van-Dam-photo..webp 816w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 816px) 816px, 100vw"}]},"width":816,"height":919}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"andries-van-dam","slug":"andries-van-dam"}}],"department":null,"institution":"Brown University","title":"Professor of Technology and Education and Professor of Computer Science"}}]}}],"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"andries-van-dam","slug":"andries-van-dam"}}],"department":null,"institution":"Brown University","title":"Professor of Technology and Education and Professor of Computer Science"}}],"linked_participant_affiliations":null,"linked_participants":null,"linked_links":[{"data":{"title":"Storify Link","url":"https://storify.com/digdialog/digital-dialogu","type":"file_link"}}],"linked_research_item":[{"data":{"id":"mith-digital-dialogues","title":"Digital Dialogues","image":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/e34e2/header_digital-dialogues..png","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/d61d9/header_digital-dialogues..png 350w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/40d29/header_digital-dialogues..png 700w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/e34e2/header_digital-dialogues..png 1400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/b6bd0/header_digital-dialogues..webp 350w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/c73ac/header_digital-dialogues..webp 700w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/b9745/header_digital-dialogues..webp 1400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":400}}}]}}}],"linked_posts":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["196133661","2857345991"],"slicesMap":{}}
