We will briefly discuss the types of considerations that go into deciding what tools or services to use. The majority of the time will be spent creating your own collections of data using one of four tools: <a href=\"https://mashe.hawksey.info/2013/02/twitter-archive-tagsv5/\">TAGS</a>, <a href=\"https://ifttt.com/recipes/254160-twitter-search-google-sheet\">IFTTT</a>, <a href=\"http://social-feed-manager.readthedocs.org/en/m5_002/\">Social Feed Manager</a> and <a href=\"http://github.com/edsu/twarc\">twarc</a>.\nThis is a hands on workshop, so please bring a laptop and ideas about the Twitter data you would like to collect. Also, if you are interested in using twarc, please install it prior to attending the workshop (installation details will be provided).</p>"}},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/82e76bfb7559ac47126ee4f2b2753745/716c3/1RHfiqZixkvlrgrPolMtpSlE9Zmpcb04aU5NAWfgqSs.png","srcSet":"/static/82e76bfb7559ac47126ee4f2b2753745/e1907/1RHfiqZixkvlrgrPolMtpSlE9Zmpcb04aU5NAWfgqSs.png 150w,\n/static/82e76bfb7559ac47126ee4f2b2753745/0ca00/1RHfiqZixkvlrgrPolMtpSlE9Zmpcb04aU5NAWfgqSs.png 300w,\n/static/82e76bfb7559ac47126ee4f2b2753745/716c3/1RHfiqZixkvlrgrPolMtpSlE9Zmpcb04aU5NAWfgqSs.png 600w","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/82e76bfb7559ac47126ee4f2b2753745/b41db/1RHfiqZixkvlrgrPolMtpSlE9Zmpcb04aU5NAWfgqSs.webp 150w,\n/static/82e76bfb7559ac47126ee4f2b2753745/9d5e2/1RHfiqZixkvlrgrPolMtpSlE9Zmpcb04aU5NAWfgqSs.webp 300w,\n/static/82e76bfb7559ac47126ee4f2b2753745/9a4d4/1RHfiqZixkvlrgrPolMtpSlE9Zmpcb04aU5NAWfgqSs.webp 600w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":700}}}},"event_title":"Session II: Methods and Tools for Building Collections of Social Media","talk_title":null,"talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Workshop"],"start":"2015-02-20T04:30:00.000Z","end":"2015-02-19T17:30:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room, Hornbake Library 0301","speakers":[{"name":"Ed Summers","affiliations":[{"title":"Research Faculty","department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"person_group":null,"slug":"ed-summers","new_id":8,"headshot":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#383838","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/f3b742ee2a90270ae9e28ac187dac62c/1f55a/VeGUPgS_cPSPJnn2wFIVrGhfvv1k92rYJRnJPg6mVtU.jpg","srcSet":"/static/f3b742ee2a90270ae9e28ac187dac62c/a7b73/VeGUPgS_cPSPJnn2wFIVrGhfvv1k92rYJRnJPg6mVtU.jpg 375w,\n/static/f3b742ee2a90270ae9e28ac187dac62c/0f5ce/VeGUPgS_cPSPJnn2wFIVrGhfvv1k92rYJRnJPg6mVtU.jpg 750w,\n/static/f3b742ee2a90270ae9e28ac187dac62c/1f55a/VeGUPgS_cPSPJnn2wFIVrGhfvv1k92rYJRnJPg6mVtU.jpg 1500w","sizes":"(min-width: 1500px) 1500px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/f3b742ee2a90270ae9e28ac187dac62c/e3305/VeGUPgS_cPSPJnn2wFIVrGhfvv1k92rYJRnJPg6mVtU.webp 375w,\n/static/f3b742ee2a90270ae9e28ac187dac62c/4f03f/VeGUPgS_cPSPJnn2wFIVrGhfvv1k92rYJRnJPg6mVtU.webp 750w,\n/static/f3b742ee2a90270ae9e28ac187dac62c/07142/VeGUPgS_cPSPJnn2wFIVrGhfvv1k92rYJRnJPg6mVtU.webp 1500w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1500px) 1500px, 100vw"}]},"width":1500,"height":1500}}},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Ed is a researcher and software developer working at the intersection of information technology and memory studies.
