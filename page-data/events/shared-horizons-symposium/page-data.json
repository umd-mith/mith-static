Bringing together researchers from the digital humanities and bioinformatics communities, the symposium will explore ways in which these two communities might fruitfully collaborate on projects that bridge the humanities and medicine around the topics of sequence alignment and network analysis, two modes of analysis that intersect with “big data.”</p>"}},"image":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/7aabab5a6d0e6813fb34be9843be3ea9/8860e/event_shared-horizons..jpg","srcSet":"/static/7aabab5a6d0e6813fb34be9843be3ea9/42c27/event_shared-horizons..jpg 150w,\n/static/7aabab5a6d0e6813fb34be9843be3ea9/532ef/event_shared-horizons..jpg 300w,\n/static/7aabab5a6d0e6813fb34be9843be3ea9/8860e/event_shared-horizons..jpg 600w","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/7aabab5a6d0e6813fb34be9843be3ea9/b41db/event_shared-horizons..webp 150w,\n/static/7aabab5a6d0e6813fb34be9843be3ea9/9d5e2/event_shared-horizons..webp 300w,\n/static/7aabab5a6d0e6813fb34be9843be3ea9/9a4d4/event_shared-horizons..webp 600w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":700}}}]},"event_title":"Shared Horizons Symposium","talk_title":"Shared Horizons","talk_subtitle":"Data, Biomedicine, and the Digital Humanities","type":["Symposium"],"start":"2013-04-11T04:00:00.000Z","end":"2013-04-12T04:00:00.000Z","location":"University of Maryland, College Park","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"David B.
