A legal compendium of about 200 AD/CE , the Mishnah is also significant for understanding late-second-century Jews in Palestine. Yet no critical edition of the text exists. The Digital Mishnah Project aims to produce a born-digital edition that will take into account the full array of manuscript and other evidence, and automate the process of comparing variant readings and assessing the relationships between manuscripts.\nConceived as a tool rather than an edition, the Project will certainly make it easier for those who wish to track the text back to its earliest form to do so. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that its contribution to medieval book culture. As a tool, its design should draw on but also further develop the resources for other such editions, in any language.\nThe presentation will feature a demo, followed by a discussion of some of preliminary observations.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Hayim Lapin Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"A Digital Edition of A Classical Hebrew Text: The Digital Mishnah Project","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2012-12-04T17:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Hayim Lapin","slug":"hayim-lapin","new_id":126,"group_type":["Past","External"],"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#d8d8c8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/598592169ce7b7450e8259e050d01b0b/0fdf4/hayim-lapin..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/598592169ce7b7450e8259e050d01b0b/91a6d/hayim-lapin..jpg 75w,\n/mith-static/static/598592169ce7b7450e8259e050d01b0b/96deb/hayim-lapin..jpg 150w,\n/mith-static/static/598592169ce7b7450e8259e050d01b0b/0fdf4/hayim-lapin..jpg 300w","sizes":"(min-width: 300px) 300px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/598592169ce7b7450e8259e050d01b0b/18188/hayim-lapin..webp 75w,\n/mith-static/static/598592169ce7b7450e8259e050d01b0b/c65bc/hayim-lapin..webp 150w,\n/mith-static/static/598592169ce7b7450e8259e050d01b0b/078c3/hayim-lapin..webp 300w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 300px) 300px, 100vw"}]},"width":300,"height":300}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p><strong>Hayim Lapin</strong> is the Robert H.

His most recent book is on the development of the rabbinic movement in Palestine in the third and fourth centuries of the Common Era (AD) seen from the perspective of Roman provincial history. His current project, drawing on the same body of literature, is a digital scholarly edition of a principal legal text known as the Mishnah.</p>"}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"hayim-lapin","slug":"hayim-lapin"}}],"department":null,"institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Robert H.
