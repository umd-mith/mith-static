In this talk, Professor Mills Kelly, Associate Director of the Center for History and New Media, will discuss the results of a recent course he taught called \"Lying About the Past\" in which his students created an online historical hoax that fooled a fair number of people (including several professors). Along the way the students worked harder than any group of students he's taught in more than a dozen years in the college classroom. What lessons can we learn about teaching and digital culture from his experiences? Come to the talk and find out.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Mills Kelly Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"What Happens When You Teach Students to Lie Online?","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2009-04-21T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2009-04-21T17:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Mills Kelly","slug":"mills-kelly","new_id":504,"group_type":["External"],"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"mills-kelly","slug":"mills-kelly"}}],"department":null,"institution":"George Mason University","title":"Associate Dean for Enrollment Development"}}]}}],"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"mills-kelly","slug":"mills-kelly"}}],"department":null,"institution":"George Mason University","title":"Associate Dean for Enrollment Development"}},{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"mills-kelly","slug":"mills-kelly"}}],"department":"Center for History and New Media","institution":"George Mason University","title":"Associate Director"}},{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"mills-kelly","slug":"mills-kelly"}}],"department":"Department of History and Art History","institution":"George Mason University","title":"Associate Professor"}}],"linked_participant_affiliations":null,"linked_participants":null,"linked_links":null,"linked_research_item":[{"data":{"id":"mith-digital-dialogues","title":"Digital Dialogues","image":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/e34e2/header_digital-dialogues..png","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/d61d9/header_digital-dialogues..png 350w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/40d29/header_digital-dialogues..png 700w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/e34e2/header_digital-dialogues..png 1400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/b6bd0/header_digital-dialogues..webp 350w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/c73ac/header_digital-dialogues..webp 700w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/b9745/header_digital-dialogues..webp 1400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":400}}}]}}}],"linked_posts":[{"data":{"author":"digital-dialogues","author_name":"Digital Dialogues","post_date":"April 15, 2009","slug":"421-mith-digital-dialogue-mills-kelly-what-happens-when-you-teach-students-to-lie-online","record_id":"recFpZxLwyU5eMObD","post_title":"4/21 MITH Digital Dialogue: Mills Kelly, \"What Happens When You Teach Students to Lie Online?\""}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
