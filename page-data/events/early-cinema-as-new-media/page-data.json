Rather than treat the body as primarily marking identity—gendered, racial, national—or invoke it to make claims about early cinema's sensational attractions in relation to modernity (two common approaches to the subject), I begin by focusing on films that reveal striking anxieties and preoccupations about persons on public display, both exceptional figures, such as 1896 presidential candidate William McKinley, as well as ordinary people self-consciously caught by the movie camera in their daily routines. The book closes with a meditation on early cinema and death (when the body stops moving), with implications for new media and technology studies more generally.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Jonathan Auerbach Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Early Cinema as New Media","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2008-04-22T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2008-04-22T17:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Jonathan  Auerbach","slug":"jonathan-auerbach","new_id":462,"group_type":["External"],"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#684828","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/43d7b37332d55e214063a5f25bbf51dc/9d298/Jonathan-Auerbach..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/43d7b37332d55e214063a5f25bbf51dc/67094/Jonathan-Auerbach..jpg 350w,\n/mith-static/static/43d7b37332d55e214063a5f25bbf51dc/10a6f/Jonathan-Auerbach..jpg 700w,\n/mith-static/static/43d7b37332d55e214063a5f25bbf51dc/9d298/Jonathan-Auerbach..jpg 1400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/43d7b37332d55e214063a5f25bbf51dc/a9c60/Jonathan-Auerbach..webp 350w,\n/mith-static/static/43d7b37332d55e214063a5f25bbf51dc/e1299/Jonathan-Auerbach..webp 700w,\n/mith-static/static/43d7b37332d55e214063a5f25bbf51dc/64ed2/Jonathan-Auerbach..webp 1400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":1050}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>In addition to publishing a variety of articles on nineteenth and twentieth American literature and film, and editing a number of volumes, Jonathan Auerbach is the author of five books: <em>Weapons of Democracy: Propaganda, Progressivism, and American Public Opinion</em> (Johns Hopkins University Press, forthcoming 2015);<em>Dark Borders: Film Noir and American Citizenship</em> (Duke UP, 2011); <em>Body Shots: Early Cinema's Incarnations</em>(California, 2007); <em>Male Call: Becoming Jack London</em> (Duke UP, 1996); and <em>The Romance of Failure: First-Person Fictions of Poe, Hawthorne, and James</em> (Oxford UP, 1989).  </p>"}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"jonathan-auerbach","slug":"jonathan-auerbach"}}],"department":null,"institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Professor of English"}}]}}],"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":[{"data":{"term":"History","type":"Discipline"}},{"data":{"term":"Film and cinema arts studies","type":"Discipline"}},{"data":{"term":"Media studies","type":"Discipline"}}],"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"jonathan-auerbach","slug":"jonathan-auerbach"}}],"department":null,"institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Professor of English"}}],"linked_participant_affiliations":null,"linked_participants":null,"linked_links":null,"linked_research_item":[{"data":{"id":"mith-digital-dialogues","title":"Digital Dialogues","image":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/e34e2/header_digital-dialogues..png","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/d61d9/header_digital-dialogues..png 350w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/40d29/header_digital-dialogues..png 700w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/e34e2/header_digital-dialogues..png 1400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/b6bd0/header_digital-dialogues..webp 350w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/c73ac/header_digital-dialogues..webp 700w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/b9745/header_digital-dialogues..webp 1400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":400}}}]}}}],"linked_posts":[{"data":{"author":"digital-dialogues","author_name":"Digital Dialogues","post_date":"April 18, 2008","slug":"april-22nd-digital-dialogue-jonathan-auerbach-early-cinema-as-new-media","record_id":"recrWtimCTo0keGfi","post_title":"4/22 MITH Digital Dialogue: Jonathan Auerbach, \"Early Cinema as New Media\""}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
