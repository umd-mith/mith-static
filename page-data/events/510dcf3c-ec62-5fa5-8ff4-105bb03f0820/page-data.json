The Quilt literally stitches together a million memories, a million stories, a million lessons about the relationship between individual lives, public culture, and political activism. In its textile form, it is an unwieldy archive. If laid out in its entirety the Quilt would cover more than 1.3 million square feet. It weighs more than 34 tons.\nThis presentation discusses the creation of an interactive memorial that was designed to augment the viewing of the textile Quilt. I will demonstrate three digital experiences: 1) an open-source mobile web application called AIDS QUILT TOUCH; 2) a tangible tabletop interactive that enables viewers to SEARCH the database of Quilt images to find a specific image and to BROWSE the archive of Quilt panel images; and 3) a community sourcing application that engages people in analyzing and archiving information about the Quilt.\nThis effort is framed by my recent transmedia book project called <em>Designing Culture: The Technological Imagination At Work</em>. In creating the Quilt Digital Experiences I was interested in exploring the cultural work of public interactives, to examine how they are implicated in practices of cultural reproduction—remembering, witnessing, archiving, and educating.</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Anne Balsamo Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Heavy Data, Cultural Memories","talk_subtitle":"Lessons from the AIDS Memorial Quilt Digital Experience Project","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2014-02-18T17:30:00.000Z","end":"2014-02-18T18:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"name":"Anne Balsamo","affiliations":[{"title":"Dean and Professor of Media Studies","department":null,"institution":"The New School for Public Engagement"}],"person_group":null,"slug":"anne-balsamo","new_id":385,"headshot":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#484838","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/009f8abb153f525cc919eff32421a28e/0fdf4/o6nJ7gqESQIQ1YwwFODhRZzeuUKkCfOVMiqeEJPb2uQ.jpg","srcSet":"/static/009f8abb153f525cc919eff32421a28e/91a6d/o6nJ7gqESQIQ1YwwFODhRZzeuUKkCfOVMiqeEJPb2uQ.jpg 75w,\n/static/009f8abb153f525cc919eff32421a28e/96deb/o6nJ7gqESQIQ1YwwFODhRZzeuUKkCfOVMiqeEJPb2uQ.jpg 150w,\n/static/009f8abb153f525cc919eff32421a28e/0fdf4/o6nJ7gqESQIQ1YwwFODhRZzeuUKkCfOVMiqeEJPb2uQ.jpg 300w","sizes":"(min-width: 300px) 300px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/009f8abb153f525cc919eff32421a28e/18188/o6nJ7gqESQIQ1YwwFODhRZzeuUKkCfOVMiqeEJPb2uQ.webp 75w,\n/static/009f8abb153f525cc919eff32421a28e/c65bc/o6nJ7gqESQIQ1YwwFODhRZzeuUKkCfOVMiqeEJPb2uQ.webp 150w,\n/static/009f8abb153f525cc919eff32421a28e/078c3/o6nJ7gqESQIQ1YwwFODhRZzeuUKkCfOVMiqeEJPb2uQ.webp 300w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 300px) 300px, 100vw"}]},"width":300,"height":300}}},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Dr. Balsamo is a groundbreaking national leader in media studies, a scholar and media-maker whose work links cultural studies, digital humanities, and interactive media. She received her PhD in Communications Research from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and began her faculty career in the School of Literature, Culture, and Communications at Georgia Tech, where she published a distinguished book about the cultural implications of emergent biotechnologies, Technologies of the Gendered Body: Reading Cyborg Women. In 1999, having grown interested in the practical linkages between technology and culture, she accepted an offer to join the celebrated Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), collaborating in the design of media for reading, exhibition, public art, and cultural projects. In 2003, Dr. Balsamo moved from Silicon Valley to USC, where she had been jointly appointed in the Annenberg School of Communications and the School of Cinematic Arts. She directed the Collaborative Design Lab within the Interactive Design Division of the School of Cinematic Arts. She has been a leader in the growth of digital humanities nationally, serving on the Advisory Board of HASTAC (Humanities, Arts, Science, and Technology Advanced Co-laboratory) since its founding in 2003. In 2011, she published Designing Culture: The Technological Imagination at Work, a transmedia book (with accompanying DVD and web linkages to interactive media projects) that synthesizes and theorizes the links between her cultural studies scholarship and digital media projects.</p>"}}}],"participants":[],"links":[],"sponsors":[],"partners":[],"research":[{"id":"mith-digital-dialogues","title":"Digital Dialogues","image":[{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v2/22/22/1700092800000/ETgCHh10ipX-pfzAuL2a4w/c8Tb8qufApHPOoBYJtOFNFEuDv0mxiMC1DE7SeZkc_cnJZgGC_0yxRLBD3j0UoZYrDrTGxgyqBSjm4GUnamoLsF1hxVgerbxsPqxPF2uyaaafkhnlfJ4WjGOSfqUull7B8A_5R4G-b_UpaFiYcRQ4Vjg2T_a_1OeQuL3RfMaOok/jtADp_yL0i2CPgtArFiIFY-RAksb1F3VrXBqJBCK9gM"}]}],"posts":[],"disciplines":[],"methods":[]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
