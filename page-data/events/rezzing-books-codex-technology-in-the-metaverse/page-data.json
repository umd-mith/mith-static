At the center of this nexus of users is the book itself, a virtual artifact that differs from its physical counterpart by being comprised of bits, not atoms; of textures, animated scripts, and geometric primitives rather than paper, ink, cloth, and thread. In this talk I will examine the infrastructure that supports this in-world bibliographic culture: specifically, the technologies used to create and read SL books; the social networks designed to promote and popularize them; the information services to collect, access, curate, and catalogue them; and the legal and economic systems developed to commodify them. I will look at how the Second Life platform conditions our ideas of \"bookness\" by presenting us with interfaces for reading that borrow incongruously from print and manuscript traditions, first-person shooter games, and even military aviation. And I will suggest that the mixed economy of Real Life and Second Life makes it necessary to understand these immersive books as compound objects that exist within a system of relationships that include both in-world and out-world content, thereby complicating efforts to study, link, document, and preserve them. The talk will also include a demonstration of books I have made in SL and discuss future projects.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Kari Kraus Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Rezzing Books: Codex Technology in the Metaverse","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2008-04-15T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2008-04-15T17:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Kari Kraus","slug":"kari-kraus","new_id":293,"group_type":["External"],"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#788848","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/6c75d38bd3b0f6a40bcae61b1afd6ba5/47930/Kari_Kraus_(karikraus)__Twitter..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/6c75d38bd3b0f6a40bcae61b1afd6ba5/e07e1/Kari_Kraus_(karikraus)__Twitter..jpg 100w,\n/mith-static/static/6c75d38bd3b0f6a40bcae61b1afd6ba5/dd515/Kari_Kraus_(karikraus)__Twitter..jpg 200w,\n/mith-static/static/6c75d38bd3b0f6a40bcae61b1afd6ba5/47930/Kari_Kraus_(karikraus)__Twitter..jpg 400w","sizes":"(min-width: 400px) 400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/6c75d38bd3b0f6a40bcae61b1afd6ba5/d8057/Kari_Kraus_(karikraus)__Twitter..webp 100w,\n/mith-static/static/6c75d38bd3b0f6a40bcae61b1afd6ba5/2e34e/Kari_Kraus_(karikraus)__Twitter..webp 200w,\n/mith-static/static/6c75d38bd3b0f6a40bcae61b1afd6ba5/416c3/Kari_Kraus_(karikraus)__Twitter..webp 400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 400px) 400px, 100vw"}]},"width":400,"height":400}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"kari-kraus","slug":"kari-kraus"}}],"department":"College of Information Studies and the Department of English","institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Assistant Professor"}}]}}],"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"kari-kraus","slug":"kari-kraus"}}],"department":"College of Information Studies and the Department of English","institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Assistant Professor"}}],"linked_participant_affiliations":null,"linked_participants":null,"linked_links":null,"linked_research_item":[{"data":{"id":"mith-digital-dialogues","title":"Digital Dialogues","image":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/e34e2/header_digital-dialogues..png","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/d61d9/header_digital-dialogues..png 350w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/40d29/header_digital-dialogues..png 700w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/e34e2/header_digital-dialogues..png 1400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/b6bd0/header_digital-dialogues..webp 350w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/c73ac/header_digital-dialogues..webp 700w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/b9745/header_digital-dialogues..webp 1400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":400}}}]}}}],"linked_posts":[{"data":{"author":"digital-dialogues","author_name":"Digital Dialogues","post_date":"April 10, 2008","slug":"april-15th-digital-dialogue-kari-kraus-rezzing-books-codex-technology-in-the-metaverse","record_id":"recONmaGMGR7UElrk","post_title":"4/15 MITH Digital Dialogue: Kari Kraus, \"Rezzing Books: Codex Technology in the Metaverse\""}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
