The gestural characteristics of the speakers from different regions, while unique to the speaker, are also unique to the culture of the region and help the researcher to acquire the sounds intrinsic to that dialect or accent by the formation of the lips and use of the vocal and articulatory musculature. As a crowd-sourced website, or \"wiki\", the Visual Accent Dialect Archive has the potential to attract dialect and accent donations from all over the world. Donors may speak a story, or a list of words, or a paragraph. Once the VADA website is populated, researchers can click on a specific region, country, or state and locate the specific dialect or accent. In addition to being a central resource for performers, the website provides excellent cultural information for anthropologists and linguists.</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Leigh Wilson Smiley Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Vocal Visions","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2012-02-28T17:30:00.000Z","end":"2012-02-28T18:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Seminar Room","speakers":[{"name":"Leigh Wilson Smiley","affiliations":[{"title":"Associate Professor","department":"School of Theatre, Dance, and Performance Studies","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"person_group":null,"slug":"leigh-wilson-smiley","new_id":147,"headshot":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/29a6d071fd6529a1f466f8bd4c437e4f/37bcf/B1bMFUvjyd_rnaHC9yqGUBFw3O_yOeriUqPKCNpUacY.jpg","srcSet":"/static/29a6d071fd6529a1f466f8bd4c437e4f/61121/B1bMFUvjyd_rnaHC9yqGUBFw3O_yOeriUqPKCNpUacY.jpg 41w,\n/static/29a6d071fd6529a1f466f8bd4c437e4f/27cb8/B1bMFUvjyd_rnaHC9yqGUBFw3O_yOeriUqPKCNpUacY.jpg 82w,\n/static/29a6d071fd6529a1f466f8bd4c437e4f/37bcf/B1bMFUvjyd_rnaHC9yqGUBFw3O_yOeriUqPKCNpUacY.jpg 163w","sizes":"(min-width: 163px) 163px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/29a6d071fd6529a1f466f8bd4c437e4f/e7364/B1bMFUvjyd_rnaHC9yqGUBFw3O_yOeriUqPKCNpUacY.webp 41w,\n/static/29a6d071fd6529a1f466f8bd4c437e4f/4f783/B1bMFUvjyd_rnaHC9yqGUBFw3O_yOeriUqPKCNpUacY.webp 82w,\n/static/29a6d071fd6529a1f466f8bd4c437e4f/971ed/B1bMFUvjyd_rnaHC9yqGUBFw3O_yOeriUqPKCNpUacY.webp 163w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 163px) 163px, 100vw"}]},"width":163,"height":225}}},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Leigh Wilson Smiley is a professional actor and expert on voice, accents, and dialects. She is the Associate Director of Theatre, and the Head of the MFA in Performance Program in the School of Theatre, Dance, and Performance Studies at the University of Maryland College Park. With the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities Leigh created the first website to focus on both the visual as well as the auditory characteristics of accent and dialect called <em>The Visual Accent &#x26; Dialect Archive</em> (acronym VADA). Amongst the companies with whom Leigh consults are: Shakespeare &#x26; Company in Lenox, Massachusetts; Ford’s Theatre; Folger Shakespeare Theatre; Signature Theatre; Pig Iron Theatre; Cirque de Soliel; and NBC Washington.</p>"}}}],"participants":[],"links":[{"title":"Watch Keynote","url":"https://archive.org/download/dd_2012_02_28/dd_2012_02_28.key","type":"file_link"},{"title":"View Slides","url":"https://archive.mith.umd.edu/mith-2020/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/dd_2012_02_28.pdf","type":"attachment"},{"title":"VADA Website","url":"http://visualaccentdialectarchive.com","type":"url"}],"sponsors":[],"partners":[],"research":[{"id":"mith-digital-dialogues","title":"Digital Dialogues","image":[{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v2/22/22/1700092800000/ETgCHh10ipX-pfzAuL2a4w/c8Tb8qufApHPOoBYJtOFNFEuDv0mxiMC1DE7SeZkc_cnJZgGC_0yxRLBD3j0UoZYrDrTGxgyqBSjm4GUnamoLsF1hxVgerbxsPqxPF2uyaaafkhnlfJ4WjGOSfqUull7B8A_5R4G-b_UpaFiYcRQ4Vjg2T_a_1OeQuL3RfMaOok/jtADp_yL0i2CPgtArFiIFY-RAksb1F3VrXBqJBCK9gM"}]},{"id":"vada","title":"Visual Accent and Dialect Archive (VADA)","image":[{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v2/22/22/1700092800000/rmnUUhlBTHJZEfObZYxGLw/hoynhTAFz6GzCdTh4AyEPWUtk9S6je_9TQOJNZiguPiSQmq9hpgug3mvfemdFpVR6DyiyXNRnMaFZnWYos7hS5gaGDPM7ZjShCy3OOU6qpjupbSvB8zFqWx5teOtE9yoXPitgBQPW_veINfj76XSrgiyuYHZ6Dg5GUFXh75lJ4E/XNi9PxB4hNVCRtmfSPoVmPMOBESMBMwcQ0chSEZGv_w"}]}],"posts":[{"post_title":"2/28 MITH Digital Dialogue: Leigh Wilson Smiley, \"Vocal Visions\"","author":"digital-dialogues","author_name":"Digital Dialogues","post_date":"February 22, 2012","slug":"228-mith-digital-dialogue-leigh-wilson-smiley-vocal-visions"}],"disciplines":[{"term":"Informatics","type":"Discipline"},{"term":"Performance Studies: Dance, Theatre","type":"Discipline"}],"methods":[{"term":"cultural analytics","type":"Method"},{"term":"digital archiving","type":"Method"},{"term":"speech processing analysis and methods","type":"Method"}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
