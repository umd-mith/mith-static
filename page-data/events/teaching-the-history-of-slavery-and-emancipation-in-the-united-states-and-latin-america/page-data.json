Central to that new world history—perhaps the first true world history—was the institution of slavery, as slaves provided the labor force that drove this new international economy. Thereafter, no one was untouched by the institution of chattel bondage. Any study of world history must address the institution of slavery, not only for its social and economic importance but also as a moral rupture that has not healed.\nWhat is true for the world is most certainly true for the United States. For most of American history, the United States was a slave society. Understanding slavery is critical to understanding American life.\nPerhaps for that reason, the history—meaning the changing nature—of slavery has been subjected to intensive investigation during the last generation. Over time and in different places, the slave experience changed radically. Understanding that—after all change is history’s essence—is critical to understanding slavery.\nSlavery is also ground zero for American race relations. Like slavery, race—the meaning of whiteness and blackness—changed over time. How and why it changed is also of critical importance.\nFinally, slavery does not exist only in history; it also exists in memory. Memory is profoundly different from history. It is the memory of slavery as much as its history that stirs recent studies of slavery in American culture and society.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Teaching the History of Slavery and Emancipation in the United States and Latin America","talk_title":null,"talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Workshop"],"start":"2002-10-15T04:00:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"Edison Center for Technology","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Ira  Berlin","slug":"ira-berlin","new_id":575,"group_type":["External"],"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Ira Berlin has written extensively on American history and the larger Atlantic world in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, particularly the history of slavery.
