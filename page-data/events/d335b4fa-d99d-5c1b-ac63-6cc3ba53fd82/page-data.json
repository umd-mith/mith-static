We can train a parser on Wall Street Journal text from the Penn Treebank, for example, and expect it to perform reasonably well on recent blog posts or movie reviews, but not necessarily on eighteenth-century conduct manuals. Unfortunately it's often hard to find or create appropriate training data for specific literary genres or historical periods, even in English. In this talk Travis Brown, Assistant Director of Research and Development at MITH, will look at some examples of semi-supervised and unsupervised methods that can be used to explore large text collections in domains with little or no available training data.</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Travis Brown Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Teaching Machines to Read Milton","talk_subtitle":"Natural Language Processing Challenges for Literary and Historical Texts","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2011-03-29T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2011-03-29T17:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"name":"Travis Brown","affiliations":[{"title":"Research & Development Software Developer","department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"person_group":null,"slug":"travis-brown","new_id":25,"headshot":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#181808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/031ab3d1549f0edb327982628d6179eb/544cb/HbZZObGLKzMTVYWsp6SVynVaBM4uLmjCcsl6uIqsIgM.jpg","srcSet":"/static/031ab3d1549f0edb327982628d6179eb/91a74/HbZZObGLKzMTVYWsp6SVynVaBM4uLmjCcsl6uIqsIgM.jpg 29w,\n/static/031ab3d1549f0edb327982628d6179eb/16bc2/HbZZObGLKzMTVYWsp6SVynVaBM4uLmjCcsl6uIqsIgM.jpg 58w,\n/static/031ab3d1549f0edb327982628d6179eb/544cb/HbZZObGLKzMTVYWsp6SVynVaBM4uLmjCcsl6uIqsIgM.jpg 115w","sizes":"(min-width: 115px) 115px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/031ab3d1549f0edb327982628d6179eb/bc2ec/HbZZObGLKzMTVYWsp6SVynVaBM4uLmjCcsl6uIqsIgM.webp 29w,\n/static/031ab3d1549f0edb327982628d6179eb/6262e/HbZZObGLKzMTVYWsp6SVynVaBM4uLmjCcsl6uIqsIgM.webp 58w,\n/static/031ab3d1549f0edb327982628d6179eb/1f876/HbZZObGLKzMTVYWsp6SVynVaBM4uLmjCcsl6uIqsIgM.webp 115w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 115px) 115px, 100vw"}]},"width":115,"height":150}}},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Travis Brown is a Research &#x26; Development Software Developer at MITH.
