The Ajax XML Encoder (AXE) allows users with limited technical knowledge to add metadata to text, image, video, and audio files. Users can collaboratively tag a text in TEI, associate XML with time stamps in video or audio files, and mark off regions of an image to be linked to external metadata. With an intuitive, web-based interface, AXE makes the process of preparing online digital editions and archives more efficient and accurate. AXE also facilitates collaboration in the digital humanities by permitting multiple scholars to work on the same document or archive at the same time from various locations, and will track all work so that variant versions can be collated and all versions can be archived. The Ajax XML encoder, with its intuitive Web-based interface, will come as a breath of fresh air to those who have previously been frustrated by text-centric tagging tools which require an expert knowledge of mark-up languages.</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Doug Reside Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"The MITHological AXE","talk_subtitle":"Multimedia Metadata Encoding with the Ajax XML Encoder","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2008-09-09T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2008-09-09T17:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"name":"Doug Reside","affiliations":[{"title":"Assistant Director","department":"Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"person_group":null,"slug":"douglas-reside","new_id":29,"headshot":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/f84486fb33fd5787f4f4e6da4edf3ce5/3c367/EbUSnYdS8RM1vfe6UK0ejdu-6P2qoZzUe5TLtmHUu6Y.jpg","srcSet":"/static/f84486fb33fd5787f4f4e6da4edf3ce5/19e71/EbUSnYdS8RM1vfe6UK0ejdu-6P2qoZzUe5TLtmHUu6Y.jpg 128w,\n/static/f84486fb33fd5787f4f4e6da4edf3ce5/68974/EbUSnYdS8RM1vfe6UK0ejdu-6P2qoZzUe5TLtmHUu6Y.jpg 256w,\n/static/f84486fb33fd5787f4f4e6da4edf3ce5/3c367/EbUSnYdS8RM1vfe6UK0ejdu-6P2qoZzUe5TLtmHUu6Y.jpg 512w","sizes":"(min-width: 512px) 512px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/f84486fb33fd5787f4f4e6da4edf3ce5/6766a/EbUSnYdS8RM1vfe6UK0ejdu-6P2qoZzUe5TLtmHUu6Y.webp 128w,\n/static/f84486fb33fd5787f4f4e6da4edf3ce5/22bfc/EbUSnYdS8RM1vfe6UK0ejdu-6P2qoZzUe5TLtmHUu6Y.webp 256w,\n/static/f84486fb33fd5787f4f4e6da4edf3ce5/d689f/EbUSnYdS8RM1vfe6UK0ejdu-6P2qoZzUe5TLtmHUu6Y.webp 512w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 512px) 512px, 100vw"}]},"width":512,"height":512}}},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Doug Reside is the Curator of the Billy Rose Theatre Division and manages all aspects of the divisionâ€™s collections and public services.
