Please join us for these two presentations.\n<strong>\"The Early Americas Digital Archive\"</strong> by Ralph Bauer, Associate Professor of English\nThe Early Americas Digital Archive (EADA) is a collection of electronic texts and links to texts originally written in or about the Americas from 1492 to approximately 1820. It is open to the public for research and teaching purposes. It is intended as a long-term and inter-disciplinary project in progress committed to exploring the intersections between traditional humanities research and digital technologies and invites scholars from all disciplines to submit their editions of early American texts for publication.\n<strong>\"Occupied Japan, 1945-1952: Gender, Class, Race\"</strong> by Marlene Mayo, Associate Professor of History\nThe site contains nineteen themes, biographies of eighteen leading and lesser known women, numerous images, and a wide range of texts ranging from fiction and poetry to oral histories and official documents.
