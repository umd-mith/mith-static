Please join us for these two presentations.\n<strong>\"Yintong: the Chinese Phonological Database\"</strong> by David Prager Branner, <em>Associate Professor of Chinese</em>\nYintong is a database of Chinese historical phonology with a number of new search mechanisms. It is designed to make this arcane but important body of knowledge accessible to students and other non-specialists who can use it in the study of modern Chinese dialects, classical literature, and historical linguistics.\n<strong>\"The Steinschneider Bibliographical Database: Digitizing a Classic Reference Work for Arabic and Latin Premodern Philosophy, Science, Medicine, and Literature Translated into Hebrew\"</strong> by Chip Manekin, <em>Associate Professor of Philosophy</em>\nIn 1893 the Austrian Jewish scholar Moritz Steinschneider published the crowning achievement of a long and distinguished scholarly career — a thousand page bibliographical essay (in German) entitled The Hebrew Translations of the Middle Ages, and the Jews as Transmitters. For over a century, the Hebrew Translations of the Middle Ages has been the primary reference source for medieval Jewish philosophy, science, medicine, and literature, translated from the Arabic and Latin into Hebrew. It is the classic work on the translation movement of the High Middle Ages from Arabic and Latin into Hebrew. Over a century old, it has never been translated, revised, or updated. The Steinschneider Bibliographical Database (SBD), a project of MITH and funded in part by an NEH collaborative grant, will be a fully searchable English translation, revision, and update of Steinschneider’s work prepared by scholars in Germany, Israel, and the US that will be available to scholars on the world wide web. As part of the website scholars will be able to consult digital images of Steinschneider’s own annotated copy of the original German, as well the fifteen-hundred page handwritten French memoire that preceded the German print edition.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"David Prager Branner, Chip Manekin Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Fellows Presentations","talk_subtitle":"David Prager Branner and Chip Manekin","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2006-04-25T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2006-04-25T17:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"David Prager Branner","slug":"david-prager-branner","new_id":128,"group_type":["Past","External"],"affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"david-prager-branner","slug":"david-prager-branner"}}],"department":null,"institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Associate Professor of Chinese"}}]}},{"data":{"name":"Chip Manekin","slug":"charles-manekin","new_id":138,"group_type":["Past","External"],"affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"charles-manekin","slug":"charles-manekin"}}],"department":null,"institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Associate Professor of Philosophy"}}]}}],"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"david-prager-branner","slug":"david-prager-branner"}}],"department":null,"institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Associate Professor of Chinese"}},{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"charles-manekin","slug":"charles-manekin"}}],"department":null,"institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Associate Professor of Philosophy"}}],"linked_participant_affiliations":null,"linked_participants":null,"linked_links":null,"linked_research_item":[{"data":{"id":"mith-digital-dialogues","title":"Digital Dialogues","image":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/e34e2/header_digital-dialogues..png","srcSet":"/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/d61d9/header_digital-dialogues..png 350w,\n/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/40d29/header_digital-dialogues..png 700w,\n/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/e34e2/header_digital-dialogues..png 1400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/b6bd0/header_digital-dialogues..webp 350w,\n/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/c73ac/header_digital-dialogues..webp 700w,\n/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/b9745/header_digital-dialogues..webp 1400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":400}}}]}}},{"data":{"id":"steinschneider-bibliographic-database","title":"Steinschneider Bibliographic Database","image":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#986828","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/521809729228df47b8803119f66f05c3/e6dd2/header_steinschneider..jpg","srcSet":"/static/521809729228df47b8803119f66f05c3/99e21/header_steinschneider..jpg 350w,\n/static/521809729228df47b8803119f66f05c3/b75af/header_steinschneider..jpg 700w,\n/static/521809729228df47b8803119f66f05c3/e6dd2/header_steinschneider..jpg 1400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/521809729228df47b8803119f66f05c3/99c58/header_steinschneider..webp 350w,\n/static/521809729228df47b8803119f66f05c3/29a2a/header_steinschneider..webp 700w,\n/static/521809729228df47b8803119f66f05c3/074c8/header_steinschneider..webp 1400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":220}}}]}}}],"linked_posts":[{"data":{"author":"digital-dialogues","author_name":"Digital Dialogues","post_date":"April 19, 2006","slug":"april-25th-digital-dialogue-david-prager-branner-and-chip-manekin","record_id":"recjbKrKN97BVDdpt","post_title":"4/25 Digital Dialogue: David Prager Branner and Chip Manekin"}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
