It was a national bestseller, and met with wide acclaim from <em>The New York Times</em>, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, <em>The Boston Globe</em>, <em>Salon</em>, <em>The Guardian</em>, <em>The Economist, The Independent, Kirkus Reviews, Bookforum, Scientific American, New Scientist, Brain Pickings, Ars Technica, Science News</em> and many others. Blum discussed <em>Tubes</em> with Terry Gross on NPR's <em>Fresh Air</em>; BBC 4 presented it as a \"Book of the Week\"; and Blum spoke about his research on the stages of TED Global and the London School of Economics, among dozens of other venues.
