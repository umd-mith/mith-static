Kindle, Nook, iPhone . . . after 2000 years, the codex is getting an upgrade. But what kind of electronic books and electronic reading devices do we really want? Are we trying to improve on the book, or create something new? Something different? Are there some universal design principles we can agree on? And what about the bigger picture: can electronic gadgetry reverse the national decline in reading dramatically documented by agencies such as the NEA? This roundtable discussion led by Ben Bederson, Nick Chen, and Matt Kirschenbaum will feature as many electronic reading and electronic book devices as we can lay our hands on, including some prototypes being developed here at the University of Maryland. We'll hold them up, pass them around, turn them on, talk some trash, and, in the process, maybe gain just a little bit of insight into what we all want from our electronic book readers. Attendees are encouraged to bring along electronic book devices of their own.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Ben Bederson, Nick Chen, Matthew Kirschenbaum Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"The Great Ebook Throwdown","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2009-11-03T17:30:00.000Z","end":"2009-11-03T18:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Ben Bederson","slug":"ben-bederson","new_id":389,"group_type":["External"],"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a7bdd157693ea0103c91f4e8c5b04b94/079bf/bederson..jpg","srcSet":"/static/a7bdd157693ea0103c91f4e8c5b04b94/4d18c/bederson..jpg 55w,\n/static/a7bdd157693ea0103c91f4e8c5b04b94/28ae9/bederson..jpg 110w,\n/static/a7bdd157693ea0103c91f4e8c5b04b94/079bf/bederson..jpg 220w","sizes":"(min-width: 220px) 220px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/a7bdd157693ea0103c91f4e8c5b04b94/07dd4/bederson..webp 55w,\n/static/a7bdd157693ea0103c91f4e8c5b04b94/6dbad/bederson..webp 110w,\n/static/a7bdd157693ea0103c91f4e8c5b04b94/45999/bederson..webp 220w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 220px) 220px, 100vw"}]},"width":220,"height":273}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p><strong>Benjamin B.
