As a result, language and national borders emerge in the communication landscape online. What can we do to make those borders more porous? Expatriates, migrants, minorities, diasporic communities, and language learners play an important role in forming transnational networks, by creating social ties across nations and communities. A closer look to their connections and interactions online might illuminate us in many ways, i.e. how to increase intercultural awareness, information diffusion across language borders, and promote international relations, outreach or activism at a global scale. Focusing on the personal social network of multilingual Twitter users, I will discuss how social network analysis unveils the intersections of language groups. In general, the use of social network analysis to discover patterns of intercultural connections constitutes an enriching approach that can be applied in many disciplines. Also, I will talk about the influence of the social network on the language choices of multilingual users, with particular attention to the use of English as a Lingua Franca. Finally, I will invite the audience to reflect on what prevents or encourages translation behaviors and cross-cultural awareness in the social media context.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Irene Eleta Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Multilingual Users of Twitter","talk_subtitle":"Social Ties Across Language Borders or How a Story Could Travel the World","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2013-04-23T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2013-04-23T17:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Irene  Eleta","slug":"irene-eleta","new_id":442,"group_type":["External"],"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#688858","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/e603694b271f02432cef5573233c541e/1965e/MogollonIrene..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/e603694b271f02432cef5573233c541e/11bd5/MogollonIrene..jpg 75w,\n/mith-static/static/e603694b271f02432cef5573233c541e/5c866/MogollonIrene..jpg 150w,\n/mith-static/static/e603694b271f02432cef5573233c541e/1965e/MogollonIrene..jpg 300w","sizes":"(min-width: 300px) 300px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/e603694b271f02432cef5573233c541e/1db0c/MogollonIrene..webp 75w,\n/mith-static/static/e603694b271f02432cef5573233c541e/5a49f/MogollonIrene..webp 150w,\n/mith-static/static/e603694b271f02432cef5573233c541e/93bf1/MogollonIrene..webp 300w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 300px) 300px, 100vw"}]},"width":300,"height":420}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"irene-eleta","slug":"irene-eleta"}}],"department":"College of Information Studies","institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Doctoral Candidate"}}]}}],"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"irene-eleta","slug":"irene-eleta"}}],"department":"College of Information Studies","institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Doctoral Candidate"}}],"linked_participant_affiliations":null,"linked_participants":null,"linked_links":null,"linked_research_item":[{"data":{"id":"mith-digital-dialogues","title":"Digital Dialogues","image":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/e34e2/header_digital-dialogues..png","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/d61d9/header_digital-dialogues..png 350w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/40d29/header_digital-dialogues..png 700w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/e34e2/header_digital-dialogues..png 1400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/b6bd0/header_digital-dialogues..webp 350w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/c73ac/header_digital-dialogues..webp 700w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/b9745/header_digital-dialogues..webp 1400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":400}}}]}}}],"linked_posts":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["196133661","2857345991"],"slicesMap":{}}
