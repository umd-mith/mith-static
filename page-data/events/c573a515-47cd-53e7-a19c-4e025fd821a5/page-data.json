Her groundbreaking explorations across the arts, humanities, and sciences represent a novel use of methods and tools that bind research with introspective cultural production. As an artist, her work ranges from game-inspired systems to computer viruses, embodied interfaces to interactive texts; these works are exhibited internationally. As a scholar interested in how human values are in play across technologies and systems, Flanagan has written more than 20 critical essays and chapters on games, empathy, gender and digital representation, art and technology, and responsible design. Her three books in English include the recent <em>Critical Play</em> (2009) with MIT Press. Flanagan founded the <a href=\"http://www.tiltfactor.org\">Tiltfactor</a> game research laboratory in 2003, where researchers study and make social games, urban games, and software in a rigorous theory/practice environment. She is the Sherman Fairchild Distinguished Professor in Digital Humanities at Dartmouth College.</p>"}}}],"participants":[],"links":[],"sponsors":[],"partners":[],"research":[{"id":"mith-digital-dialogues","title":"Digital Dialogues","image":[{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v2/22/22/1700092800000/ETgCHh10ipX-pfzAuL2a4w/c8Tb8qufApHPOoBYJtOFNFEuDv0mxiMC1DE7SeZkc_cnJZgGC_0yxRLBD3j0UoZYrDrTGxgyqBSjm4GUnamoLsF1hxVgerbxsPqxPF2uyaaafkhnlfJ4WjGOSfqUull7B8A_5R4G-b_UpaFiYcRQ4Vjg2T_a_1OeQuL3RfMaOok/jtADp_yL0i2CPgtArFiIFY-RAksb1F3VrXBqJBCK9gM"}]}],"posts":[{"post_title":"3/8 MITH Digital Dialogue: Mary Flanagan, \"Playworlds: rule systems & relational art\"","author":"digital-dialogues","author_name":"Digital Dialogues","post_date":"March 2, 2011","slug":"38-mith-digital-dialogue-mary-flanagan-playworlds-rule-systems"}],"disciplines":[],"methods":[]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
