Please join us for these two presentations.\n<strong>\"The Multilingual Thesaurus for Medieval Studies\"</strong> by Patricia Cossard The Multilingual Thesaurus for Medieval Studies (MLTMS) is an attempt to build both a research database and a software tool. As opposed to a traditional thesaurus, MLTMS will work as both a termbase for web-based search and retrieval as well as a research database for the deconstruction of historical hierarchical ontologies as expressed by contributing classification systems. MLTMS is intended as a long-term and inter-disciplinary project focused on the European Middle Ages. Currently in its infancy, the software will ultimately researchers to do web-based search and retrieval of both primary evidence (in corpora) and argument (in journals and books). The technology will be open source.\n<strong>\"Creating Digital Versions of Early 20th Century African-American Texts: Nannie Burroughs' 1928 'What the Negro Wants Politically.'\"</strong> by Michele Mason The Washington Post called the 1928 presidential election, \"the bitterest and most baffling presidential campaign of more than a generation.\" During the campaign, civil rights leader Nannie Burroughs campaigned tirelessly for the Republican party. As a spokesperson for the Republican National Committee, Burroughs issued statements through the press and delivered dozens of speeches on behalf of Herbert Hoover. When the election was over Burroughs wrote \"What the Negro Wants Politically,\" offering a brief analysis of the racial dimensions of the election and issuing a set of political demands to the Republican party. Published in several African-American newspapers, Burroughs' article reached a large national audience. In this presentation I will discuss the significance of Burroughs' editorial, along with the advantages a digital version of the text offers.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Patti Cossard, Michele Mason Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Fellows Presentations","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2006-04-11T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2006-04-11T17:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Patricia  Cossard","slug":"patricia-cossard","new_id":131,"group_type":["Past","External"],"affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"patricia-cossard","slug":"patricia-cossard"}}],"department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Resident Fellow (UMD Libraries)"}}]}},{"data":{"name":"Michele  Mason","slug":"michele-mason","new_id":139,"group_type":["Past","External"],"affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"michele-mason","slug":"michele-mason"}}],"department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Winnemore Digital Humanities Dissertation Fellow"}}]}}],"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"patricia-cossard","slug":"patricia-cossard"}}],"department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Resident Fellow (UMD Libraries)"}},{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"michele-mason","slug":"michele-mason"}}],"department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Winnemore Digital Humanities Dissertation Fellow"}}],"linked_participant_affiliations":null,"linked_participants":null,"linked_links":null,"linked_research_item":[{"data":{"id":"mith-digital-dialogues","title":"Digital Dialogues","image":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/e34e2/header_digital-dialogues..png","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/d61d9/header_digital-dialogues..png 350w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/40d29/header_digital-dialogues..png 700w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/e34e2/header_digital-dialogues..png 1400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/b6bd0/header_digital-dialogues..webp 350w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/c73ac/header_digital-dialogues..webp 700w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/b9745/header_digital-dialogues..webp 1400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":400}}}]}}}],"linked_posts":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["196133661","2857345991"],"slicesMap":{}}
