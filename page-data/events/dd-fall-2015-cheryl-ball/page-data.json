Vega will be a free, editorial-management platform that supports peer review, copy-editing, and publication of multimedia-rich and data-driven scholarship and creative works in all areas of research. With the support of an Andrew W. Mellon Foundation grant, Vega is being designed with a unique editorial workflow that recognizes and values the importance of screen-based multimedia research, including digital humanities projects and electronic literature. What many journals and presses that publish this kind of work lack is an editorial management system that will move a piece of scholarly multimedia through the submission, review, and production processes as a single, scholarly entity. I will discuss the platform, its authorial and editorial features, and welcome questions and comments from an audience of potential users of Vega, which is only part-way through its first year of a three-year development cycle.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Cheryl Ball Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"The Archipelago of Multimedia Publishing","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2015-10-13T16:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Cheryl  Ball","slug":"cheryl-ball","new_id":401,"group_type":["External"],"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#b8b8b8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/444fc56c2c364112de1185426ccaba28/9fd8f/Cheryl_Ball..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/444fc56c2c364112de1185426ccaba28/790fb/Cheryl_Ball..jpg 70w,\n/mith-static/static/444fc56c2c364112de1185426ccaba28/00626/Cheryl_Ball..jpg 140w,\n/mith-static/static/444fc56c2c364112de1185426ccaba28/9fd8f/Cheryl_Ball..jpg 280w","sizes":"(min-width: 280px) 280px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/444fc56c2c364112de1185426ccaba28/7f19d/Cheryl_Ball..webp 70w,\n/mith-static/static/444fc56c2c364112de1185426ccaba28/35ad7/Cheryl_Ball..webp 140w,\n/mith-static/static/444fc56c2c364112de1185426ccaba28/4c653/Cheryl_Ball..webp 280w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 280px) 280px, 100vw"}]},"width":280,"height":299}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"cheryl-ball","slug":"cheryl-ball"}}],"department":null,"institution":"West Virginia University","title":"Associate Professor of Digital Publishing"}}]}}],"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"cheryl-ball","slug":"cheryl-ball"}}],"department":null,"institution":"West Virginia University","title":"Associate Professor of Digital Publishing"}}],"linked_participant_affiliations":null,"linked_participants":null,"linked_links":[{"data":{"title":"DD Presentation PDF","url":"https://archive.mith.umd.edu/mith-2020/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CherylBall-DD-Pres-20151013-red.pdf","type":"attachment"}},{"data":{"title":"View Storify","url":"https://storify.com/digdialog/cheryl-ball-digital-dialogue-at-mith-october-13-20","type":"file_link"}}],"linked_research_item":[{"data":{"id":"mith-digital-dialogues","title":"Digital Dialogues","image":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/e34e2/header_digital-dialogues..png","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/d61d9/header_digital-dialogues..png 350w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/40d29/header_digital-dialogues..png 700w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/e34e2/header_digital-dialogues..png 1400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/b6bd0/header_digital-dialogues..webp 350w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/c73ac/header_digital-dialogues..webp 700w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/b9745/header_digital-dialogues..webp 1400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":400}}}]}}}],"linked_posts":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
