However, designing authoring tools that effectively integrate the discrete media-capture components of mobile devices to enable rich expression remains a challenge. This presentation will provide a brief overview of collaborative technologies that support children's storytelling, with a focus on mobile applications. It will detail a 4-month study on the observed use of StoryKit, a mobile interface that integrates multimodal media-capture tools to support the creation of multimedia stories on an iPhone/iPod Touch. The primary objectives of the study were to explore the ways in which applications like StoryKit enable families to create and share stories; and to investigate how the created stories themselves might inform the design of, and learning potential for mobile storytelling applications. Its results suggest that StoryKit's relatively simple but well-integrated interface enables the creation of vibrant, varied narratives. Further, its portability supported the complementary co-construction and spontaneous, playful capture of stories by children and their trusted adults.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Beth Bonsignore Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"The Design and Use of StoryKit","talk_subtitle":"An Intergenerational Mobile Storytelling App ","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2010-03-23T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2010-03-23T17:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Beth  Bonsignore","slug":"beth-bonsignore","new_id":56,"group_type":["Past","External"],"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#282838","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/cedd411fa334e391d6f411137442e131/c81f4/Elizabeth-Bonsignore-e1470687871906..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/cedd411fa334e391d6f411137442e131/31a06/Elizabeth-Bonsignore-e1470687871906..jpg 119w,\n/mith-static/static/cedd411fa334e391d6f411137442e131/e9125/Elizabeth-Bonsignore-e1470687871906..jpg 238w,\n/mith-static/static/cedd411fa334e391d6f411137442e131/c81f4/Elizabeth-Bonsignore-e1470687871906..jpg 476w","sizes":"(min-width: 476px) 476px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/cedd411fa334e391d6f411137442e131/730b1/Elizabeth-Bonsignore-e1470687871906..webp 119w,\n/mith-static/static/cedd411fa334e391d6f411137442e131/e745e/Elizabeth-Bonsignore-e1470687871906..webp 238w,\n/mith-static/static/cedd411fa334e391d6f411137442e131/789c3/Elizabeth-Bonsignore-e1470687871906..webp 476w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 476px) 476px, 100vw"}]},"width":476,"height":502}}}]},"affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"beth-bonsignore","slug":"beth-bonsignore"}}],"department":"College of Information Studies","institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Doctoral Candidate"}}]}}],"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"beth-bonsignore","slug":"beth-bonsignore"}}],"department":"College of Information Studies","institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Doctoral Candidate"}},{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"beth-bonsignore","slug":"beth-bonsignore"}}],"department":"College of Information Studies","institution":"University of Maryland","title":"PhD Candidate"}}],"linked_participant_affiliations":null,"linked_participants":null,"linked_links":null,"linked_research_item":[{"data":{"id":"mith-digital-dialogues","title":"Digital Dialogues","image":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/e34e2/header_digital-dialogues..png","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/d61d9/header_digital-dialogues..png 350w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/40d29/header_digital-dialogues..png 700w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/e34e2/header_digital-dialogues..png 1400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/b6bd0/header_digital-dialogues..webp 350w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/c73ac/header_digital-dialogues..webp 700w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/b9745/header_digital-dialogues..webp 1400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":400}}}]}}}],"linked_posts":[{"data":{"author":"digital-dialogues","author_name":"Digital Dialogues","post_date":"March 17, 2010","slug":"march-23-digital-dialogue-beth-bonsignore-the-design-and-use-of-storykit-an-intergenerational-mobile-storytelling-app","record_id":"reckf5r0qoSM6VqRZ","post_title":"3/23 MITH Digital Dialogue: Beth Bonsignore, \"The Design and Use of StoryKit: An Intergenerational Mobile Storytelling App\""}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
