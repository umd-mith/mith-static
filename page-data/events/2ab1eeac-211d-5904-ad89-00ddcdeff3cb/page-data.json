They are closed to integration with other administrative, scholarly, and social networking systems on the web. These systems lack the ability to develop identities in relation to various systems, texts, and institutions. As new systems such as Zotero (GMU) and Digital Notebook (Georgetown) are being developed to take advantage of Web 2.0 capabilities such as citing, tagging, and cross referencing content across systems, the issue of identity is still in flux. On the one hand, Gregory Ulmer's work provides the theoretical grounds and pedagogical model for seeing identity formation as the basis of research. On the other hand, Hardt and Negri recognize that the modernist institutions that produce identities are breaking down. The newer CMS systems are centered on the production of a university or scholarly identity. This paper will examine the possibility of accepting the personal and subcultural identities that will inevitably emerge with the development of Web 2.0 research tools.</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Byron Hawk Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Identifying Web 2.0: Remixing Institutional Identities","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2007-03-27T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2007-03-27T17:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"name":"Byron Hawk","affiliations":[{"title":"Associate Professor of English","department":null,"institution":"George Mason University"}],"person_group":null,"slug":"byron-hawk","new_id":398,"headshot":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#c8c8c8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3951f74f7c502b341aad4a9918c8e079/dd515/wpxpIfy6IAcpu9M7-6yfLU9toMNd6I1ARWoBzkCJAfg.jpg","srcSet":"/static/3951f74f7c502b341aad4a9918c8e079/6ac16/wpxpIfy6IAcpu9M7-6yfLU9toMNd6I1ARWoBzkCJAfg.jpg 50w,\n/static/3951f74f7c502b341aad4a9918c8e079/e07e1/wpxpIfy6IAcpu9M7-6yfLU9toMNd6I1ARWoBzkCJAfg.jpg 100w,\n/static/3951f74f7c502b341aad4a9918c8e079/dd515/wpxpIfy6IAcpu9M7-6yfLU9toMNd6I1ARWoBzkCJAfg.jpg 200w","sizes":"(min-width: 200px) 200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/3951f74f7c502b341aad4a9918c8e079/dbc4a/wpxpIfy6IAcpu9M7-6yfLU9toMNd6I1ARWoBzkCJAfg.webp 50w,\n/static/3951f74f7c502b341aad4a9918c8e079/d8057/wpxpIfy6IAcpu9M7-6yfLU9toMNd6I1ARWoBzkCJAfg.webp 100w,\n/static/3951f74f7c502b341aad4a9918c8e079/2e34e/wpxpIfy6IAcpu9M7-6yfLU9toMNd6I1ARWoBzkCJAfg.webp 200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 200px) 200px, 100vw"}]},"width":200,"height":200}}},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Byron Hawk is an Associate Professor of English at George Mason University.
