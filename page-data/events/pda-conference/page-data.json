He is on the Board of Directors of the BEAM Foundation.In 1995, he was the first music producer to be accepted into the National Recording Academy based on his work in games rather than in CD’s, film, or movies. He worked toward the goal of establishing a Grammy category for games, first alone, then years later in the group led by Chance Thomas that achieved this goal.</p>"}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"george-sanger","slug":"george-sanger"}}],"department":null,"institution":null,"title":"Musician"}}]}},{"data":{"name":"Sally  Bedell Smith","slug":"sally-bedell-smith","new_id":603,"group_type":["External"],"affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"sally-bedell-smith","slug":"sally-bedell-smith"}}],"department":null,"institution":null,"title":"Author"}}]}}],"sponsors":null,"partners":[{"data":{"name":"University of Maryland Libraries","website":"lib.umd.edu","type":"Internal","slug":"umdlib"}},{"data":{"name":"Library of Congress","website":"loc.gov","type":"External","slug":"loc"}}],"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"george-sanger","slug":"george-sanger"}}],"department":null,"institution":null,"title":"Musician"}},{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"sally-bedell-smith","slug":"sally-bedell-smith"}}],"department":null,"institution":null,"title":"Author"}}],"linked_participant_affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"trevor-munoz"}}],"end":2017,"institution":"University of Maryland","department":"Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities","start":2012,"title":"Associate Director","person_group":["current"]}},{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"bill-lefurgy"}}],"end":null,"institution":"Library of Congress","department":"National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program","start":null,"title":"Digital Initiatives Manager","person_group":null}}],"linked_participants":[{"data":{"id":"trevor-munoz"}},{"data":{"id":"bill-lefurgy"}}],"linked_links":[{"data":{"title":"Event Website","url":"http://mith.umd.edu/pda2013/","type":"url"}}],"linked_research_item":[{"data":{"id":"pda-2013","title":"Personal Digital Archiving 2013","image":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/e61d810847c41ff378b766f6f0e201e7/e34e2/header_pda2013..png","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/e61d810847c41ff378b766f6f0e201e7/d61d9/header_pda2013..png 350w,\n/mith-static/static/e61d810847c41ff378b766f6f0e201e7/40d29/header_pda2013..png 700w,\n/mith-static/static/e61d810847c41ff378b766f6f0e201e7/e34e2/header_pda2013..png 1400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/e61d810847c41ff378b766f6f0e201e7/b6bd0/header_pda2013..webp 350w,\n/mith-static/static/e61d810847c41ff378b766f6f0e201e7/c73ac/header_pda2013..webp 700w,\n/mith-static/static/e61d810847c41ff378b766f6f0e201e7/b9745/header_pda2013..webp 1400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":400}}}]}}}],"linked_posts":[{"data":{"author":"trevor-munoz","author_name":"Trevor Muñoz","post_date":"August 7, 2012","slug":"announcing-the-personal-digital-archiving-2013-conference","record_id":"rec0Kd6PIiuih8pYQ","post_title":"Announcing the Personal Digital Archiving 2013 Conference"}}],"participants":[{"data":{"id":"trevor-munoz"},"affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"trevor-munoz"}}],"end":2017,"institution":"University of Maryland","department":"Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities","start":2012,"title":"Associate Director","person_group":["current"]}}]},{"data":{"id":"bill-lefurgy"},"affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"bill-lefurgy"}}],"end":null,"institution":"Library of Congress","department":"National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program","start":null,"title":"Digital Initiatives Manager","person_group":null}}]}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["196133661","2857345991"],"slicesMap":{}}
