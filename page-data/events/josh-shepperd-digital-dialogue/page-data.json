Taking an institutional approach, this presentation looks at the infrastructural origins of public media in archival distribution practices after WWII.\nIn 1948 educational broadcasters were already 27 years into the first national media advocacy to create a system of universal access to public education. Due to inconsistent broadcast practices and lack of a profit model, advocates began to aggregate key quality programming from university stations at the University of Illinois under the moniker the National Association of Educational Broadcasters.\nThe result was the creation of a decentralized “Bicycle Network” built around archival management and distribution. The proto-metadata descriptions developed by the NAEB had the result of both coding and consolidating the characteristics of genres now associated with public broadcasting and cable television. In addition, quantitative audience research into the pedagogical effectiveness of each new genre led to the construction of the first academic Communication departments, beginning in 1948.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Josh Shepperd Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Public Media's Origin as a Strategically Networked Archive, 1949-1953","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2017-04-11T16:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Josh Shepperd","slug":"josh-shepperd","new_id":286,"group_type":["External"],"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/10bad789cb4b7429d40ba8fc95a5a904/845e4/Josh-Shepperd-photo..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/10bad789cb4b7429d40ba8fc95a5a904/43773/Josh-Shepperd-photo..jpg 48w,\n/mith-static/static/10bad789cb4b7429d40ba8fc95a5a904/f18e1/Josh-Shepperd-photo..jpg 96w,\n/mith-static/static/10bad789cb4b7429d40ba8fc95a5a904/845e4/Josh-Shepperd-photo..jpg 192w","sizes":"(min-width: 192px) 192px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/10bad789cb4b7429d40ba8fc95a5a904/e78b1/Josh-Shepperd-photo..webp 48w,\n/mith-static/static/10bad789cb4b7429d40ba8fc95a5a904/8ef24/Josh-Shepperd-photo..webp 96w,\n/mith-static/static/10bad789cb4b7429d40ba8fc95a5a904/694c3/Josh-Shepperd-photo..webp 192w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 192px) 192px, 100vw"}]},"width":192,"height":192}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"josh-shepperd","slug":"josh-shepperd"}}],"department":null,"institution":"Catholic University","title":"Assistant Professor"}}]}}],"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"josh-shepperd","slug":"josh-shepperd"}}],"department":null,"institution":"Catholic University","title":"Assistant Professor"}}],"linked_participant_affiliations":null,"linked_participants":null,"linked_links":[{"data":{"title":"Shepperd Presentation Slides","url":"https://archive.mith.umd.edu/mith-2020/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/UMD_Presentation_2017_1-1.pdf","type":"attachment"}},{"data":{"title":"Storify Recap","url":"https://storify.com/digdialog/josh-shepperd-digital-dialogue-april-11-2017","type":"file_link"}}],"linked_research_item":[{"data":{"id":"mith-digital-dialogues","title":"Digital Dialogues","image":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/e34e2/header_digital-dialogues..png","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/d61d9/header_digital-dialogues..png 350w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/40d29/header_digital-dialogues..png 700w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/e34e2/header_digital-dialogues..png 1400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/b6bd0/header_digital-dialogues..webp 350w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/c73ac/header_digital-dialogues..webp 700w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/b9745/header_digital-dialogues..webp 1400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":400}}}]}}}],"linked_posts":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
