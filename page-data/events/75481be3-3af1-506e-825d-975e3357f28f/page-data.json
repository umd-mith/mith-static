Although Roxie's World is a blog written by an academic, it is not an \"academic blog\" in the usual sense. It is a creative experiment in punditry, topical humor, and cultural commentary offered in the voice of a 13-year-old wire-haired fox terrier—Roxie—who has a leaky heart and a laptop. Roxie's major preoccupations are politics, pop culture, and basketball. Her stance is that of a dogged progressive fascinated by the queer doings of Homo sapiens. Though Roxie is a purebred, Lindemann's lecture is a mongrel mixture of critical reflection on her own practices as a blogger and analysis of what blogging can teach us about reading, writing, and social networking in the twenty-first century. Situated at the intersection of canine cultural studies, queer/feminist studies, and an emerging discourse of blog studies, the presentation takes up issues of persona, parody, and irony in connection with a post-9/11 politics of dissent; of building and tracking real and imagined audiences in the blogosphere; of the complex role played by words, images, and sound in the grammar and in the world-making aspirations of blogs; and of satirical self-publication as a healthy response to the conditions of academic work under late capitalism.</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Marilee Lindemann Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"On the Internet, Everybody Thinks I'm a Dog","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2008-02-05T17:30:00.000Z","end":"2008-02-05T18:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"name":"Marilee Lindemann","affiliations":[{"title":null,"department":"English Department, LGBT Studies Program","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"person_group":null,"slug":"marilee-lindemann","new_id":305,"headshot":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#081808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/234dae81454295236fc45b1b2cd5dfbf/71692/OQ-zwIO0_b3Xyz9D3NOxzOfcu9q0tOeq84TQGyxrSEo.jpg","srcSet":"/static/234dae81454295236fc45b1b2cd5dfbf/dd515/OQ-zwIO0_b3Xyz9D3NOxzOfcu9q0tOeq84TQGyxrSEo.jpg 200w,\n/static/234dae81454295236fc45b1b2cd5dfbf/4edb7/OQ-zwIO0_b3Xyz9D3NOxzOfcu9q0tOeq84TQGyxrSEo.jpg 400w,\n/static/234dae81454295236fc45b1b2cd5dfbf/71692/OQ-zwIO0_b3Xyz9D3NOxzOfcu9q0tOeq84TQGyxrSEo.jpg 799w","sizes":"(min-width: 799px) 799px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/234dae81454295236fc45b1b2cd5dfbf/2e34e/OQ-zwIO0_b3Xyz9D3NOxzOfcu9q0tOeq84TQGyxrSEo.webp 200w,\n/static/234dae81454295236fc45b1b2cd5dfbf/17f53/OQ-zwIO0_b3Xyz9D3NOxzOfcu9q0tOeq84TQGyxrSEo.webp 400w,\n/static/234dae81454295236fc45b1b2cd5dfbf/7c998/OQ-zwIO0_b3Xyz9D3NOxzOfcu9q0tOeq84TQGyxrSEo.webp 799w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 799px) 799px, 100vw"}]},"width":799,"height":798}}},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>MARILEE LINDEMANN is an Associate Professor in the Department of English and the Director of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Studies Program at the University of Maryland.
