In this talk, I will engage in some general musings about the nature of that amorphous mass we call a “project,” but I will also relate the particular history of and deliver some specific data concerning the THATCamp project. A sneak preview: since its start in 2008, THATCamp, The Humanities and Technology Camp, has seen more than 170 events held or planned worldwide and has provided digital training and professional development to more than 6000 people, most of them humanities scholars, students, or professionals. Whether we consider it one project or many, THATCamp has become an essential feature of the digital humanities landscape, and it is time for some perspective on it.\n<strong>10:45 – 11:00 am</strong>\nBreak\n<strong>11:00 am</strong>\nProject Discussions begin\n<small>This event is not sponsored by, or offered on behalf of, the U.S. Government, the National Endowment for the Humanities, or its Office of Digital Humanities.
