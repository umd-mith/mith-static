It is crucial to reclaim the humanity of communities, such as the ones along the Mexico-U.S. border, by critically contextualizing and reshaping knowledge production through the use of digital methods and tools, as well as collaborative practices. Nevertheless, as a member of the border community, it is necessary to question and consider alternative ways to work with and without the institution- and university-based initiatives, that own, control and direct the material, structure and meaning of DH projects connected to personal representations and/or critical issues. Based on my experience, as cofounder of Borderlands Archive Cartography and team member of United Fronteras, I will discuss the importance of tracing, recompiling and documenting the cultural, literary and digital record of the binational-transnational area of the U.S.-Mexico border, in order to bring to the forefront the various ways in which historical realities, past and present socio-political conditions, and local experiences of this region are being imagined, showcased, studied and interpreted.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Sylvia Fernandez Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Behind the Line","talk_subtitle":"Digitally Rethinking and Restructuring Geopolitical Borders and its Surroundings","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2019-10-22T16:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Sylvia Fernandez","slug":"sylvia-fernandez","new_id":536,"group_type":["External"],"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#282828","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/5e9b17b767d630af5d4dfe918e7dfe3d/bbfdc/sylvia-fernandez..jpg","srcSet":"/static/5e9b17b767d630af5d4dfe918e7dfe3d/86e99/sylvia-fernandez..jpg 98w,\n/static/5e9b17b767d630af5d4dfe918e7dfe3d/4253a/sylvia-fernandez..jpg 197w,\n/static/5e9b17b767d630af5d4dfe918e7dfe3d/bbfdc/sylvia-fernandez..jpg 393w","sizes":"(min-width: 393px) 393px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/5e9b17b767d630af5d4dfe918e7dfe3d/f1ce5/sylvia-fernandez..webp 98w,\n/static/5e9b17b767d630af5d4dfe918e7dfe3d/acead/sylvia-fernandez..webp 197w,\n/static/5e9b17b767d630af5d4dfe918e7dfe3d/d987c/sylvia-fernandez..webp 393w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 393px) 393px, 100vw"}]},"width":393,"height":393}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"sylvia-fernandez","slug":"sylvia-fernandez"}}],"department":null,"institution":"University of Houston","title":"Ph.D Candidate"}}]}}],"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"sylvia-fernandez","slug":"sylvia-fernandez"}}],"department":null,"institution":"University of Houston","title":"Ph.D Candidate"}}],"linked_participant_affiliations":null,"linked_participants":null,"linked_links":null,"linked_research_item":[{"data":{"id":"mith-digital-dialogues","title":"Digital Dialogues","image":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/e34e2/header_digital-dialogues..png","srcSet":"/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/d61d9/header_digital-dialogues..png 350w,\n/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/40d29/header_digital-dialogues..png 700w,\n/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/e34e2/header_digital-dialogues..png 1400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/b6bd0/header_digital-dialogues..webp 350w,\n/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/c73ac/header_digital-dialogues..webp 700w,\n/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/b9745/header_digital-dialogues..webp 1400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":400}}}]}}}],"linked_posts":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
