We will also be inviting others who might be interested to join us.\nThe discussions that took place at both prior events allowed us to synthesize your input and stated research interests in this topic, which we used to begin planning for several ongoing MITH <a href=\"https://mith.umd.edu/research/digital-humanities-incubator/\">Digital Humanities Incubator</a> sessions that will occur throughout February 2015 as part of Black History Month, and possibly beyond. These sessions will constitute MITH’s contribution to the University of Maryland teach-ins occurring throughout campus in Spring 2015.\nIn this first session on January 27th, MITH will begin by reviewing previous discussions and outcomes and then we will discuss our plans for the following future sessions, inviting further feedback from the group</p>"}},"image":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/82e76bfb7559ac47126ee4f2b2753745/716c3/event_dhincubator-teachins..png","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/82e76bfb7559ac47126ee4f2b2753745/e1907/event_dhincubator-teachins..png 150w,\n/mith-static/static/82e76bfb7559ac47126ee4f2b2753745/0ca00/event_dhincubator-teachins..png 300w,\n/mith-static/static/82e76bfb7559ac47126ee4f2b2753745/716c3/event_dhincubator-teachins..png 600w","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/82e76bfb7559ac47126ee4f2b2753745/b41db/event_dhincubator-teachins..webp 150w,\n/mith-static/static/82e76bfb7559ac47126ee4f2b2753745/9d5e2/event_dhincubator-teachins..webp 300w,\n/mith-static/static/82e76bfb7559ac47126ee4f2b2753745/9a4d4/event_dhincubator-teachins..webp 600w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":700}}}]},"event_title":"Session I: Previewing MITH’s Teach Ins for #BlackLivesMatter at #UMD","talk_title":"Previewing MITH’s Teach Ins for #BlackLivesMatter at #UMD","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Workshop"],"start":"2015-01-27T17:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":null,"speakers":null,"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":[{"data":{"term":"African and African American Studies","type":"Discipline"}}],"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":null,"linked_participant_affiliations":null,"linked_participants":null,"linked_links":null,"linked_research_item":[{"data":{"id":"digital-humanities-incubator-2014-15-researching-ferguson","title":"Digital Humanities Incubator 2014–15","image":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/eb93aa3692938cb873e8485ff24d0bf1/f576d/header_dhincubator-researching-ferguson..png","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/eb93aa3692938cb873e8485ff24d0bf1/8cd92/header_dhincubator-researching-ferguson..png 350w,\n/mith-static/static/eb93aa3692938cb873e8485ff24d0bf1/b3bdc/header_dhincubator-researching-ferguson..png 700w,\n/mith-static/static/eb93aa3692938cb873e8485ff24d0bf1/f576d/header_dhincubator-researching-ferguson..png 1400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/eb93aa3692938cb873e8485ff24d0bf1/62fb1/header_dhincubator-researching-ferguson..webp 350w,\n/mith-static/static/eb93aa3692938cb873e8485ff24d0bf1/8b68f/header_dhincubator-researching-ferguson..webp 700w,\n/mith-static/static/eb93aa3692938cb873e8485ff24d0bf1/ee218/header_dhincubator-researching-ferguson..webp 1400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":358}}}]}}}],"linked_posts":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["196133661","2857345991"],"slicesMap":{}}
