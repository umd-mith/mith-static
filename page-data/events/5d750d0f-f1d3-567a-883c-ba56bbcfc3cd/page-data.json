Political events such as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring\">Arab Spring</a> and social movements like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter\">Black Lives Matter</a> show what important work is possible with social media at scale.\nAt the same time social media can be used to spread messages of intolerance, harassment and hate, as we've seen in the rhetoric surrounding <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamergate_controversy\">Gamergate</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2016/hate-race\">2016 presidential race</a>. Women, members of ethnic minorities, and activists often find themselves the target of trolls and organized groups that attempt to shut down and silence their work.\nPlease join us at MITH (and remotely) to gather with others looking to learn from each other about how to investigate and thwart hate speech in social media. The Southern Poverty Law Center's <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files\">Extremist Files</a> provides a list of known hate groups. At our Night Against Hate event we will collaboratively try to link the SPLC list to social media accounts. This list can then be used by researchers here at UMD and elsewhere to examine the effect that these groups are having online. In addition, we hope to use this event to learn from each other about emerging tools and techniques of self care while working online.\nIf you're planning to attend in person or remotely, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf_eIHiYZiDqwmxLebU1VDwh5U381cTLFP0jOJd7ijJ0ufLrw/viewform\">please click here to sign up.</a> Pizza will be provided for those that can make it to MITH.</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Night Against Hate","talk_title":null,"talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Other Event"],"start":"2016-10-13T23:00:00.000Z","end":"2016-10-14T01:00:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room, 301 Hornbake Library","speakers":[],"participants":[{"name":"Neil Fraistat","title":"Director","department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland","start":2006,"end":2017,"person_group":null,"slug":"neil-fraistat","new_id":22},{"name":"Ed Summers","title":"Research Faculty","department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland","start":2014,"end":2021,"person_group":null,"slug":"ed-summers","new_id":8},{"name":"Purdom Lindblad","title":"Assistant Director for Innovation and Learning","department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland","start":null,"end":null,"person_group":["current"],"slug":"purdom-lindblad","new_id":3},{"name":"Stephanie Sapienza","title":"Project Manager","department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland","start":2013,"end":2018,"person_group":["current"],"slug":"stephanie-sapienza","new_id":7}],"links":[],"sponsors":[],"partners":[],"research":[{"id":"night-against-hate","title":"Night Against Hate","image":null}],"posts":[{"post_title":"A Block List Against Hate","author":"ed-summers","author_name":"Ed Summers","post_date":"October 27, 2016","slug":"block-list-hate"},{"post_title":"Come join MITH Thursday 10/13 for a Night Against Hate!","author":"mith","author_name":"MITH ","post_date":"October 11, 2016","slug":"come-join-mith-thursday-1013-night-hate"}],"disciplines":[],"methods":[]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
