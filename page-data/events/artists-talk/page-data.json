The conceptual focus of my work is instead the development and portrayal of situations of a specifically vague nature. To this end, I create computer generated sequences of video and audio which situate themselves somewhere between a specific narrative, and a non-event. These video components are then integrated into sculptural or installation settings to exist as multi-channel video objects.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Brandon Morse Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Artist's Talk","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2007-02-13T17:30:00.000Z","end":"2007-02-13T18:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Brandon  Morse","slug":"brandon-morse","new_id":396,"group_type":["External"],"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#b8a898","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/b090f1ae49c60c57461c49d1cf8d23d1/12faa/profile_photo_brandon_morse..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/b090f1ae49c60c57461c49d1cf8d23d1/cd0aa/profile_photo_brandon_morse..jpg 580w,\n/mith-static/static/b090f1ae49c60c57461c49d1cf8d23d1/38d0c/profile_photo_brandon_morse..jpg 1160w,\n/mith-static/static/b090f1ae49c60c57461c49d1cf8d23d1/12faa/profile_photo_brandon_morse..jpg 2320w","sizes":"(min-width: 2320px) 2320px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/b090f1ae49c60c57461c49d1cf8d23d1/f5f74/profile_photo_brandon_morse..webp 580w,\n/mith-static/static/b090f1ae49c60c57461c49d1cf8d23d1/ef17b/profile_photo_brandon_morse..webp 1160w,\n/mith-static/static/b090f1ae49c60c57461c49d1cf8d23d1/3a13d/profile_photo_brandon_morse..webp 2320w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 2320px) 2320px, 100vw"}]},"width":2320,"height":2832}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Brandon Morse is a Washington, DC based artist who works with generative systems as a means to examine the ways in which physical phenomena such as entropy and emergence can function in ways that are both poetic and metaphorical. Through the use of code, and the creation of custom computer software, he creates simulations of seemingly complex systems to create video and video installations that seek to draw parallels between the ways in which these systems work and the ways in which we, both individually and collectively, navigate the world around us.\nProf. Morse has been teaching at Maryland since 2000. He received his BFA from the University of Wisconsin Stevens Point and his MFA in Art &#x26; Technology from The Ohio State University. He has exhbited his work in digital video and sound installation nationally and internationally. Exhibitions include the Corcoran Museum of Art in Washington, DC, the Nanjing Museum in China, the American University Museum at the Katzen Arts Center, Kusthalle Detroit, as well as many gallery exhibitions across the United States, Europe and Asia.</p>"}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"brandon-morse","slug":"brandon-morse"}}],"department":"Department of Art","institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Associate Professor"}}]}}],"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"brandon-morse","slug":"brandon-morse"}}],"department":"Department of Art","institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Associate Professor"}}],"linked_participant_affiliations":null,"linked_participants":null,"linked_links":null,"linked_research_item":[{"data":{"id":"mith-digital-dialogues","title":"Digital Dialogues","image":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/e34e2/header_digital-dialogues..png","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/d61d9/header_digital-dialogues..png 350w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/40d29/header_digital-dialogues..png 700w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/e34e2/header_digital-dialogues..png 1400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/b6bd0/header_digital-dialogues..webp 350w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/c73ac/header_digital-dialogues..webp 700w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/b9745/header_digital-dialogues..webp 1400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":400}}}]}}}],"linked_posts":[{"data":{"author":"digital-dialogues","author_name":"Digital Dialogues","post_date":"February 8, 2007","slug":"february-13th-digital-dialogue-artists-talk-brandon-morse","record_id":"recf2O6TgCkOHGd5O","post_title":"2/13 Digital Dialogue: Artist's Talk by Brandon Morse"}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
