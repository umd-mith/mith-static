The flexibility of the digital medium, as opposed to the rigidity of the printed form, calls for a more modern concept of the music score.\nEven digital sheet music, in most cases, is designed to be printed; it is either produced with typesetting software, or made of images scanned from a printed source. This type of digital score exists in digital form almost exclusively for distribution. The difference between print and digital distribution is access: scores can be downloaded and printed at home.\n<em>Digital consumption</em>, on the other hand, entails reading and performing the score directly from its digital manifestation. Small businesses are already investing in technologies to make the score follow the performer while playing, to support writing and displaying annotations by the performer, a teacher, other peers, etc.\nIn this talk, I’ll address the current status of digital sheet music publication and ask: can the digital consumption of a changeable, customizable publication influence a performer’s advocacy of a work? Textual scholarship and the preparation of critical editions is a fundamental component of this discussion, where I’ll convey editorial transparency as a vital function of digital consumption.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Raffaele Viglianti Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Performing the Digital Edition","talk_subtitle":"Textual Scholarship & the Digital Consumption of Music Scores","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2015-03-24T16:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Raff  Viglianti","slug":"raffaele-viglianti","new_id":6,"group_type":["Staff","External"],"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#584838","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/a46b517dc95515d8b4a8ec5c5a110c97/1f55a/raffaele-viglianti..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/a46b517dc95515d8b4a8ec5c5a110c97/a7b73/raffaele-viglianti..jpg 375w,\n/mith-static/static/a46b517dc95515d8b4a8ec5c5a110c97/0f5ce/raffaele-viglianti..jpg 750w,\n/mith-static/static/a46b517dc95515d8b4a8ec5c5a110c97/1f55a/raffaele-viglianti..jpg 1500w","sizes":"(min-width: 1500px) 1500px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/a46b517dc95515d8b4a8ec5c5a110c97/e3305/raffaele-viglianti..webp 375w,\n/mith-static/static/a46b517dc95515d8b4a8ec5c5a110c97/4f03f/raffaele-viglianti..webp 750w,\n/mith-static/static/a46b517dc95515d8b4a8ec5c5a110c97/07142/raffaele-viglianti..webp 1500w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1500px) 1500px, 100vw"}]},"width":1500,"height":1500}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Raffaele (Raff) Viglianti is a Senior Research Software Developer at MITH.

More specifically, he seeks to advance textual scholarship by finding new and efficient practices to coherently and digitally model and edit (publish, or make available) text and music notation sources as digital scholarly resources. In adopting and developing new research methods, he deliberately takes a multicultural perspective by engaging with multilingual content, facing the diverse realities of the constraints in accessing and creating digital scholarly content, and by adopting a global approach to teaching and learning.\nRaff is currently an elected member of the Text Encoding Initiative technical council and the Technical Editor of the Scholarly Editing journal.</p>"}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"raffaele-viglianti","slug":"raffaele-viglianti"}}],"department":"Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities","institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Research Programmer"}}]}}],"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"raffaele-viglianti","slug":"raffaele-viglianti"}}],"department":"Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities","institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Research Programmer"}}],"linked_participant_affiliations":null,"linked_participants":null,"linked_links":null,"linked_research_item":[{"data":{"id":"mith-digital-dialogues","title":"Digital Dialogues","image":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/e34e2/header_digital-dialogues..png","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/d61d9/header_digital-dialogues..png 350w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/40d29/header_digital-dialogues..png 700w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/e34e2/header_digital-dialogues..png 1400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/b6bd0/header_digital-dialogues..webp 350w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/c73ac/header_digital-dialogues..webp 700w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/b9745/header_digital-dialogues..webp 1400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":400}}}]}}}],"linked_posts":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
