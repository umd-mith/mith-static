Whereas print editions of medieval literary texts typically treat the presence of competing textual versions, authors, and manuscript witnesses as a problem to resolve, either by recreating a hypothetical authorial text or choosing the best extant text to represent an entire textual or narrative tradition, digital manuscript archives are increasingly fostering a re-emergence of the simultaneous presence of competing voices and authorial roles. Digital media are thus allowing us an opportunity to \"get medieval\" in our representations of texts in a manner unprecedented in the age of print. Examples will be drawn from my work on three manuscript archives--the Roman de la Rose Digital Surrogates Project, the Piers Plowman Electronic Archive, and the Siege of Jerusalem Electronic Archive. No familiarity with medieval texts or textual traditions will be assumed or necessary to follow or participate in this discussion!</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Timothy Stinson Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Everything Old Is New Again","talk_subtitle":"The Re-emergence of Medieval Polyvocality in Digital Manuscript Archives","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2006-10-03T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2006-10-03T17:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Timothy  Stinson","slug":"timothy-stinson","new_id":543,"group_type":["External"],"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#686868","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/d62389593e8f8a96faf2d2609c8c311e/aea80/timothy-stinson..png","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/d62389593e8f8a96faf2d2609c8c311e/e095e/timothy-stinson..png 81w,\n/mith-static/static/d62389593e8f8a96faf2d2609c8c311e/3eb37/timothy-stinson..png 163w,\n/mith-static/static/d62389593e8f8a96faf2d2609c8c311e/aea80/timothy-stinson..png 325w","sizes":"(min-width: 325px) 325px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/d62389593e8f8a96faf2d2609c8c311e/ecb23/timothy-stinson..webp 81w,\n/mith-static/static/d62389593e8f8a96faf2d2609c8c311e/2b75e/timothy-stinson..webp 163w,\n/mith-static/static/d62389593e8f8a96faf2d2609c8c311e/f7ee1/timothy-stinson..webp 325w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 325px) 325px, 100vw"}]},"width":325,"height":487.00000000000006}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"timothy-stinson","slug":"timothy-stinson"}}],"department":null,"institution":"Johns Hopkins University","title":"Postdoctoral Fellow"}}]}}],"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"timothy-stinson","slug":"timothy-stinson"}}],"department":null,"institution":"Johns Hopkins University","title":"Postdoctoral Fellow"}}],"linked_participant_affiliations":null,"linked_participants":null,"linked_links":null,"linked_research_item":[{"data":{"id":"mith-digital-dialogues","title":"Digital Dialogues","image":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/e34e2/header_digital-dialogues..png","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/d61d9/header_digital-dialogues..png 350w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/40d29/header_digital-dialogues..png 700w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/e34e2/header_digital-dialogues..png 1400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/b6bd0/header_digital-dialogues..webp 350w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/c73ac/header_digital-dialogues..webp 700w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/b9745/header_digital-dialogues..webp 1400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":400}}}]}}}],"linked_posts":[{"data":{"author":"digital-dialogues","author_name":"Digital Dialogues","post_date":"September 28, 2006","slug":"october-3rd-digital-dialogue-timothy-stinson-polyvocality-in-digital-manuscript-archives","record_id":"recihkKOqkzlO7z2b","post_title":"10/3 Digital Dialogue: Timothy Stinson"}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
