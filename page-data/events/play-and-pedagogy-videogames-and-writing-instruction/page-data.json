This presentation examines the role of computer gaming in composition pedagogy, positioning games as objects of critique that are available for use in writing classes, and as locations of production for multimedia/multimodal texts. Using the example of massive multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs), Dr. Eyman will present a five-part ecological framework for situating game activities as specific genres of production that can be used in writing classes.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Douglas Eyman Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Play and Pedagogy","talk_subtitle":"Videogames and Writing Instruction","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2008-02-26T17:30:00.000Z","end":"2008-02-26T18:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Douglas Eyman","slug":"douglas-eyman","new_id":422,"group_type":["External"],"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"douglas-eyman","slug":"douglas-eyman"}}],"department":"Department of English","institution":"George Mason University","title":"Assistant Professor"}}]}}],"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"douglas-eyman","slug":"douglas-eyman"}}],"department":"Department of English","institution":"George Mason University","title":"Assistant Professor"}}],"linked_participant_affiliations":null,"linked_participants":null,"linked_links":null,"linked_research_item":[{"data":{"id":"mith-digital-dialogues","title":"Digital Dialogues","image":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/e34e2/header_digital-dialogues..png","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/d61d9/header_digital-dialogues..png 350w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/40d29/header_digital-dialogues..png 700w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/e34e2/header_digital-dialogues..png 1400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/b6bd0/header_digital-dialogues..webp 350w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/c73ac/header_digital-dialogues..webp 700w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/b9745/header_digital-dialogues..webp 1400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":400}}}]}}}],"linked_posts":[{"data":{"author":"digital-dialogues","author_name":"Digital Dialogues","post_date":"February 19, 2008","slug":"february-26th-digital-dialogue-douglas-eyman-play-and-pedagogy-video-games-and-writing-instruction","record_id":"recC4vtT7VigPoPEv","post_title":"2/26 MITH Digital Dialogue: Douglas Eyman, \"Play and Pedagogy: Video Games and Writing Instruction\""}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
