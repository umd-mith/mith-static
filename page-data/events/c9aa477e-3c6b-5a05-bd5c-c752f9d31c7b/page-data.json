Mellon Professor at the Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts (National Gallery). His specific area of research has mostly focused on the cultural history of National Socialist Germany and its postwar impact on art and architecture. He has published a number of essays that explored the political function of architecture in the modern period, leading up to his most recent book <em>The Nazi Perpetrator: Postwar German Art and the Politics of the Right</em> (Minnesota 2012). These interests have also led to his involvement over the past decade with the Holocaust Geography Collaborative, a coalition of 8 international scholars who specialize in both Holocaust Studies and GIS. Their research has most recently resulted in the anthology <em>Geographies of the Holocaust</em> (2014) for which Jaskot co-authored three chapters. He is currently exploring with Anne Kelly Knowles the potential for using Historical GIS to explore issues of forced labor and the construction industry in Nazi Germany. In addition to his research, Jaskot has served as President of the College Art Association (2008–2010).</p>"}}}],"participants":[{"name":"Neil Fraistat","title":"Director","department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland","start":2006,"end":2017,"person_group":null,"slug":"neil-fraistat","new_id":22},{"name":"Stephanie Sapienza","title":"Project Manager","department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland","start":2013,"end":2018,"person_group":["current"],"slug":"stephanie-sapienza","new_id":7},{"name":"Meredith J.
