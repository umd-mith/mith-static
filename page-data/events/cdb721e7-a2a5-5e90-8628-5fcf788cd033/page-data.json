How can we provide robust, large-scale TEI publication services, while accommodating the detailed scholarly insight that makes TEI such a valuable tool for the digital humanities? What level of customization and variation can we support without compromising on interoperability, and what are the mechanisms by which we can achieve the optimal balance? And who needs variation anyway—what kinds of scholarly insight are at stake, or at risk?\nTAPAS seeks to offer long-term TEI repository and publishing services, with special focus on supporting scholars who lack access to XML publishing infrastructure or expertise at their own institutions. Supported by a planning grant from the IMLS and now by a two-year IMLS National Leadership Grant and an NEH Digital Humanities Startup Grant, the TAPAS service will make it possible for scholars to use TEI in their teaching and research without mastering the full suite of XML technologies. The service will also provide access to consulting, training, documentation, and community-developed tools. This talk will explore the conceptual and strategic challenges in developing TAPAS, and in particular the problem of how to harmonize—or transcend—divergent approaches to TEI encoding.</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Julia Flanders Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Small TEI Projects on a Large Scale: TAPAS","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2012-09-21T19:30:00.000Z","end":"2012-09-21T20:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"name":"Julia Flanders","affiliations":[{"title":"Director","department":"Women Writers Project","institution":"Brown University Library"},{"title":"Editor-in-Chief","department":null,"institution":"Digital Humanities Quarterly"}],"person_group":null,"slug":"julia-flanders","new_id":288,"headshot":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#787878","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/f44bf4dca5523d39aea302d627afae78/dd515/SZ_D78IquNbRwd38MS5ym38HG5wy92aSohOLQydgeAA.jpg","srcSet":"/static/f44bf4dca5523d39aea302d627afae78/6ac16/SZ_D78IquNbRwd38MS5ym38HG5wy92aSohOLQydgeAA.jpg 50w,\n/static/f44bf4dca5523d39aea302d627afae78/e07e1/SZ_D78IquNbRwd38MS5ym38HG5wy92aSohOLQydgeAA.jpg 100w,\n/static/f44bf4dca5523d39aea302d627afae78/dd515/SZ_D78IquNbRwd38MS5ym38HG5wy92aSohOLQydgeAA.jpg 200w","sizes":"(min-width: 200px) 200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/f44bf4dca5523d39aea302d627afae78/dbc4a/SZ_D78IquNbRwd38MS5ym38HG5wy92aSohOLQydgeAA.webp 50w,\n/static/f44bf4dca5523d39aea302d627afae78/d8057/SZ_D78IquNbRwd38MS5ym38HG5wy92aSohOLQydgeAA.webp 100w,\n/static/f44bf4dca5523d39aea302d627afae78/2e34e/SZ_D78IquNbRwd38MS5ym38HG5wy92aSohOLQydgeAA.webp 200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 200px) 200px, 100vw"}]},"width":200,"height":200}}},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p><strong>Julia Flanders</strong> is the Director of the Women Writers Project, part of the Center for Digital Scholarship in the Brown University Library.
