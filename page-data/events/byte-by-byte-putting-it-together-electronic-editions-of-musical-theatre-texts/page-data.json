Musical theatre seems particularly well-suited, though, to the multimedia capabilities of the modern PC. This presentation will explore the ways in which electronic editions of musicals would not only be of use to musical theatre scholars, but might also help to develop a wider audience for artistically-minded (as opposed to commercially-driven) musicals. This talk outlines the benefits offered by electronic editions and describes the steps taken by the author to develop an AJAX-based electronic edition of the 1998 musical Parade.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Doug Reside Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Byte By Byte, Putting It Together: Electronic Editions of Musical Theatre Texts","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2006-11-08T17:30:00.000Z","end":"2006-11-08T18:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Doug Reside","slug":"douglas-reside","new_id":29,"group_type":["Past","External"],"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/f84486fb33fd5787f4f4e6da4edf3ce5/3c367/Doug-Reside..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/f84486fb33fd5787f4f4e6da4edf3ce5/19e71/Doug-Reside..jpg 128w,\n/mith-static/static/f84486fb33fd5787f4f4e6da4edf3ce5/68974/Doug-Reside..jpg 256w,\n/mith-static/static/f84486fb33fd5787f4f4e6da4edf3ce5/3c367/Doug-Reside..jpg 512w","sizes":"(min-width: 512px) 512px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/f84486fb33fd5787f4f4e6da4edf3ce5/6766a/Doug-Reside..webp 128w,\n/mith-static/static/f84486fb33fd5787f4f4e6da4edf3ce5/22bfc/Doug-Reside..webp 256w,\n/mith-static/static/f84486fb33fd5787f4f4e6da4edf3ce5/d689f/Doug-Reside..webp 512w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 512px) 512px, 100vw"}]},"width":512,"height":512}}},{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/6cd600f0dc74ff762ed72a74d036d209/85f90/staff_dreside..png","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/6cd600f0dc74ff762ed72a74d036d209/59c6d/staff_dreside..png 29w,\n/mith-static/static/6cd600f0dc74ff762ed72a74d036d209/e3e5e/staff_dreside..png 58w,\n/mith-static/static/6cd600f0dc74ff762ed72a74d036d209/85f90/staff_dreside..png 115w","sizes":"(min-width: 115px) 115px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/6cd600f0dc74ff762ed72a74d036d209/bc2ec/staff_dreside..webp 29w,\n/mith-static/static/6cd600f0dc74ff762ed72a74d036d209/6262e/staff_dreside..webp 58w,\n/mith-static/static/6cd600f0dc74ff762ed72a74d036d209/1f876/staff_dreside..webp 115w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 115px) 115px, 100vw"}]},"width":115,"height":150}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p><strong>Doug Reside</strong> is Assistant Director of the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH).
