It is arguably the largest written tradition up to its day, rivalled only by medieval Chinese. I focus, first, on recent work assembling a corpus of 1.3 billion words and the composition of this corpus, including the large number of sizable works. I consider these works in light of evidence for a much larger body of no-longer extant material. Second, I introduce the concept of text “reuse,” our method for detecting and measuring it, and my theory. The theory is this: that the substantial reuse of earlier works resulted both in the emergence of very large works, especially from the 10th century onwards, and secondly, that this reuse resulted in the loss of earlier texts, now absorbed in various ways (including abridgement) into larger ones. Finally, I examine the cultural expectations underpinning reuse, and also how they should make us reconsider, at different times and places, notions of the “book” and “authorship.”</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Sarah Savant Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"How Were So Many Arabic Authors So Prolific?","talk_subtitle":"Digital Evidence for the Origins and Development of a Historical Textual Tradition","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2018-10-25T16:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Sarah Bowen Savant","slug":"sarah-bowen-savant","new_id":342,"group_type":["External"],"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Sarah Bowen Savant is a cultural historian, focusing on early Islamic history and history writing up to 1100, with a special focus on Iraq and Iran.
