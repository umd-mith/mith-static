Lu earned her Ph.D. in Communication and Graduate Certificate in Women's Studies from the University of Maryland, College Park, where she now serves as the Associate Director of Design Cultures &#x26; Creativity (DCC) in the Honors College. Trained as a rhetorical critic, she is concerned with how we can practice greater care for past, present, and future humans---especially those whose lives are shaped by precarity and state-sanctioned violence---in the ways we use language to create, design, and destroy our worlds. She examines, in particular, the ideas and rhetorical practices that form, advance, and disrupt racist logics in public discourse in the United States. Her work is further positioned at the intersections of African American history, archives, and digital humanities, as she specializes in adapting the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) standard of scholarly markup to critically model, analyze, and amplify Black people's practices of rhetorical invention and innovation.</p>"}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"jessica-h-lu","slug":"jessica-h-lu"}}],"department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Postdoctoral Associate, AADHum"}}]}},{"data":{"name":"Amy  Wickner","slug":"amy-wickner","new_id":200,"group_type":["External"],"affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"amy-wickner","slug":"amy-wickner"}}],"department":null,"institution":"University of Maryland Libraries","title":"Electronic Records Archivist"}}]}},{"data":{"name":"Matthew Thomas  Miller","slug":"matthew-thomas-miller","new_id":14,"group_type":["Affiliates","External"],"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#484848","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/2ccea2bb81054804c1ea470dd50566d1/3c367/matthew-thomas-miller..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/2ccea2bb81054804c1ea470dd50566d1/19e71/matthew-thomas-miller..jpg 128w,\n/mith-static/static/2ccea2bb81054804c1ea470dd50566d1/68974/matthew-thomas-miller..jpg 256w,\n/mith-static/static/2ccea2bb81054804c1ea470dd50566d1/3c367/matthew-thomas-miller..jpg 512w","sizes":"(min-width: 512px) 512px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/2ccea2bb81054804c1ea470dd50566d1/6766a/matthew-thomas-miller..webp 128w,\n/mith-static/static/2ccea2bb81054804c1ea470dd50566d1/22bfc/matthew-thomas-miller..webp 256w,\n/mith-static/static/2ccea2bb81054804c1ea470dd50566d1/d689f/matthew-thomas-miller..webp 512w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 512px) 512px, 100vw"}]},"width":512,"height":512}}}]},"affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"matthew-thomas-miller","slug":"matthew-thomas-miller"}}],"department":"School of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures","institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Assistant Professor of Persian Literature and Digital Humanities"}}]}}],"sponsors":null,"partners":[{"data":{"name":"University of Maryland Libraries","website":"lib.umd.edu","type":"Internal","slug":"umdlib"}},{"data":{"name":"Digital Library Federation","website":null,"type":"External","slug":"dlf"}}],"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"kelley-oneal","slug":"kelley-oneal"}}],"department":null,"institution":"University of Maryland Libraries","title":null}},{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"maddie-clybourn","slug":"maddie-clybourn"}}],"department":null,"institution":"Prince George’s County Memorial Public Library System","title":null}},{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"jessica-h-lu","slug":"jessica-h-lu"}}],"department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Postdoctoral Associate, AADHum"}},{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"amy-wickner","slug":"amy-wickner"}}],"department":null,"institution":"University of Maryland Libraries","title":"Electronic Records Archivist"}},{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"matthew-thomas-miller","slug":"matthew-thomas-miller"}}],"department":"School of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures","institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Assistant Professor of Persian Literature and Digital Humanities"}}],"linked_participant_affiliations":null,"linked_participants":null,"linked_links":[{"data":{"title":"Endangered Data Week, DLF","url":"http://endangereddataweek.org/","type":"url"}}],"linked_research_item":[{"data":{"id":"endangered-data-week","title":"Endangered Data Week","image":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/d93b91ad61738895a84f75be48618b03/27174/header_edw..png","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/d93b91ad61738895a84f75be48618b03/edb07/header_edw..png 350w,\n/mith-static/static/d93b91ad61738895a84f75be48618b03/9935d/header_edw..png 700w,\n/mith-static/static/d93b91ad61738895a84f75be48618b03/27174/header_edw..png 1400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/d93b91ad61738895a84f75be48618b03/3a335/header_edw..webp 350w,\n/mith-static/static/d93b91ad61738895a84f75be48618b03/4e696/header_edw..webp 700w,\n/mith-static/static/d93b91ad61738895a84f75be48618b03/52987/header_edw..webp 1400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":316}}}]}}}],"linked_posts":[{"data":{"author":"purdom-lindblad","author_name":"Purdom Lindblad","post_date":"February 19, 2018","slug":"endangered-data-week-february-26-march-2-2018","record_id":"rec5vOQOFCD7JAPHX","post_title":"Endangered Data Week, February 26 - March 2, 2018"}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
