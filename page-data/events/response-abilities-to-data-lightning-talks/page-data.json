Lu earned her Ph.D. in Communication and Graduate Certificate in Women’s Studies from the University of Maryland, College Park, where she now serves as the Associate Director of Design Cultures &#x26; Creativity (DCC) in the Honors College.\nTrained as a rhetorical critic, she is concerned with how we can practice greater care for past, present, and future humans—especially those whose lives are shaped by precarity and state-sanctioned violence—in the ways we use language to create, design, and destroy our worlds. She examines, in particular, the ideas and rhetorical practices that form, advance, and disrupt racist logics in public discourse in the United States. Her work is further positioned at the intersections of African American history, archives, and digital humanities, as she specializes in adapting the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) standard of scholarly markup to critically model, analyze, and amplify Black people’s practices of rhetorical invention and innovation.</p>"}}},{"name":"Amy Wickner","affiliations":[{"title":"Electronic Records Archivist","department":null,"institution":"University of Maryland Libraries"}],"person_group":null,"slug":"amy-wickner","new_id":200},{"name":"Matthew Thomas Miller","affiliations":[{"title":"Assistant Professor of Persian Literature and Digital Humanities","department":"School of Languages, Literatures, and Cultures","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"person_group":null,"slug":"matthew-thomas-miller","new_id":14,"headshot":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#484848","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/2ccea2bb81054804c1ea470dd50566d1/3c367/matthew-thomas-miller.jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/2ccea2bb81054804c1ea470dd50566d1/19e71/matthew-thomas-miller.jpg 128w,\n/mith-static/static/2ccea2bb81054804c1ea470dd50566d1/68974/matthew-thomas-miller.jpg 256w,\n/mith-static/static/2ccea2bb81054804c1ea470dd50566d1/3c367/matthew-thomas-miller.jpg 512w","sizes":"(min-width: 512px) 512px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/2ccea2bb81054804c1ea470dd50566d1/6766a/matthew-thomas-miller.webp 128w,\n/mith-static/static/2ccea2bb81054804c1ea470dd50566d1/22bfc/matthew-thomas-miller.webp 256w,\n/mith-static/static/2ccea2bb81054804c1ea470dd50566d1/d689f/matthew-thomas-miller.webp 512w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 512px) 512px, 100vw"}]},"width":512,"height":512}}}}],"participants":[],"links":[{"title":"Endangered Data Week, DLF","url":"http://endangereddataweek.org/","type":"url"}],"sponsors":[],"partners":[{"name":"University of Maryland Libraries","website":"lib.umd.edu","type":"Internal","slug":"umdlib"},{"name":"Digital Library Federation","website":null,"type":"External","slug":"dlf"}],"research":[{"id":"endangered-data-week","title":"Endangered Data Week","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#383838","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/d93b91ad61738895a84f75be48618b03/27174/header_edw.png","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/d93b91ad61738895a84f75be48618b03/edb07/header_edw.png 350w,\n/mith-static/static/d93b91ad61738895a84f75be48618b03/9935d/header_edw.png 700w,\n/mith-static/static/d93b91ad61738895a84f75be48618b03/27174/header_edw.png 1400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/d93b91ad61738895a84f75be48618b03/3a335/header_edw.webp 350w,\n/mith-static/static/d93b91ad61738895a84f75be48618b03/4e696/header_edw.webp 700w,\n/mith-static/static/d93b91ad61738895a84f75be48618b03/52987/header_edw.webp 1400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":316}}}}],"posts":[{"post_title":"Endangered Data Week, February 26 - March 2, 2018","author":"purdom-lindblad","author_name":"Purdom Lindblad","post_date":"February 19, 2018","slug":"endangered-data-week-february-26-march-2-2018"}],"disciplines":[],"methods":[]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"]}
