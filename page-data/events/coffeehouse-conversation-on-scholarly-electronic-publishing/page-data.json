The discussion will be facilitated by Katie King (Associate Professor of Women’s Studies), Matthew Kirschenbaum (Assistant Professor of English and Articles Editor for the online journal Digital Humanities Quarterly), and Claire Moses (Professor of Women’s Studies and Editorial Director of the journal Feminist Studies).\nThe format will be open and freewheeling, with plenty of opportunity for asking questions and exchanging ideas. Topics that might be expected to come up include: what it means to “publish” online; peer review, credit, and perceptions of prestige for online publishing; editorial standards in electronic journals; copyright and the economics of scholarly publishing in the present climate; whether the journal format itself is viable online, or whether blogs, bulletin boards, and other forums are more appropriate; libraries and electronic journals; how new media will alter the materiality and substance of scholarship; and the longevity of the scholarly record as it sheds its traditional embodiment in paper.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Coffeehouse Conversation on Scholarly Electronic Publishing","talk_title":null,"talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Other Event"],"start":"2006-03-29T20:30:00.000Z","end":"2006-03-29T21:45:00.000Z","location":null,"speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Katie King","slug":"katie-king","new_id":135,"group_type":["Past","External"],"affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"katie-king","slug":"katie-king"}}],"department":"Women's Studies","institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Associate Professor"}}]}},{"data":{"name":"Matthew Kirschenbaum","slug":"matthew-kirschenbaum","new_id":11,"group_type":["Affiliates","Past","External"],"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#786858","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/92c5979478d9540f9766b7056322b607/0fdf4/matthew-kirschenbaum..jpg","srcSet":"/static/92c5979478d9540f9766b7056322b607/91a6d/matthew-kirschenbaum..jpg 75w,\n/static/92c5979478d9540f9766b7056322b607/96deb/matthew-kirschenbaum..jpg 150w,\n/static/92c5979478d9540f9766b7056322b607/0fdf4/matthew-kirschenbaum..jpg 300w","sizes":"(min-width: 300px) 300px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/92c5979478d9540f9766b7056322b607/18188/matthew-kirschenbaum..webp 75w,\n/static/92c5979478d9540f9766b7056322b607/c65bc/matthew-kirschenbaum..webp 150w,\n/static/92c5979478d9540f9766b7056322b607/078c3/matthew-kirschenbaum..webp 300w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 300px) 300px, 100vw"}]},"width":300,"height":300}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"matthew-kirschenbaum","slug":"matthew-kirschenbaum"}}],"department":"Department of English","institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Assistant Professor"}}]}},{"data":{"name":"Claire Moses","slug":"claire-moses","new_id":576,"group_type":["External"],"affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"claire-moses","slug":"claire-moses"}}],"department":null,"institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Professor of Women’s Studies and Editorial Director of the journal Feminist Studies"}}]}}],"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"katie-king","slug":"katie-king"}}],"department":"Women's Studies","institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Associate Professor"}},{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"matthew-kirschenbaum","slug":"matthew-kirschenbaum"}}],"department":"Department of English","institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Assistant Professor"}},{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"claire-moses","slug":"claire-moses"}}],"department":null,"institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Professor of Women’s Studies and Editorial Director of the journal Feminist Studies"}}],"linked_participant_affiliations":null,"linked_participants":null,"linked_links":null,"linked_research_item":null,"linked_posts":[{"data":{"author":"mith","author_name":"MITH ","post_date":"March 21, 2006","slug":"march-29th-coffeehouse-conversation-on-scholarly-electronic-publishing","record_id":"recbJ18NGk5o2UXlJ","post_title":"3/29 Coffeehouse Conversation on Scholarly Electronic Publishing"}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
