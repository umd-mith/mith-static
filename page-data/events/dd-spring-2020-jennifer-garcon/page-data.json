With sadness, we canceled the final two Digital Dialogues of the Spring 2020 season. We will work with Jennifer Garcon on a plan to speak at a later date.</em>\nIn support of the Re/Member Black Philadelphia project, Garcon launched a community data curation pilot in partnership with the Free Library of Philadelphia. The goal of the community-rooted digitization project was to create access pathways to historical records from under-documented communities by producing digital surrogates and offering consultation to expand the life of materials held within the communities of color. As Philadelphia gentrifies at a faster rate than San Francisco, well-resourced institutions need to develop inclusive practices that support on-going community archival efforts. This talk discusses the experience of building an institutional practice that foregrounds partnership and resource sharing in developing digital archives.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Jennifer Garcon Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Building a Community Data Curation Practice","talk_subtitle":"Digital Archiving through Partnership and Resource Sharing","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2020-03-24T16:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Jennifer  Garcon","slug":"jennifer-garcon","new_id":453,"group_type":["External"],"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#e8e8e8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/a5262c77855e49ea007f7a8256902415/baaed/jennifer-garcon..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/a5262c77855e49ea007f7a8256902415/dd515/jennifer-garcon..jpg 200w,\n/mith-static/static/a5262c77855e49ea007f7a8256902415/47930/jennifer-garcon..jpg 400w,\n/mith-static/static/a5262c77855e49ea007f7a8256902415/baaed/jennifer-garcon..jpg 800w","sizes":"(min-width: 800px) 800px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/a5262c77855e49ea007f7a8256902415/2e34e/jennifer-garcon..webp 200w,\n/mith-static/static/a5262c77855e49ea007f7a8256902415/416c3/jennifer-garcon..webp 400w,\n/mith-static/static/a5262c77855e49ea007f7a8256902415/c1587/jennifer-garcon..webp 800w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 800px) 800px, 100vw"}]},"width":800,"height":800}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"jennifer-garcon","slug":"jennifer-garcon"}}],"department":null,"institution":"University of Pennsylvania","title":"Bollinger Fellow in Public and Community Data Curation"}}]}}],"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"jennifer-garcon","slug":"jennifer-garcon"}}],"department":null,"institution":"University of Pennsylvania","title":"Bollinger Fellow in Public and Community Data Curation"}}],"linked_participant_affiliations":null,"linked_participants":null,"linked_links":null,"linked_research_item":[{"data":{"id":"mith-digital-dialogues","title":"Digital Dialogues","image":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/e34e2/header_digital-dialogues..png","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/d61d9/header_digital-dialogues..png 350w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/40d29/header_digital-dialogues..png 700w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/e34e2/header_digital-dialogues..png 1400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/b6bd0/header_digital-dialogues..webp 350w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/c73ac/header_digital-dialogues..webp 700w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/b9745/header_digital-dialogues..webp 1400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":400}}}]}}}],"linked_posts":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
