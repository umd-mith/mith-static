However, the ubiquity of easy mapping interfaces and handheld devices is now bringing GIS to the attention of researchers beyond science, architecture, and engineering. The Scholars' Lab at the University of Virginia Library is developing a new technical infrastructure and discovery mechanism to aggregate and visually layer terabytes of its own geospatial data with open-access information on the Web. But can we design a system to meet the special interpretive requirements of the humanities? How can we serve disciplines for which subjectivity inflects results, and ambiguous or contradictory evidence necessarily shapes every map?</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Bethany Nowviskie Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"New World Ordering","talk_subtitle":"Shaping Geospatial Information for Scholarly Use","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2008-11-04T17:30:00.000Z","end":"2008-11-04T18:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"name":"Bethany Nowviskie","affiliations":[{"title":"Director of Digital Research and Scholarship","department":null,"institution":"University of Virginia Library"}],"person_group":null,"slug":"bethany-nowviskie","new_id":392,"headshot":null,"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p><strong>Bethany Nowviskie</strong> is Director of Digital Research &#x26; Scholarship at the <a href=\"http://lib.virginia.edu/\">University of Virginia Library</a>, Associate Director of the <a href=\"http://uvasci.org/\">Scholarly Communication Institute</a>, and President of the <a href=\"http://ach.org/\">Association for Computers and the Humanities </a>(ACH).
