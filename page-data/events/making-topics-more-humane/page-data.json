Topic models, which automatically discover the themes which permeate a corpus, are a popular tool for discovering what’s being discussed. However, topic models aren’t perfect; errors hamper adoption of the model, performance in downstream computational tasks, and human understanding of the data. However, humans can easily diagnose and fix these errors. We present a statistically sound model to incorporate hints and suggestions from humans to iteratively refine topic models to better model large datasets.\nWe also examine how topic models can be used to understand topic control in debates and discussions. We demonstrate a technique that can identify when speakers are “controlling” the topic of a conversation, which can identify events such as when participants in a debate don’t answer a question, when pundits steer a conversation toward talking points, or when a moderator exerts her influence on a discourse.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Jordan Boyd-Graber Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Making Topics More Human(e)","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2012-04-10T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2012-04-10T17:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Seminar Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Jordan Boyd-Graber","slug":"jordan-boyd-graber","new_id":463,"group_type":["External"],"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/ac2790e235632f9513725ecb26b21c83/3a19d/Jordan-Boyd-Graber1..png","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/ac2790e235632f9513725ecb26b21c83/cecf4/Jordan-Boyd-Graber1..png 188w,\n/mith-static/static/ac2790e235632f9513725ecb26b21c83/66aec/Jordan-Boyd-Graber1..png 375w,\n/mith-static/static/ac2790e235632f9513725ecb26b21c83/3a19d/Jordan-Boyd-Graber1..png 750w","sizes":"(min-width: 750px) 750px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/ac2790e235632f9513725ecb26b21c83/8fe1c/Jordan-Boyd-Graber1..webp 188w,\n/mith-static/static/ac2790e235632f9513725ecb26b21c83/fc9e8/Jordan-Boyd-Graber1..webp 375w,\n/mith-static/static/ac2790e235632f9513725ecb26b21c83/520c4/Jordan-Boyd-Graber1..webp 750w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 750px) 750px, 100vw"}]},"width":750,"height":633}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"jordan-boyd-graber","slug":"jordan-boyd-graber"}}],"department":"School of Information Studies and Institute for Advanced Computer Studies (UMIACS)","institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Assistant Professor"}}]}}],"sponsors":[{"data":{"name":"Department of Computer Science","website":"cs.umd.edu","type":"Internal","slug":"dept_cs"}}],"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"jordan-boyd-graber","slug":"jordan-boyd-graber"}}],"department":"School of Information Studies and Institute for Advanced Computer Studies (UMIACS)","institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Assistant Professor"}}],"linked_participant_affiliations":null,"linked_participants":null,"linked_links":[{"data":{"title":"Watch Keynote","url":"http://mith.umd.edu/digital-dialogues/slides/dd_2012_04_10.key","type":"file_link"}}],"linked_research_item":[{"data":{"id":"mith-digital-dialogues","title":"Digital Dialogues","image":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/e34e2/header_digital-dialogues..png","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/d61d9/header_digital-dialogues..png 350w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/40d29/header_digital-dialogues..png 700w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/e34e2/header_digital-dialogues..png 1400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/b6bd0/header_digital-dialogues..webp 350w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/c73ac/header_digital-dialogues..webp 700w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/b9745/header_digital-dialogues..webp 1400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":400}}}]}}}],"linked_posts":[{"data":{"author":"digital-dialogues","author_name":"Digital Dialogues","post_date":"April 4, 2012","slug":"410-mith-digital-dialogue-jordan-boyd-graber-making-topics-more-humane","record_id":"recME2x7of3vPhE56","post_title":"4/10 MITH Digital Dialogue: Jordan Boyd-Graber, \"Making Topics More Human(e)\""}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
