Vega will be a free, editorial-management platform that supports peer review, copy-editing, and publication of multimedia-rich and data-driven scholarship and creative works in all areas of research. With the support of an Andrew W. Mellon Foundation grant, Vega is being designed with a unique editorial workflow that recognizes and values the importance of screen-based multimedia research, including digital humanities projects and electronic literature. What many journals and presses that publish this kind of work lack is an editorial management system that will move a piece of scholarly multimedia through the submission, review, and production processes as a single, scholarly entity. I will discuss the platform, its authorial and editorial features, and welcome questions and comments from an audience of potential users of Vega, which is only part-way through its first year of a three-year development cycle.</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Cheryl Ball Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"The Archipelago of Multimedia Publishing","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2015-10-13T16:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"name":"Cheryl Ball","affiliations":[{"title":"Associate Professor of Digital Publishing","department":null,"institution":"West Virginia University"}],"person_group":null,"slug":"cheryl-ball","new_id":401,"headshot":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#b8b8b8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/444fc56c2c364112de1185426ccaba28/9fd8f/cutawor1-7So5pzauMnH5IFcEjo21iTWUfxZ7Zu7cUw.jpg","srcSet":"/static/444fc56c2c364112de1185426ccaba28/790fb/cutawor1-7So5pzauMnH5IFcEjo21iTWUfxZ7Zu7cUw.jpg 70w,\n/static/444fc56c2c364112de1185426ccaba28/00626/cutawor1-7So5pzauMnH5IFcEjo21iTWUfxZ7Zu7cUw.jpg 140w,\n/static/444fc56c2c364112de1185426ccaba28/9fd8f/cutawor1-7So5pzauMnH5IFcEjo21iTWUfxZ7Zu7cUw.jpg 280w","sizes":"(min-width: 280px) 280px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/444fc56c2c364112de1185426ccaba28/7f19d/cutawor1-7So5pzauMnH5IFcEjo21iTWUfxZ7Zu7cUw.webp 70w,\n/static/444fc56c2c364112de1185426ccaba28/35ad7/cutawor1-7So5pzauMnH5IFcEjo21iTWUfxZ7Zu7cUw.webp 140w,\n/static/444fc56c2c364112de1185426ccaba28/4c653/cutawor1-7So5pzauMnH5IFcEjo21iTWUfxZ7Zu7cUw.webp 280w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 280px) 280px, 100vw"}]},"width":280,"height":299}}},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Cheryl Ball studies and teaches rhetorical activities and genres in digital media and publishing contexts, emphasizing how users learn to analyze and produce texts for professional purposes.
