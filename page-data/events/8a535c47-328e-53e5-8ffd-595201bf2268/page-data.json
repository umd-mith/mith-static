The workshop gathered 50 digital humanities scholars and developers, who along with industry leaders demonstrated their APIs during this “working weekend.” We discussed ways that existing and future APIs could be leveraged for digital humanities projects.\nThe workshop format consisted of morning presentations and afternoon unconferencing. We also scheduled time for lightning talks. Some participants sought to explore hands-on hacking of APIs following presentations; others discussed ways that they could use an existing API. The workshop included participants of varying skill levels and technical knowledge, and engaged both developers and project managers.\nQuestions can be directed to Dave Lester: <a href=\"mailto:dlester@umd.edu\">dlester@umd.edu</a>.</p>"}},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/cdb3303144061cf32963af9e20baaead/716c3/krn73mN9Kfo6qYUDv_3cHkB28CxlkuvZ8MMHFPgotRE.png","srcSet":"/static/cdb3303144061cf32963af9e20baaead/e1907/krn73mN9Kfo6qYUDv_3cHkB28CxlkuvZ8MMHFPgotRE.png 150w,\n/static/cdb3303144061cf32963af9e20baaead/0ca00/krn73mN9Kfo6qYUDv_3cHkB28CxlkuvZ8MMHFPgotRE.png 300w,\n/static/cdb3303144061cf32963af9e20baaead/716c3/krn73mN9Kfo6qYUDv_3cHkB28CxlkuvZ8MMHFPgotRE.png 600w","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/cdb3303144061cf32963af9e20baaead/b41db/krn73mN9Kfo6qYUDv_3cHkB28CxlkuvZ8MMHFPgotRE.webp 150w,\n/static/cdb3303144061cf32963af9e20baaead/9d5e2/krn73mN9Kfo6qYUDv_3cHkB28CxlkuvZ8MMHFPgotRE.webp 300w,\n/static/cdb3303144061cf32963af9e20baaead/9a4d4/krn73mN9Kfo6qYUDv_3cHkB28CxlkuvZ8MMHFPgotRE.webp 600w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":700}}}},"event_title":"API Workshop","talk_title":null,"talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Workshop"],"start":"2011-02-25T05:00:00.000Z","end":"2011-02-26T05:00:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"name":"George Oates","affiliations":[{"title":"Project Lead","department":"Open Library","institution":"Internet Archive"}],"person_group":null,"slug":"george-oates","new_id":589,"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p><strong>George Oates</strong> has worked on the web since 1996, in a variety of roles that normally revolve around front-end design and online community.
