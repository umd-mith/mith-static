To celebrate everyone's great work, MITH will be hosting a capstone event and party on **Monday, December 17, from 1:00-3:00 pm **(Hornbake 0301).\nLibrarians and staff who have participated in the Incubator process will present very brief \"project pitches\" describing their ideas for digital projects. In the spring, MITH will continue collaborating on the best of these proposals—to help create the first version of the digital project. We'll be hearing presentations from across every division of the Libraries. So, no matter which project is selected, this capstone event will be a great demonstration of the creativity and scholarship of Maryland librarians and staff.\n<strong>Please, come join us and support your colleagues!</strong>\nCookies and light refreshments will be served.</p>"}},"image":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#486878","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/6c1414ea26488ce343f3a96df67fe1d1/716c3/event_dhincubator..png","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/6c1414ea26488ce343f3a96df67fe1d1/e1907/event_dhincubator..png 150w,\n/mith-static/static/6c1414ea26488ce343f3a96df67fe1d1/0ca00/event_dhincubator..png 300w,\n/mith-static/static/6c1414ea26488ce343f3a96df67fe1d1/716c3/event_dhincubator..png 600w","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/6c1414ea26488ce343f3a96df67fe1d1/b41db/event_dhincubator..webp 150w,\n/mith-static/static/6c1414ea26488ce343f3a96df67fe1d1/9d5e2/event_dhincubator..webp 300w,\n/mith-static/static/6c1414ea26488ce343f3a96df67fe1d1/9a4d4/event_dhincubator..webp 600w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":700}}}]},"event_title":"Capstone Celebration","talk_title":null,"talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Workshop"],"start":"2012-12-17T18:00:00.000Z","end":"2012-12-17T20:00:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":null,"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":null,"linked_participant_affiliations":null,"linked_participants":null,"linked_links":null,"linked_research_item":[{"data":{"id":"digital-humanities-incubator-2012-13","title":"Digital Humanities Incubator (2012 – 13)","image":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#486878","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/6887d62091ce0c89abc9118ca5d9138a/e34e2/header_dhincubator..png","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/6887d62091ce0c89abc9118ca5d9138a/d61d9/header_dhincubator..png 350w,\n/mith-static/static/6887d62091ce0c89abc9118ca5d9138a/40d29/header_dhincubator..png 700w,\n/mith-static/static/6887d62091ce0c89abc9118ca5d9138a/e34e2/header_dhincubator..png 1400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/6887d62091ce0c89abc9118ca5d9138a/b6bd0/header_dhincubator..webp 350w,\n/mith-static/static/6887d62091ce0c89abc9118ca5d9138a/c73ac/header_dhincubator..webp 700w,\n/mith-static/static/6887d62091ce0c89abc9118ca5d9138a/b9745/header_dhincubator..webp 1400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":400}}}]}}}],"linked_posts":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["196133661","2857345991"],"slicesMap":{}}
