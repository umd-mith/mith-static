The digital libraries and archives fields have produced high quality repository and collections management software, but these packages carry too much technical overhead and pay too little attention to web presentation and end user interface for most digital humanities projects. Commercial blog packages have made it easy for digital humanists to publish materials to the web, but the blog’s structure of serial text posts does not allow them to present deep collections or complex narratives.\nThat is why the Center for History and New Media (CHNM) at George Mason University, in partnership with the Minnesota Historical Society, has created <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200818093303/http://www.omeka.org/\">Omeka</a>. From the Swahili word meaning “to display” or “to lay out for discussion,” Omeka is a next generation web publishing platform for academic work of all kinds, one that bridges the university, library, and museum worlds through–and by helping to advance–a set of commonly recognized web and metadata standards. Omeka is free and open source. It offers low installation and maintenance costs–appealing to individual scholars and smaller cultural heritage projects and institutions that lack technical staffs and large budgets. It is standards based, extensible, and interoperable–insuring compliance with accessibility guidelines and integration with existing digital collections systems to help digital humanists of all stripes design online exhibitions more efficiently. Omeka brings Web 2.0 technologies and approaches to digital humanities websites–fostering the kind of user interaction and participation that are central to the mission of digital humanities, and providing the contribution mechanisms, tagging facilities, and social networking tools that audiences are coming to expect.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Tom Scheinfeldt, Dave Lester Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Omeka: Easy Web Publishing for Scholarship and Cultural Heritage","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2008-09-30T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2008-09-30T17:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Tom  Scheinfeldt","slug":"tom-scheinfeldt","new_id":544,"group_type":["External"],"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/38a96d6fb3cfbd62b56b939e9332a40e/2d901/Tom%20Scheinfeldt..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/38a96d6fb3cfbd62b56b939e9332a40e/f6d33/Tom%20Scheinfeldt..jpg 95w,\n/mith-static/static/38a96d6fb3cfbd62b56b939e9332a40e/abed7/Tom%20Scheinfeldt..jpg 190w,\n/mith-static/static/38a96d6fb3cfbd62b56b939e9332a40e/2d901/Tom%20Scheinfeldt..jpg 380w","sizes":"(min-width: 380px) 380px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/38a96d6fb3cfbd62b56b939e9332a40e/22533/Tom%20Scheinfeldt..webp 95w,\n/mith-static/static/38a96d6fb3cfbd62b56b939e9332a40e/0504a/Tom%20Scheinfeldt..webp 190w,\n/mith-static/static/38a96d6fb3cfbd62b56b939e9332a40e/8bf11/Tom%20Scheinfeldt..webp 380w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 380px) 380px, 100vw"}]},"width":380,"height":288}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Tom Scheinfeldt is Director-at-Large of the Center for History and New Media and Research Assistant Professor of History in the Department of History and Art History at George Mason University.
