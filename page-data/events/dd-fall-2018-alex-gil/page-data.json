What happens when that talent begins to collaborate across institutions at a massive scale? Or intra-institutionally guided by their own collaborative light outside established and unflinching reward mechanisms? In this presentation, Dr. Alex Gil will argue for a form of rapid organizing for change in non-hierarchical formats that can effectively draw from our collective talent pool in the digital humanities and adjacent formations. Using several specific case studies, including the most recent Torn Apart/Separados effort, the idea of a nimble tent, a mobilized humanities, will emerge as a possible bridge between the long-game of scholarship, and the short-game of political action in the now.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Alex Gil Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Nimble Tents","talk_subtitle":"xpmethod, #tornapart, and Other Tensile Approaches to the Fourth Estate","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2018-11-06T17:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Alex  Gil","slug":"alex-gil","new_id":372,"group_type":["External"],"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#282828","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/387bb3227edd1bcb31d5dc1dbd8dbcbb/40f9a/alex_headshot..png","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/387bb3227edd1bcb31d5dc1dbd8dbcbb/157e7/alex_headshot..png 181w,\n/mith-static/static/387bb3227edd1bcb31d5dc1dbd8dbcbb/3992f/alex_headshot..png 363w,\n/mith-static/static/387bb3227edd1bcb31d5dc1dbd8dbcbb/40f9a/alex_headshot..png 725w","sizes":"(min-width: 725px) 725px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/387bb3227edd1bcb31d5dc1dbd8dbcbb/a275e/alex_headshot..webp 181w,\n/mith-static/static/387bb3227edd1bcb31d5dc1dbd8dbcbb/aecfe/alex_headshot..webp 363w,\n/mith-static/static/387bb3227edd1bcb31d5dc1dbd8dbcbb/1179f/alex_headshot..webp 725w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 725px) 725px, 100vw"}]},"width":725,"height":729}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"alex-gil","slug":"alex-gil"}}],"department":"Humanities and History Division","institution":"Columbia University Libraries","title":"Digital Scholarship Coordinator"}}]}}],"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"alex-gil","slug":"alex-gil"}}],"department":"Humanities and History Division","institution":"Columbia University Libraries","title":"Digital Scholarship Coordinator"}}],"linked_participant_affiliations":null,"linked_participants":null,"linked_links":null,"linked_research_item":[{"data":{"id":"mith-digital-dialogues","title":"Digital Dialogues","image":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/e34e2/header_digital-dialogues..png","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/d61d9/header_digital-dialogues..png 350w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/40d29/header_digital-dialogues..png 700w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/e34e2/header_digital-dialogues..png 1400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/b6bd0/header_digital-dialogues..webp 350w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/c73ac/header_digital-dialogues..webp 700w,\n/mith-static/static/3e409eafb77e1418d1cf388a46db7c6c/b9745/header_digital-dialogues..webp 1400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":400}}}]}}}],"linked_posts":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
