Unfortunately, as paper is a static media, this web often gets trapped in the physical world.\nTo address these limitations, we propose PapierCraft, a gesture-based interface that allows users to manipulate digital documents directly using their printouts as proxies. Using a digital pen, users can annotate a printout or draw command gestures to indicate operations such as copying a document area, pasting an area previously copied, or creating a link. Upon pen synchronization, our infrastructure executes these commands and presents the result in a customized viewer. In this talk I will describe the design and implementation of the PapierCraft command system, and report on early user feedback.</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Chunyuan Liao Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"PapierCraft","talk_subtitle":"A Command System for Interactive Paper","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2005-10-18T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2005-10-18T17:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"name":"Chunyuan Liao","affiliations":[{"title":"Doctoral candidate","department":"Computer Science and Human-Computer Interaction Lab","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"person_group":null,"slug":"chunyuan-liao","new_id":409,"headshot":null}],"participants":[],"links":[],"sponsors":[],"partners":[],"research":[{"id":"mith-digital-dialogues","title":"Digital Dialogues","image":[{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v2/22/22/1700092800000/ETgCHh10ipX-pfzAuL2a4w/c8Tb8qufApHPOoBYJtOFNFEuDv0mxiMC1DE7SeZkc_cnJZgGC_0yxRLBD3j0UoZYrDrTGxgyqBSjm4GUnamoLsF1hxVgerbxsPqxPF2uyaaafkhnlfJ4WjGOSfqUull7B8A_5R4G-b_UpaFiYcRQ4Vjg2T_a_1OeQuL3RfMaOok/jtADp_yL0i2CPgtArFiIFY-RAksb1F3VrXBqJBCK9gM"}]}],"posts":[],"disciplines":[],"methods":[]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
