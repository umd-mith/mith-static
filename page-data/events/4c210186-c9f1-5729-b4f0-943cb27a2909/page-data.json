Featured keynote speakers included Patricia Fumerton (University of California, Santa Barbara), Whitney Trettien (University of Pennsylvania), and Amanda Eubanks Winkler (Syracuse University). The conference also included an introductory digital humanities workshop on TEI/MEI and a public recital of songs featuring selections from Henry Lawes’s <em>Ayres and Dialogues</em> (1653), performed by Rebecca Claborn (mezzo-soprano), Lawrence Wiliford (tenor), and Lucas Harris (lute). \nVideo recordings of the three plenary sessions can be accessed below. Audio recordings of the recital performances are also available below through the link to the full conference archive that has been preserved in the EMS repository.</p>"}},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/644137f14b0bea5fca0ad3b87514a460/716c3/O4c8d5JXZ4CUTrd-YtU1VmVAIFzNW071U1ykUnJHtyU.png","srcSet":"/static/644137f14b0bea5fca0ad3b87514a460/e1907/O4c8d5JXZ4CUTrd-YtU1VmVAIFzNW071U1ykUnJHtyU.png 150w,\n/static/644137f14b0bea5fca0ad3b87514a460/0ca00/O4c8d5JXZ4CUTrd-YtU1VmVAIFzNW071U1ykUnJHtyU.png 300w,\n/static/644137f14b0bea5fca0ad3b87514a460/716c3/O4c8d5JXZ4CUTrd-YtU1VmVAIFzNW071U1ykUnJHtyU.png 600w","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/644137f14b0bea5fca0ad3b87514a460/b41db/O4c8d5JXZ4CUTrd-YtU1VmVAIFzNW071U1ykUnJHtyU.webp 150w,\n/static/644137f14b0bea5fca0ad3b87514a460/9d5e2/O4c8d5JXZ4CUTrd-YtU1VmVAIFzNW071U1ykUnJHtyU.webp 300w,\n/static/644137f14b0bea5fca0ad3b87514a460/9a4d4/O4c8d5JXZ4CUTrd-YtU1VmVAIFzNW071U1ykUnJHtyU.webp 600w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 600px) 600px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":700}}}},"event_title":"Early Modern Songscapes","talk_title":null,"talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Conference"],"start":"2019-02-08T05:00:00.000Z","end":"2019-02-09T05:00:00.000Z","location":"Victoria College, University of Toronto","speakers":[{"name":"Patricia Fumerton","affiliations":[{"title":null,"department":null,"institution":"University of California, Santa Barbara"}],"person_group":null,"slug":"patricia-fumerton","new_id":621},{"name":"Amanda Eubanks Winkler","affiliations":[{"title":null,"department":null,"institution":"Syracuse University"}],"person_group":null,"slug":"amanda-eubanks-winkler","new_id":622},{"name":"Whitney Trettien","affiliations":[{"title":null,"department":null,"institution":"University of Pennsylvania"}],"person_group":null,"slug":"whitney-trettien","new_id":623}],"participants":[],"links":[{"title":"About the Conference","url":"http://ems.digitalscholarship.utsc.utoronto.ca/content/about-conference","type":"url"},{"title":"Early Modern Songscapes Conference Program","url":"http://ems.digitalscholarship.utsc.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/ems:470","type":"url"},{"title":"Voices in the Ayre: Early Modern Songscapes and the Music of Henry Lawes (Recital Programme)","url":"https://ems.digitalscholarship.utsc.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/ems:471","type":"url"},{"title":"Fumerton Plenary - \"Ballading The Winter's Tale\"","url":"http://ems.digitalscholarship.utsc.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/ems%3A592","type":"url"},{"title":"Eubanks Winkler Plenary - \"Minding the Gaps: Performance, Embodiment, and the Archive\"","url":"https://ems.digitalscholarship.utsc.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/ems%3A591","type":"url"},{"title":"Trettien Plenary - \"Embodied Book History: The Case of Benlowes' Theophilia\"","url":"https://ems.digitalscholarship.utsc.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/ems%3A593","type":"url"},{"title":"Conference Website Archive","url":"https://ems.digitalscholarship.utsc.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/ems%3Aconference","type":"url"}],"sponsors":[{"name":"Centre for Renaissance and Reformation Studies","website":"https://crrs.ca","type":"External","slug":"crrs"},{"name":"University of Toronto Scarborough","website":"https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca","type":"External","slug":"utoronto_utsc"},{"name":"Jackman Humanities Institute","website":"https://humanities.utoronto.ca","type":"External","slug":"utoronto_jhi"},{"name":"University of South Carolina","website":null,"type":"External","slug":"usc"},{"name":"University of  St. Michael’s College","website":"https://stmikes.utoronto.ca","type":"External","slug":"utoronto_stmikes"},{"name":"The Toronto Renaissance and Reformation Colloquium","website":"https://trrc.itergateway.org","type":"External","slug":"trrc"},{"name":"Department of English","website":null,"type":"Internal","slug":"dept_eng"}],"partners":[],"research":[{"id":"early-modern-soundscapes","title":"Early Modern Soundscapes","image":[{"url":"https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v2/22/22/1700092800000/C-42mNOpZY2rUevjpWgD7g/Ms3JXx1GUYerPTze_eLXsUSe0maeBh767mpFKxLpjxCIXA15e-mLE8m7ElnBeb9XEmgq7TPebe55RPl7_izEa9qovCbP-aixOTAsMBopiZHDJyL27972V0lMjABvAr_80lXpMcf7rhl6fb_T5FdYdA/S6O-7XBt7C1B_NFJTsuV1MaT65MrCBEv6TjE9lQXPA4"}]}],"posts":[],"disciplines":[],"methods":[]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
