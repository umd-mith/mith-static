Using project case studies from a decade of experience in this field, the presentation brings to the fore the ways in which these technologies both enforce and challenge traditional ideas of what a museum is or should be. The paper examines the evolution of simple virtual representation to modeled reconstruction and deconstruction and thence to virtual replacement of artifacts in situ at their point of creation or discovery. The presentation concludes with a look forward to the concept of massively multi-user virtual community spaces that permit a participatory experience of virtual cultural heritage.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"John Tolva Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Architecting Cultural Spaces","talk_subtitle":"Case Studies of Virtual Representation in the Humanities","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2007-09-25T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2007-09-25T17:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"John  Tolva","slug":"john-tolva","new_id":461,"group_type":["External"],"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/49027a8f81b67bdce1cba80221f16480/65320/John-Tolva..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/49027a8f81b67bdce1cba80221f16480/ab3c3/John-Tolva..jpg 168w,\n/mith-static/static/49027a8f81b67bdce1cba80221f16480/976e1/John-Tolva..jpg 335w,\n/mith-static/static/49027a8f81b67bdce1cba80221f16480/65320/John-Tolva..jpg 670w","sizes":"(min-width: 670px) 670px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/49027a8f81b67bdce1cba80221f16480/1b959/John-Tolva..webp 168w,\n/mith-static/static/49027a8f81b67bdce1cba80221f16480/ba703/John-Tolva..webp 335w,\n/mith-static/static/49027a8f81b67bdce1cba80221f16480/20392/John-Tolva..webp 670w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 670px) 670px, 100vw"}]},"width":670,"height":446.00000000000006}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Tolva is the Senior Program Manager at IBM at their Chicago Innovation Center, where he leads up various initiatives including one which advises cities how to incorporate data analytics into planning and operations.
