Velazquez’s examines three areas, the Go Mamasita! Dance Studio, a site envisioned as a place where women of color, particularly African-American women, can reconnect with dance ancestry, a nexus to North African dance traditions, filtered through the lens of digital diaspora; <em>Red Light Center (RLC)</em>, an adults-only virtual world, similar in design to _World of Warcraft _or _SecondLife, _to discuss the role pre-structuring technology takes in creating erotic virtual cityscapes; and the blogosphere, particularly blogs that grapple with anti-racist discourse, fandom, and popular culture. Through an investigation of these spaces, Velazquez describes the ways individuals engage in virtual and “real-world” activism. Actions and behaviors that highlight the ways in which the language of friendship, holism, and community is mobilized in conversations about citizenship, the body, and desire. While a dance studio, a pornographic virtual world, and segments of the blogosphere may seem like a disparate collection of sites for investigation, all three share an abiding interest in the body and its potential as site of pleasure.</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Maria Velazquez Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Communities Incarnate","talk_subtitle":"Virtual Intimacies of Body and Place","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2011-04-12T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2011-04-12T17:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"name":"Maria Velazquez","affiliations":[{"title":"Winnemore Digital Humanities Dissertation Fellow","department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"person_group":null,"slug":"maria-velazquez","new_id":150,"headshot":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/9b71e06228e6471ea50ce6441c34e657/78b30/CSnZO3z3EBbpRPJI-217KuH0r17EzOAsC5XkzVxNrsU.png","srcSet":"/static/9b71e06228e6471ea50ce6441c34e657/3f1f8/CSnZO3z3EBbpRPJI-217KuH0r17EzOAsC5XkzVxNrsU.png 31w,\n/static/9b71e06228e6471ea50ce6441c34e657/d6409/CSnZO3z3EBbpRPJI-217KuH0r17EzOAsC5XkzVxNrsU.png 61w,\n/static/9b71e06228e6471ea50ce6441c34e657/78b30/CSnZO3z3EBbpRPJI-217KuH0r17EzOAsC5XkzVxNrsU.png 122w","sizes":"(min-width: 122px) 122px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/9b71e06228e6471ea50ce6441c34e657/5a608/CSnZO3z3EBbpRPJI-217KuH0r17EzOAsC5XkzVxNrsU.webp 31w,\n/static/9b71e06228e6471ea50ce6441c34e657/cc478/CSnZO3z3EBbpRPJI-217KuH0r17EzOAsC5XkzVxNrsU.webp 61w,\n/static/9b71e06228e6471ea50ce6441c34e657/c3aab/CSnZO3z3EBbpRPJI-217KuH0r17EzOAsC5XkzVxNrsU.webp 122w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 122px) 122px, 100vw"}]},"width":122,"height":205}}},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Maria Velazquez is a doctoral student at the University of Maryland (College Park, Md.) in American Studies, and MITH Winnemore Dissertation Fellow.
