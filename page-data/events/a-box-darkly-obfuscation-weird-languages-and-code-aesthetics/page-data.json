This talk explores programming practices in which other values are at work, showing that the aesthetics of code must be enlarged to accommodate them. The two practices considered are obfuscated programming and the creation of \"weird languages\" for coding. Connections between these two practices, and between these and other mechanical and literary aesthetic traditions, are discussed. (This is a presentation of joint work with Michael Mateas.)</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Nick Montfort Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"A Box, Darkly: Obfuscation, Weird Languages, and Code Aesthetics","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2005-11-15T17:30:00.000Z","end":"2005-11-15T18:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Nick Montfort","slug":"nick-montfort","new_id":509,"group_type":["External"],"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Nick Montfort is a doctoral candidate in computer science at the University of Pennsylvania.
