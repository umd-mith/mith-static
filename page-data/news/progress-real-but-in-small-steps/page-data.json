It’s for a Festschrift, and I’ve been asked not to state the venue openly, but can share a draft.</li>\n<li>Thought a lot about (and only partly understand) multivariate statistics.</li>\n<li>Completed the first round of markup for all the Genizah fragments for my sample chapter. A second round of markup linking the fragments to the reference text needs to be done (next bullet). Formatted versions of these texts will be viewable</li>\n<li>Started rethinking how to handle the encoding of highly fragmentary texts. In particular, I’ve found four pieces of a single sheet of text in two different locations in the Taylor-Schechter collection (TS AS 78.69 + TS AS 78.162 + TS AS 78.235 + TS NS 329.286; the sheet adjoins another single sheet from a third box, TS E2.71). For the present, we are encoding each fragment as a document, and recording the extent of the lacunae at the edges of the fragment as fitting within the smallest properly oriented rectangle that encloses the fragment. What needs doing is a pointing scheme that will point into the reference text.</li>\n<li>Identified the next fragments to work on to expand the work to Tractate <em>Neziqin</em> (aka the <em>Bavot</em>), and started to recruit people to work on it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Next up, completing fragmentary texts; encoding the remaining Mishnah texts in the Babylonian Talmud mss., and learning some Java.</p>\n<p><em>Hayim Lapin is Robert H.
