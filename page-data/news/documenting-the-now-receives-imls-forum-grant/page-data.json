Through Webrecorder, Rhizome aims to support decentralized, specialized born-digital archives that center the interests of the users and communities they serve.</p>\n<p>Archiving social media has been a key concern of the Webrecorder initiative, and the National Forum builds on a successful series of 'Digital Social Memory' events which addressed the topic. <a href=\"https://livestream.com/newmuseum/events/4837386\">Both</a> <a href=\"http://rhizome.org/editorial/2017/mar/13/watch-digital-social-memory/\">iterations</a> of DSM have brought together artists, activists, and archivists to talk about social media as cultural practice, and how it is and will be remembered.
