We're delighted to be expanding the model pioneered by the highly-successful Digital Humanities Summer Institute (<a href=\"http://www.dhsi.org\">DHSI</a>) at the University of Victoria to the United States.</p>\n<p>DHWI will provide an opportunity for scholars to learn new skills relevant to different kinds of digital scholarship while mingling with like-minded colleagues in coursework, social events, and lectures during an intensive, week-long event located amid the many attractions of the Washington, D.C. region.</p>\n<p>Courses are open to all skill levels and will cater to many different interests. For the 2013 Institute we've assembled <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/dhwi/?q=node/25\">an amazing group of instructors</a> who will teach everything from introductory courses on project development and programming, to intermediate level courses on image analysis, teaching with multimedia, and data curation. DHWI will also feature more technically-advanced courses on text analysis and linked open data. We hope that <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/dhwi/?q=courses\">the curricula</a> we've assembled will appeal to graduate students, faculty, librarians, and museum professionals as well as participants from government and non-governmental organizations.</p>\n<p>An exciting program of <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/dhwi/?q=dhwi_public_dh\">extracurricular events</a> will accompany the formal DHWI courses to capitalize on the Institute's proximity to the many cultural heritage organizations in the region. This stream of activities, which we're calling \"DHWI Public Digital Humanities,\" will include an API workshop, a hack-a-thon, and opportunities to contribute videos and other materials to the <a href=\"http://humanistica.ualberta.ca/\">4Humanities</a> campaign to document the importance of the humanities for contemporary society.</p>\n<p>Both the outward-looking DHWI Public Digital Humanities program and the week of high-caliber, in-depth digital humanities coursework will be kicked off by <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/dhwi/?q=keynote\">the Institute Lecture</a>. This year's speaker will be Seb Chan, currently the Director of Digital &#x26; Emerging Media at the Smithsonian, Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum in New York City.</p>\n<p>We hope that many of you will join us this winter in Maryland for what promises to be a terrific event. Registration is now available at <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/dhwi/?q=registration\">this site</a>.</p>\n<p>Like DHSI, we will be offering a limited number of <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/dhwi/?q=scholarships\">sponsored student scholarships</a> to help cover the cost of attending the Institute. The scholarships are made possible through the generosity of this year's DHWI Instructors and the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities</p>\n<p>To keep up with news and events related to DHWI, follow @dhwi_mith.
