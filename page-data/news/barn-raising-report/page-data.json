As previously reported, the group (participants listed in the early blog entry <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/mith-barn-raising-continues/\">here</a>) split into two teams: one working to extend the tei-ann plugin for CKEditor (<a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/teiann/\">http://sourceforge.net/projects/teiann/</a>) to allow for TEI-lite annotations, and one building an XML source editor with color coding and code suggestion. The first team produced a preliminary stakeholders document which is currently being used by the designers of the original plugin to create a roadmap for future development. The second team has produced a working prototype of their source editor, <em>Angles</em>, which can be tested <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20111121222306/http://mith.umd.edu/staff/dreside/RaiseXML/\">here</a> and downloaded from <a href=\"https://github.com/dougreside/RaiseXML\">here</a>. At present none of the menu options (file, edit, help) on <em>Angles</em> have been activated, but typing an angle bracket (&#x3C;) in the text area will activate the autocomplete feature to suggest possible tags for that location. If you're interested in joining either effort, email us at mith (</p>"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
