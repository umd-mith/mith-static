There will be two speakers associated with this event, coming to campus on separate days. All events are free and open to the public.</p>\n<p>The first will be on Monday, April 17th. SHELLEY JACKSON will present \"Shelley Jackson's Interstitial Library\" at 3:30 in Susquehanna Hall 1120. There will also be a more casual colloquium discussion at MITH (McKeldin Library, B0131) earlier in the day at 11:00, which all are welcome to attend. Jackson is an internationally recognized writer, electronic artist, and theorist and practitioner of new performance media. Her work includes <em><a href=\"http://www.eastgate.com/catalog/PatchworkGirl.html\">Patchwork Girl</a></em> (published in 1995 by Eastgate Systems, it is a hypertext refashioning of <em>Frankenstein</em>, told--in part--from the vantage point of the female monster). \"Perhaps the true paradigmatic work of the era,\" writes Robert Coover, \"Shelley Jackson's elegantly designed, beautifully composed <em>Patchwork Girl</em> offers the patient reader, if there are any left in the world, just such an experience of losing oneself to a text, for as one plunges deeper and deeper into one's own personal exploration of the relations here of creator to created and of body to text, one never fails to be rewarded and so is drawn ever deeper, until clicking the mouse is as unconscious an act as turning a page, and much less constraining, more compelling.\" More recently, Jackson has gained notoriety for \"<a href=\"http://ineradicablestain.com/skin.html\">Skin</a>,\" a short story \"published\" as individual words tattooed onto the skin of hundreds of willing participants. She has written experimental Web-based texts, including \"My Body--a Wunderkammer\" (available at <a href=\"http://www.altx.com/thebody/\">http://www.altx.com/thebody/</a>) and \"Stitch Bitch\" (<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20161028054228/http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/papers/jackson.html\">http://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/papers/jackson.html</a>). She is also an illustrator of children's books. Jackson teaches at the New School.</p>\n<p>SCOTT McCLOUD will visit on Tuesday, May 2.
