A capstone for this process, our 2 ½ day event will bring together 50 scholars and practitioners from several disciplines, spanning the humanities, sciences, and social sciences, as well as representatives from 10 funding agencies.</p>\n<p>Through a mix of formal and informal presentations combined with facilitated breakout sessions, we will focus on questions concerning how researchers and institutions might best leverage crowdsourcing strategies for increasing public engagement, integrating data into existing collections, and improving knowledge production in a variety of domains.</p>\n<p>If you believe that you could make an important contribution to this conversation, please do apply for one of the 15 open slots in the workshop by filling out the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/14HASCdLPi_1raUyg70iZE31aiMxb5Vu4qHXe_DTjFnI/viewform\">online application form</a> and following the accompanying instructions. <strong>Applications are due by Monday, March 2</strong>; decisions will be made by Monday, March 16.
