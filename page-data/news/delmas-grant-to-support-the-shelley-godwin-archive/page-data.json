This single family--Mary Shelley was the daughter of Godwin and Wollstonecraft, and the wife of Percy Bysshe--embodies an archetype of British Romanticism: all four struggled in their writings and lives to change the world. Their most important works--Wollstonecraft’s <em>Vindication of the Rights of Woman</em>, Godwin’s <em>Enquiry Concerning Political Justice</em>, P.B. Shelley’s <em>Queen Mab</em>, and <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>, and Mary Shelley’s <em>Frankenstein</em>--received very different degrees of acclaim in their authors’ lifetimes. All, however, have had lasting and profound effects on international culture.</p>\n<p>MITH is partnering in this work with the <a href=\"http://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/\">Bodleian Libraries</a> of University of Oxford, the <a href=\"http://www.huntington.org/\">Huntington Library</a>, the <a href=\"http://hcl.harvard.edu/libraries/houghton/\">Houghton Library</a> of Harvard College, the <a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/\">British Library</a>, and the Carl H. Pforzheimer Collection of Shelley and His Circle at the <a href=\"http://www.nypl.org/\">New York Public Library</a>, which together hold more than an estimated 90% of the known manuscripts. The project aims to create an innovative archival framework constituting a new model of best practices for research libraries wishing to make freely available to the public their manuscript and print holdings. During the three-year initial phase of the project, the project will be including the nearly thirty known Percy Shelley notebooks and his major philosophical poem, <em>Queen Mab</em>, with his extensive reworking; all of the manuscripts for and the first three editions of Mary Shelley’s <em>Frankenstein</em>, along with the first two volumes of Mary Shelley’s journals; the manuscripts of two novels by William Godwin, <em>Fleetwood</em> and <em>Cloudesley</em>; and the ten volumes of <em>Shelley and his Circle</em> with their invaluable research and all the manuscripts contained in those volumes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.delmas.org/\">The Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation</a> will be supporting the work of a team of encoding specialists to begin work on the<em> Shelley-Godwin Archive _materials beginning in January 2012. On behalf of the</em> Shelley-Godwin Archive_ partners, MITH would like to thank the Delmas Foundation for their generous support.</p>\n<p>Visit the <em>Shelley-Godwin Archive</em> at <a href=\"http://www.shelleygodwinarchive.org/\">www.shelleygodwinarchive.org</a>, or follow on Twitter <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/shelleygodwin\">@shelleygodwin</a>.</p>"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"]}
