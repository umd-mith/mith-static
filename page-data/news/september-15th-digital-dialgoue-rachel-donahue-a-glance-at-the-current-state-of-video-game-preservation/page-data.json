Understanding what the videogame industry itself is doing with the concept art, tools, and other records they create is an important step to ensure that these increasingly important artifacts are preserved for future generations. In this talk Donahue will discuss findings from her preliminary survey of videogame industry (and player community) preservation and records management practices.</p>\n<p>RACHEL DONAHUE is a doctoral student at the University of Maryland's iSchool, researching the preservation of complex, interactive digital objects.
