My course, which I'm co-teaching with <a href=\"http://library.duke.edu/apps/directory/staff/5401/\">Naomi Nelson</a> (Director of Special Collections at Duke) is on Born-Digital Materials. That may sound strange, but RBS has had the vision to recognize that the same intimate knowledge of the materiality of books and printed matter we associate with the School's mission is also essential to the digital artifacts of the computer age. My teaching at RBS is a fantastic opportunity to influence the cultural heritage professionals who are charged with preserving this material for future generations, and builds naturally on our work at MITH on the <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/research/deena-larsen-collection/\">Deena Larsen Collection</a> and the <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/research/pvwi/\">Preserving Virtual Worlds</a> project, among others.</p>","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/mith-static/mith-static/src/news/born-digital-materials-at-uvas-rare-book-school.md"}},"staticQueryHashes":["196133661","2857345991"],"slicesMap":{}}
