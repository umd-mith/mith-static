During the last years this collection, currently spread-out in about 60 libraries in Europe, North America and Israel, has been digitized by the Friedberg Genizah Project almost in full, producing some 450,000 digital images. The lecture will introduce this collection and will present some of the modules and tools that have been developed for automatically extracting data from the digital images, joining the dispersed fragments, and locating fragments by a specific handwriting.</p>\n<p>Dr. Roni Shweka (PhD, Rabbinic Literature, Hebrew University, 2009) is currently a Harry Starr Fellow in the Center for Jewish Studies at Harvard University. His main fields are Jewish law in the Geonic period (8th-11th centuries) and the research of the Cairo Genizah. He is an Academic Advisor in Genazim: The Friedberg Genizah Project Computerization Unit.</p>\n<p>For more information, visit the <a href=\"http://www.jewishstudies.umd.edu\">Meyerhoff Center for Jewish Studies website,</a> or <a href=\"mailto:dakirsch@umd.edu\">email Debra Kirsch</a>.</p>"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
