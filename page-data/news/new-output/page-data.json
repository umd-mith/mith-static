Some of the output problems are the result of tokenizing (the samples used were tokenized very coarsely) and can be fixed. Abbreviations and the phenomenon of connected or unconnected prepositions (של, also words such as כיצד) can also be fixed. But some errors have to do with how CollateX deals with edit distance. Not sure how we are going to handle this.</p>\n<p><em>Hayim Lapin is Robert H. Smith Professor of Jewish Studies and Professor in the Department of History at the University of Maryland.
