MEI to VexFlow is a JavaScript program that interfaces with VexFlow to render music notation expressed in the MEI format. The Music Encoding Initiative (MEI) is a community-driven effort to create a commonly-accepted, digital, symbolic representation of music notation documents. My goal is to boost the MEI to VexFlow library's capabilities in order to support MEI variant handling. Variant handling in music editing is a substantial problem for the digital editing, musicological and performing musician community.</p>\n<p>Being a classical musician, recently graduated (Bachelor of Music) and currently part-time student at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, and also a software engineer, I am now trying to combine my expertise in these two areas. My primary field of interest within the intersection of music and computing is notation and digital publishing, especially from the performing musician's point-of-view. I have long been interested in the way we will use digital sheet music in the future with special regards to today's trends in music editing and publication; now my aim is to make an impact on the development of the related technologies.</p>\n<p>I feel honoured to be accepted at the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) that allows me to join the MITH for the summer months, and I am very much looking forward to work with my mentor at MITH, <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/people/person/raffaele-viglianti/\" title=\"Raffaele Viglianti\">Raffaele Viglianti</a>, who regularly contributes to MEI-to-VexFlow and is a respected member of the MEI community. I have big hopes for learning a lot from him and from other team members at the MITH, and also I would like to take the opportunity for paving the way for future projects and development in this area.</p>","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/mith-static/mith-static/src/news/mei-to-vexflow.md"}},"staticQueryHashes":["196133661","2857345991"],"slicesMap":{}}
