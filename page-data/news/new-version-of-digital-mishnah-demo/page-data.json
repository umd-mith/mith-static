Much of the change is in styling and branding, but there are new texts added, some new views, and a new naming convention.</p>\n<p><em><strong>New</strong></em>** <em>texts.</em>** Gradually, I am replacing the sample files with just <em>Bava Metsi’a</em> Ch. 2 with transcriptions covering all of tractate Neziqin (the Bavot). Currently, this applies to the Maimonides autograph, Paris BNF Héb. 328-329, and the Naples <em>editio princeps</em> (with the marginalia from the copy in the National Library of Israel.) Work is ongoing on other witnesses. Some new Genizah fragments have been added, and, in the next release, I hope to be able to show some samples of virtually joined manuscripts that can be broken out into the individual fragments.</p>\n<p><em><strong>New views**</strong>.**</em> Users can now browse through documents page by page or column by column, and they can see witnesses chunked by chapter in a compact view.</p>\n<p><em><strong>New naming convention.</strong></em> Sigla for the manuscripts will now be based on the recent <em>Thesaurus of Talmudic Manuscripts</em>. Print editions will be based on serial numbers in similar format. We are experimenting with a convention for sigla that is slightly more informative, so that it will be possible to tell that a given witness includes the Mishnah alone, or a commentary in Hebrew or Arabic, and perhaps other data such as region and date of hand. (This last will require expert typing of the manuscripts.)</p>\n<p><em>Hayim Lapin is Robert H.
