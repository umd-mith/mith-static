Join us for a working meeting on regional DHcollaborations hosted by the Scholars’ Lab at the University of Virginia, March 9th.</p>\n<p>The symposium aims to gather a diverse group of voices who are working in these areas to foster dialogue and connections. Sessions will focus on: supporting digital work by students, pedagogy, social justice, and facilitating regional collaboration. Conversations between small groups from four institutions (MITH, Scholars’ Lab, Washington &#x26; Lee, and the University of Richmond) suggested a shared desire for greater collaboration and exchange. The aspiration for this meeting is to get people together to share strategies, concerns, as well as seed ideas for future collaborations with the ultimate goal of fostering a larger network of collaborators across the Virginia, D.C., Maryland region.</p>\n<p>The Regional DH Symposium website may be found at<a href=\"http://symposium.scholarslab.org/\"> http://symposium.scholarslab.org/</a> and the schedule at:<a href=\"http://symposium.scholarslab.org/schedule/\"> http://symposium.scholarslab.org/schedule/.
