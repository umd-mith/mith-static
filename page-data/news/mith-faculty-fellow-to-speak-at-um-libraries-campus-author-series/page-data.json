Throughout the course of the year, Dr. Peterson is giving book talks across the country. A complete calendar of her events is listed on the <a href=\"http://www.blackgothamarchive.org/\">Archive</a>.</p>\n<p>The <em>Speaking of Books... Conversations with Campus Authors</em> series of author talks and signings was begun in 2005 by the University of Maryland Libraries' Humanities Librarians to highlight new and interesting research by faculty members from all schools and colleges at the University of Maryland. These free events are open to all members of the campus community and the general public. Each author will answer questions following his or her talk and sign books, which will be available for purchase. Refreshments will be served.</p>","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/mith-static/mith-static/src/news/mith-faculty-fellow-to-speak-at-um-libraries-campus-author-series.md"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
