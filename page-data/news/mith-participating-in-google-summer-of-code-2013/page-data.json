Google works with many open source, free software, and technology-related groups to identify and fund projects over a three month period. Since its inception in 2005, the program has brought together nearly six thousand successful student participants and over three thousand mentors from over a hundred countries worldwide, all for the love of code.</p>\n<p>Through Google Summer of Code, accepted student applicants are paired with a mentor or mentors from the participating projects, thus gaining exposure to real-world software development scenarios and the opportunity for employment in areas related to their academic pursuits. In turn, the participating projects are able to more easily identify and bring in new developers. Best of all, more source code is created and released for the use and benefit of all.</p>\n<p>To learn more about the program, read the 2013 <a href=\"http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2013/help_page\">Frequently Asked Questions</a> page.</p>","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/mith-static/mith-static/src/news/mith-participating-in-google-summer-of-code-2013.md"}},"staticQueryHashes":["196133661","2857345991"],"slicesMap":{}}
