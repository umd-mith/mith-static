The immediate matter was to review the <em>DLC</em> in fulfillment of an assignment for the Digital Humanities course, taught by <a href=\"http://www.lis.illinois.edu/\">GSLIS</a> Dean <a href=\"http://www.lis.illinois.edu/people/faculty/unsworth\">John Unsworth</a>. Further, I was curious to see if the DLC housed changing versions, programming notes, original image files, etc. for Deena Larsen’s important—and unreleased—hypertext work, <em>Marble Springs, Second Edition</em> which is the focus for my Master’s Thesis, guided by Prof <a href=\"http://www.lis.illinois.edu/people/faculty/jmcdonou\">Jerry McDonough</a>. (I was not disappointed!)</p>\n<p><a href=\"../images/2014-02-MS2_001.jpg\"><img src=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/MS2_001.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"MarbleSprings_2\"></a></p>\n<!-- @font-face {   font-family: \"Cambria\"; }p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal { margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; font-size: 12pt; font-family: Cambria; }div.Section1 { page: Section1; } -->\n<p>(A brief aside: The <em>DLC</em> website on <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/larsen/about/marblesprings\"><em>Marble Springs</em></a> focuses on <em>Marble Springs, First Edition</em>, produced in Apple’s <em>HyperCard</em> software and published by Eastgate Systems in 1993. <em>Marble Springs, Second Edition</em>—expanded with new content added by Deena and contributed by a dozen additional authors—was prepared for publication in 1997 by Deena and programmer Carlos Boutran.</p>\n<p>Sadly, <em>MS2</em> was not released, although <em>MS1</em> is <a href=\"http://www.eastgate.com/catalog/MarbleSprings.html\">still available</a> from Eastgate.)</p>\n<p>I spent two days at MITH, exploring the <em>DLC</em>, talking with the <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/people\">MITH staff</a> (a shout of thanks to Director Neil Fraistat, Dave Lester, Seth Denbo, Christina Grogan, James Neal, and Alex Quinn) and interviewing Associate Director Matthew Kirschenbaum. Everyone made me welcome. And as I was the first external researcher to utilize <em>The Deena Larsen Collection</em>, I felt like a bit of a celebrity: Matt even Tweeted about my visit.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/DLC_tweet.jpg\"><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 225px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 163.5%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"2014 02 DLC tweet sm\"\n        title=\"DLC_Tweet\"\n        src=\"/mith-static/static/9f04aaf9acd6b9183f634ba3ed6517d6/863e1/2014-02-DLC_tweet_sm.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/mith-static/static/9f04aaf9acd6b9183f634ba3ed6517d6/e07e9/2014-02-DLC_tweet_sm.jpg 200w,\n/mith-static/static/9f04aaf9acd6b9183f634ba3ed6517d6/863e1/2014-02-DLC_tweet_sm.jpg 225w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span></a></p>\n<p>At right, I am exploring the box with the paper version of <em>Marble Springs</em>; Deena’s 1992 Master’s Thesis, <em>Hyperpoems and Hyperpossibilites</em>, and other analog treasures.</p>\n<p>While talking about the <em>DLC</em> with Neil, he was nice enough to invite me to post to the <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/blog/\">MITH blog</a> about my experience at MITH.
