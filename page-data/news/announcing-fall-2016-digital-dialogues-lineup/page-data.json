Our <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/digital-dialogues/schedule/\">Fall 2016 series</a> starts off strong with talks from our two newest hires, Assistant Director of Innovation and Learning <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/people/person/purdom-lindblad/\">Purdom Lindblad</a>, and Director of the <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/research/synergies-among-digital-humanities-and-african-american-history-and-culture/\">AADHum project</a> <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/people/person/catherine-knight-steele/\">Catherine Steele</a>. Then we will bring you five additional speakers from disciplines ranging from Film and Media, African American Studies and Literature, Medieval Conservation, and Museums and Material Culture.</p>\n<p>To kick things off, we are holding our third annual Pre-Season Mixer on <strong>Tuesday September 27th at 12:30pm</strong>. We've held these mixers each year since 2014 to allow new students, faculty and members of the campus community to come meet MITH staff and our community of Digital Dialogues attendees, hear about the series, and get acquainted with what MITH does. We also want to hear about you - your research interests, your current projects (and dream project) in the digital scholarly humanities, and more. Attendees will be given the opportunity to give a 3-5 minute lightning talk to spark a discussion. Stay tuned for more information!</p>\n<p>This season, four of our talks are being presented in conjunction with our Mellon-funded initiative, Synergies among Digital Humanities and African American History and Culture (AADHum): Catherine Steele, Ravon Ruffin, Sarah Patterson/Jim Casey, and Dana Williams/Kenton Rambsy.
