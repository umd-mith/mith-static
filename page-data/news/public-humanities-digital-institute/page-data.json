The LCHP will be one of several case studies used by Institute instructors to highlight a range of platforms and modes of digital scholarship, to provide participants with real-world examples.</p>\n<p>There are also two upcoming virtual information sessions tomorrow (Thursday December 2) and Friday December 17 where potential applicants can ask questions or talk in person with select Institute staff. <a href=\"https://publicdh.org/info-sessions/\">Interested applicants can register here</a>.</p>\n<p>Included below is a brief synopsis of the Institute for reference.
