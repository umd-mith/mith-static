The focus of THATCamp Games is \"hack over yack\" (!); we hope you'll leave the unconference knowing how to do something new. To ensure that happens, we encourage all unconference-goers to attend our full day of basic- and advanced-track <a href=\"http://thatcampgames.org/bootcamps/\">Bootcamp workshops</a>, including Darius Kazemi on making HTML5 games, Matt Kirschenbaum on learning game design from war games and conflict simulations, Todd Bryant on modding <em>Civilization IV</em>, and workshops on educational ARGs/RPGs from research teams at both the <a href=\"http://www.ArcaneGalleryOfGadgetry.org\">University of Maryland</a> and University of Connecticut.</p>\n<p>You can't have a good games conference without games, so we'll be running a conference-long ARG, a games lounge/lab where you can take a break and play games with fellow attendees, and a Sunday games design jam where you can show off your latest games work. Following the Bootcamp workshops, MITH will host a reception where you can tour the DH center, hear about UMD's gaming research, and play games on some of our platforms old and new.</p>\n<p>We welcome everyone to apply, whether you're a seasoned gamer or \"n00b\"; undergrad, tenured professor, or alternative academic. <a href=\"http://thatcampgames.org/\">Applications</a> are open now through 10/31, and the unconference will take place January 20th to 22nd at the <a href=\"http://www.umd.edu/\">University of Maryland</a> in College Park. The event is co-organized by MITH Webmaster and Literature Ph.D. student <a href=\"http://www.literaturegeek.com\">Amanda Visconti</a> (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/Literature_Geek\">@literature_geek</a>) and University of Baltimore Assistant Professor <a href=\"http://selfloud.net/\">Anastasia Salter</a> (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/AnaSalter\">@AnaSalter</a>).</p>\n<p>Please contact <a href=\"mailto:THATCampGames@gmail.com\">THATCampGames@gmail.com</a> with any questions.</p>"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
