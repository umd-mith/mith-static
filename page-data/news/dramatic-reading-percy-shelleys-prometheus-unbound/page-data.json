A condemnation of slavery in all forms, Prometheus Unbound is perhaps Shelley’s best-known and most beloved work. Inspired by Aeschylus’ classical Prometheia trilogy, Shelley adapts the mythological story of the Titan who gave man fire, refiguring the fate of mankind’s champion and the fall of the tyrant, Jupiter. It is a drama of Romantic ideals-- suffering, endurance, and freedom-- that is as relevant in today’s socio-political climate of resistance as it was two centuries ago.</p>\n<p>Wednesday, October 25, 3-5PM, Cafritz Foundation Theatre</p>\n</blockquote>"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"]}
