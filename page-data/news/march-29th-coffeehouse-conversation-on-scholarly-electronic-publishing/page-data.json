The discussion will be facilitated by Katie King (Associate Professor of Women's Studies), Matthew Kirschenbaum (Assistant Professor of English and Articles Editor for the online journal Digital Humanities Quarterly), and Claire Moses (Professor of Women's Studies and Editorial Director of the journal Feminist Studies).</p>\n<p>The format will be open and freewheeling, with plenty of opportunity for asking questions and exchanging ideas. Topics that might be expected to come up include: what it means to \"publish\" online; peer review, credit, and perceptions of prestige for online publishing; editorial standards in electronic journals; copyright and the economics of scholarly publishing in the present climate; whether the journal format itself is viable online, or whether blogs, bulletin boards, and other forums are more appropriate; libraries and electronic journals; how new media will alter the materiality and substance of scholarship; and the longevity of the scholarly record as it sheds its traditional embodiment in paper.</p>\n<p>MITH (the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities) is located in the basement of McKeldin Library, B0131. The discussion is open to all. Graduate students are especially encouraged to attend.</p>\n<p>View MITH's complete Spring Speakers Schedule here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100609001120/http://mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_spring_2006.pdf\">http://mith2.umd.edu/programs/mith_speakers_spring_2006.pdf</a></p>\n<p>Contact: Neil Fraistat, Acting Director, MITH (www.mith.umd.edu, mith@umd.edu, 5-5896).</p>"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"]}
