During the past three and a half years as assistant director of MITH, he has supervised all of our technical work while also serving as our lead programmer. At the same time, he has written a series of successful and important grants, helping us to establish an international profile in digital tool building and in the nexus of the digital humanities and the performing arts. His multimedia XML markup tool AXE has already been at the center of three recent grants; two from NEH and one from Mellon, and he was responsible for the technical design and management of the Shakespeare Quartos Archive, a project supported by an NEH/JISC grant, with the Folger Shakespeare Library, the British Library, and the Bodleian Library as our partners.</p>\n<p>Doug is currently in the midst of both a grant project and a book on the digital curation and preservation of musical theatre. In joining Matt Kirschenbaum as an associate director of MITH, Doug will oversee all of MITH's operations and supervise MITH's new assistant director Dave Lester.</p>\n<p>Neil</p>","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/mith-static/mith-static/src/news/doug-reside-promoted-to-asscoiate-director.md"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
