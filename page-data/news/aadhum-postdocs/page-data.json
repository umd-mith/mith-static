Additional funding is available for conference travel and professional development.</p>\n<p>The AADHum postdocs in the fields of Digital Humanities and African American History and Culture provide exciting opportunities to contribute to a major interdisciplinary initiative at one of the nation’s highest-ranked public research universities, as well as to gain skills and knowledge related to emerging, innovative areas of research and teaching.

Launched in late 2013, the Center for Synergy has already been recognized as on the cutting edge of public humanities, successfully conceptualizing and building collaborative projects between Arts and Humanities scholars, other disciplines and external communities. The center received one of the first NEH Humanities in the Public Square grants for its <em>Baltimore Stories</em> project, in which humanists work alongside citizens to examine the roles of narratives in the life of a major American city. The Center for Synergy will provide mentoring in best practices for developing vibrant intellectual communities, both in the form of innovative curriculum and in the form of engaging public programming, from the micro-level of reading groups to the macro-level of a national conference.</p>\n<p>Opportunities for archival work in the rich research collections at the University of Maryland will also be key components of the postdoc experience.
