The application deadline has been changed to <strong>November 5, 2019.</strong></em></p>\n<p>MITH is pleased to announce that we are accepting applications for the Fall 2020 Winnemore Digital Humanities Dissertation Fellowship. The Winnemore Fellowship provides support to a University of Maryland graduate student whose dissertation engages with digital humanities or new media and the arts and humanities.</p>\n<p>Eligible graduate students must be enrolled in an appropriate terminal degree program (Ph.D. or M.F.A) at the University of Maryland and must agree not to accept any other form of financial support from the University or other fellowships of $2,000 or more during the term for which this fellowship is awarded. Winnemore Fellows are provided a stipend of $9,929 and a $1,509 contribution toward health insurance fees. Fellows are also provided with work space at MITH, consultation with MITH staff about their project, and technical support (including server space) where applicable.</p>\n<p>Fellows are expected to be in-residence throughout the duration of their fellowship. They are encouraged to attend MITH events such as Digital Dialogues, contribute to the intellectual community of MITH, share their work on the MITH blog, participate in professional development opportunities, and be engaged with the digital humanities more broadly.</p>\n<p>Interested applicants should submit:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>a cover letter that includes your name, program/department, college, email, phone, title of dissertation, and advisor’s name, phone, and email.

Proposals should specify how a Winnemore Fellowship would be crucial to the dissertation or equivalent project’s development. The committee will place emphasis on projects that center the perspectives of underrepresented or oppressed groups and such proposals are highly encouraged. Also encouraged are projects addressing complex ethical issues inherent to engagement with new media, cultural heritage data, and the digital humanities.</p>\n<p>We encourage applicants to consult with MITH regarding their applications.
