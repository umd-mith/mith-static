Loh circulated a video</a> to the UMD community that featured selected research and creative work being conducted throughout the university. In addition to all of President Loh’s narration being shot on location at MITH, the video features the new Mellon-funded project <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/mith-partners-in-1-25-million-mellon-grant/\"><em>Synergies among Digital Humanities and African American History and Culture: An integrated research and training model</em></a>, awarded to the College of Arts and Humanities (ARHU) and co-directed by MITH and the Arts and Humanities Center for Synergy. The video includes footage of the MITH team in action on the project, along with Labor Collections Archivist Jennifer Eidson and ARHU Associate Dean for Research, Interdisciplinary Scholarship and Programming Sheri Parks.</p>\n<p>MITH is delighted to have been featured so prominently by President Loh, and is excited to start actively working on the Synergies project. Special thanks to Gabe Unterman and his team from Multimedia Production, who did a great job capturing a ‘day in the life’ at the MITH offices. See below for President Loh’s introductory message about the video.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dear University of Maryland community:</p>\n<p>Advancing science, culture, and the arts -- and translating these advances to solve the great problems of our times, enrich our quality of life, and drive economic opportunity in our state and nation -- are at the core of the University of Maryland's 21st century mission as a research and land-grant institution.</p>\n<p>The accomplishments of our faculty, students, and staff in carrying out this mission are cause for tremendous pride. I am pleased to share with you a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/aL6x6fNsouY\">4-minute video</a> that highlights some of their inspiring scholarship and creative work. I encourage you to share it with family, friends, and colleagues.</p>\n<p>This video is the first of several to be released in the coming months that celebrate the excellence and impact of our state's flagship university.</p>\n<p>You can sense the excitement and pride in the University at homecoming week, November 2 - 7. There are many spirited events: alumni gatherings, \"Terp Carnival\" on McKeldin Mall, \"Rave at Ritchie Coliseum,\" comedy show at Cole Fieldhouse, \"Gift of Giving Gala,\" \"Homecoming Stepshow,\" and other exhibits, artistic performances, and athletic competitions. These and more are listed at <a href=\"http://homecoming.umd.edu/\">www.Homecoming.umd.edu</a>. I invite you to come and connect or reconnect with your Terp family.</p>\n<p>Sincerely, Wallace D.
