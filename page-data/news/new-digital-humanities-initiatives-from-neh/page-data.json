Digital technologies offer humanists new methods of conducting research, conceptualizing relationships, and presenting scholarship. NEH is interested in fostering the growth of digital humanities and lending support to a wide variety of projects, including those that deploy digital technologies and methods to enhance our understanding of a topic or issue; those that study the impact of digital technology on the humanities--exploring the ways in which it changes how we read, write, think, and learn; and those that digitize important materials thereby increasing the public's ability to search and access humanities information.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.neh.gov/grants/digitalhumanities.html\">Details here</a>.</p>"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"]}
