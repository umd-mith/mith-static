Bringing together researchers from the digital humanities and bioinformatics communities, the symposium will explore ways in which these two communities might fruitfully collaborate on projects that bridge the humanities and medicine around the topics of sequence alignment and network analysis, two modes of analysis that intersect with “big data.” The workshop will be held April 10-12, 2012 in Washington, D.C. and College Park, MD.</p>\n<p>For more information including the call for attendees, please visit the <a href=\"http://www.mith.umd.edu/sharedhorizons/\">workshop website</a>.</p>","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/mith-static/mith-static/src/news/mith-announces-an-neh-chairmans-cooperative-agreement-for-shared-horizons.md"}},"staticQueryHashes":["196133661","2857345991"],"slicesMap":{}}
