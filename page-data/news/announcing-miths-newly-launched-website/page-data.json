As you browse through the site, you will see revised content and a fresh design that we hope will make it easier for you to navigate through our projects, staff pages, and blog posts. We’ve added in new sections highlighting DH culture and resources, our partners and affiliates, and generally just freshened up our web presence. There’s always a lot happening here at MITH, and we’ve attempted to redesign the website to make the most of our events, projects, people, and community. Congratulations to our design team of Kirsten Keister, Emma Millon, and Amanda Visconti for their imagination and hard work.
