We endeavor for this to become a monthly (or so) event in the spring semester. Meetings may take various forms--sometimes a reading group, a workshop, an opportunity to share works in progress, or simply an occasion to get together and talk. The first meeting will be a meet-and-greet, and a time to make a road map of meeting themes for the spring. We encourage faculty, staff, graduate and undergraduate students at all levels, and all degrees of familiarity with digital humanities and/or digital media, to attend.</p>\n<p>Come chat about DH, the University of Maryland, gender and sexuality, critical race, disability, and other theories of difference...everyone is welcome!</p>"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
