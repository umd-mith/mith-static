We are currently using Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances to perform natural language processing tasks on large text corpora, including a collection of approximately 117,000 books from the <a href=\"http://www.hathitrust.org/\">HathiTrust</a> that spans four centuries and several languages. Our EC2 instances also support development at MITH, host prototype applications, and archive MITHâ€™s activity in social media channels. This generous award from Amazon will allow us to expand all of these operations. Please follow the MITH blog for an upcoming series of more detailed posts about how we are using these cloud computing services to enable digital humanities research.</p>"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
