Although we will greatly miss Carl's presence day to day, he will remain a key part of MITH's staff. I'm happy to say that Carl has accepted a position with MITH as a Research Associate, through which MITH's fellows and grant projects will still be able to take advantage of his extraordinary talents as a conceptualizer of projects and a programmer. We hope to see him periodically throughout the year.</p>","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/mith-static/mith-static/src/news/carl-stahmer-in-new-role-as-research-associate.md"}},"staticQueryHashes":["196133661","2857345991"],"slicesMap":{}}
