At King’s, he contributed to several major digitization and text encoding projects while also completing an MA in Digital Humanities and pursuing his PhD. Raffaele holds a BA in Digital Humanities from the University of Pisa (Italy).</p>\n<p>Raffaele’s research focuses on the production and publication of digital scholarly editions of music, and he brings to MITH valuable expertise in the performing arts. His dissertation investigates digital approaches in musicology through a case study of a critical edition of Carl Maria von Weber's opera Der Freischütz, a project in which Raffaele is collaborating with the Weber-Gesamtausgabe at the University of Paderborn (Germany). Raffaele is also an advisor for the Music Encoding Initiative (MEI), which produces guidelines for the digital representation of music notation with a focus on scholarly requirements, and the convenor of the Text Encoding Initiative’s Special Interest Group (SIG) in Music, which addresses issues and delivers recommendations for the digitization of texts with music notation.</p>\n<p>At MITH, Raffaele's deep knowledge of encoding practices and theory and his experience in developing software and systems for humanities research will be an invaluable addition to projects such as the Shelley-Godwin Archive and ANGLES.
