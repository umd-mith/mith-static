As always, <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20100606123909/http://www.mith2.umd.edu/programs/digitaldialogue/index.php\">Digital Dialogues</a> are Tuesdays at 12:30 in the MITH conference room (McKeldin Library). We especially like seeing visitors from our neighboring campuses around town.</p>\n<p>We have a terrific line-up this semester, with local UMD talent (<strong>JONATHAN AUERBACH</strong>, <strong>MARTHA NELL SMITH</strong>, <strong>TANYA CLEMENT</strong>, <strong>JOSEPH JAJA</strong>, <strong>PHILIP RESNIK</strong>) presenting their current research on topics as diverse as digital tools for not-reading a famously unreadable book to the computational linguistics of \"spin\" to early cinema as new media to digital archiving and preservation.</p>\n<p>We also have a number of distinguished visitors from off campus, coming from places like the Smithsonian, IBM, the Internet Archive, and the NEH. Come drop by for a fireside chat with <strong>BRETT BOBLEY</strong> about the NEH's new Digital Humanities Initiative, or hear the University of Georgia's <strong>DAVID SALTZ</strong> talk about \"simulating liveness\" in his Virtual Vaudeville project and in Second Life; or hear **CHRIS FUNKHOUSER **on why electronic poetry is like Scrabble. Plus much, much more.</p>\n<p>We look forward to seeing you on Tuesday, September the 11 at 12:30 for our first event, with Tanya Clement on \"Using Digital Tools to Not-Read Gertrude Stein's The Making of Americans.\"</p>"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
