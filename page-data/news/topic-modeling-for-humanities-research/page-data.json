We've created <a href=\"http://storify.com/travisbrown/paper-machines\">a Storify post</a> recording just a few of the recent reactions to Paper Machines on Twitter.</p>\n<p>There have been a number of interesting conversations on topic modeling in the context of humanities research on Twitter in just the last couple of weeks, including these discussions about <a href=\"http://storify.com/mwidner/interpreting-topic-models\">how to evaluate and interpret topic models</a>, <a href=\"http://storify.com/travisbrown/getting-details-of-the-word-distributions-for-topi\">how to get detailed information about word distributions</a> out of <a href=\"http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/\">MALLET</a>, and <a href=\"http://storify.com/scott_bot/topic-model-as-index\">how to use topic models to aid navigation</a> of text collections.
