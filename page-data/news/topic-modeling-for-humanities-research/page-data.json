We've created <a href=\"http://storify.com/travisbrown/paper-machines\">a Storify post</a> recording just a few of the recent reactions to Paper Machines on Twitter.</p>\n<p>There have been a number of interesting conversations on topic modeling in the context of humanities research on Twitter in just the last couple of weeks, including these discussions about <a href=\"http://storify.com/mwidner/interpreting-topic-models\">how to evaluate and interpret topic models</a>, <a href=\"http://storify.com/travisbrown/getting-details-of-the-word-distributions-for-topi\">how to get detailed information about word distributions</a> out of <a href=\"http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/\">MALLET</a>, and <a href=\"http://storify.com/scott_bot/topic-model-as-index\">how to use topic models to aid navigation</a> of text collections. Many of the participants in these threads will be at the workshop next week, and we're looking forward to continuing the conversations there.</p>\n<p>We'd also like to point everyone to <a href=\"http://www.zotero.org/groups/digital_humanities_topic_modeling\">the public Zotero library</a> created by project director <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/people/person/jennifer-guiliano/\">Jennifer Guiliano</a>, which lists papers and blog posts about topic modeling methods and humanities applications; to workshop participant <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20121207133718/http://www.cs.princeton.edu:80/~mimno/\">David Mimno</a>'s <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20121227134445/http://www.cs.princeton.edu:80/~mimno/topics.html\">comprehensive bibliography</a>; and to the <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/topicmodeling\">topic modeling Subreddit</a> recently started by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mcburton\">Matt Burton</a> (who will also be at the workshop).</p>\n<p>I've also just put together <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UMD_MITH/dhtopic\">a Twitter list</a> of all of the participants whose Twitter handles I could round up, and the complete list of speakers and attendees is available <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20151224080234/http://mith.umd.edu/topicmodeling/workshop-attendees/\">on the project website</a>.
