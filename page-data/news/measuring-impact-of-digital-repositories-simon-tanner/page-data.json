Tanner will introduce the Digital Humanities at King's College London, and link this to his open and collaborative research practices to tell the story of the intellectual development of the BVI Model. He will detail the BVI Model 2.0 to highlight what's new and how it works. Tanner will relate these changes to his collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.europeana.eu/\">Europeana</a> to develop their <a href=\"https://pro.europeana.eu/post/europeana-impact-assessment-playbook\">Impact Playbook</a> and look to the future of that tool.</p>\n<p>The session will include time for questions and discussion.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p><em>Simon Tanner is Professor of Digital Cultural Heritage in the <a href=\"https://www.kcl.ac.uk/ddh\">Department of Digital Humanities</a> at Kingâ€™s College London. He is a Digital Humanities scholar with a wide-ranging interest in cross-disciplinary thinking and collaborative approaches that reflect a fascination with interactions between memory organization collections (libraries, museum, archives, media and publishing) and the digital domain.</em></p>\n<p><em>As an information professional, consultant, digitization expert and academic he works with major cultural institutions across the world to assist them in transforming their impact, collections and online presence. He has consulted for or managed over 500 digital projects, including digitization of the Dead Sea Scrolls, and has built strategy with a wide range of organizations. These include the US National Gallery of Art and many other museums and national libraries in Europe, Africa, America and the Middle East. Tanner has had work commissioned by UNESCO, the Danish government, the Arcadia Fund and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. He founded the Digital Futures Academy that has run in the UK, Australia, South Africa and Ghana with participants from over 40 countries.</em></p>\n<p><em>Research into image use and sales in American art museums by Simon Tanner has had a significant effect on opening up collections access and OpenGLAM in the museum sector. Tanner is a strong advocate for Open Access, open research and the digital humanities. Tanner was chair of the Web Archiving sub-committee as an independent member of the UK Government-appointed Legal Deposit Advisory Panel. He is a member of the Europeana Impact Taskforce which developed the Impact Playbook based upon his Balanced Value Impact Model. He is part of the AHRC funded Academic Book of the Future research team.</em></p>","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/mith-static/mith-static/src/news/measuring-impact-of-digital-repositories-simon-tanner.md"}},"staticQueryHashes":["196133661","2857345991"],"slicesMap":{}}
