Users can collaboratively tag a text in TEI, associate XML with time stamps in video or audio files, and mark off regions of an image to be linked to external metadata. With an intuitive, web-based interface, AXE makes the process of preparing online digital editions and archives more efficient and accurate. AXE also facilitates collaboration in the digital humanities by permitting multiple scholars to work on the same document or archive at the same time from various locations, and will track all work so that variant versions can be collated and all versions can be archived. The Ajax XML encoder, with its intuitive Web-based interface, will come as a breath of fresh air to those who have previously been frustrated by text-centric tagging tools which require an expert knowledge of mark-up languages.</p>\n<p>DOUG RESIDE is the Assistant Director of the Maryland Institute of Technology in the Humanities (MITH) and a Visiting Assistant Professor of Theater at the University of Maryland in College Park. Doug holds undergraduate degrees in Computer Science and English and earned his PhD in English at the University of Kentucky where he worked on several digital humanities projects, including Kevin Kiernan's celebrated Electronic Boethius. Doug's primary research interest is musical theater and the way in which digital technology can be used both to create and to preserve the art form. In addition to his managerial, and programming work at MITH, Doug is currently working on a book on the \"born-digital\" musical.</p>\n<p>Coming up @MITH 9/16: Stan Katz, \"Digital Humanities 3.0: Where We Have Come From and Where We Are Now?\"</p>\n<p>Watch for MITH's complete Digital Dialogues schedule available soon!</p>\n<p>All talks free and open to the public!</p>\n<p>Contact: Neil Fraistat, Director, MITH (<a href=\"http://www.mith.umd.edu\">www.mith.umd.edu</a>, <a href=\"mailto:mith@umd.edu\">mith@umd.edu</a>, 5-8927).</p>","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/mith-static/mith-static/src/news/september-9th-digitial-dialogue-doug-reside-the-mithological-axe-multimedia-metadata-encoding-with-the-ajax-xml-encoder.md"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
