The demo is just that: a demonstration of possible functionalities.This post will outline some of the features that were always meant to be temporary and some new planned or desired features, and then invite comments.</p>\n<h3>What will be changed</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The selection of witnesses. Entering numerals is unwieldy. Ideally, users should be able to slide text “icons” around (as one does with a pivot table in Excel, for instance)</li>\n<li>Output in browse functions. A single chapter was used for the demo version. Future versions will allow users to select specific chapters and/or specific ms pages and progress by page or chapter. Metadata should perhaps be hideable.</li>\n<li>Output in collate functions. The demo groups output together; these are actually alternative functions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Additional basic functionalities</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability to download or print results.</li>\n<li>Ability to compare longer texts (whole chapters)</li>\n<li>Improved collation–and/or the ability to select alternative collation methods</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Desiderata</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Statistical tools, such as multi-dimensional scaling and clustering, to group manuscripts and display results</li>\n<li>Since there will inevitably be errors in collation, ability to correct alignment and re-run various operations</li>\n<li>Dynamic synoptic view, in which two or more witnesses can be viewed in parallel columns, with the ability to highlight textual differences or other features.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Hayim Lapin is Robert H.
