In addition, recipients will receive $1,000 for travel to conferences where work from the dissertation can be presented.</p>\n<p>Nominees will be evaluated on three main criteria:</p>\n<p>1. The potential contribution of the dissertation to the Digital Humanities.</p>\n<p>2. The quality of the student's work.</p>\n<p>3. The likelihood of the student successfully completing the dissertation.</p>\n<p>Applicants will be asked to submit an application form; a 500-1000 word abstract written for a general audience; a statement of work completed to date, work remaining, and expected completion date; a curriculum vitae; and two letters of recommendation, one of which must be from the student's dissertation director.</p>\n<p>Students who wish to apply for the fellowship should submit a copy of the application form and the required attachments to Neil Fraistat, Director of MITH, McKeldin Library B0131, Campus.</p>\n<p>Students who have funding that is related to their dissertation research or another substantial fellowship should not apply.</p>\n<p><strong>Applications for Spring 2007 are due at MITH by noon, Monday, December 4, 2006</strong>. The recipient will be announced in mid-December 2006.</p>\n<p>Please address any questions to Neil Fraistat, Director of MITH.</p>"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"]}
