We are pleased to announce that we have received a grant from the Access to Artistic Excellence program of the <a href=\"http://www.nea.gov\">National Endowment for the Arts</a> to build Music Theater Online: 1866-1923.</p>\n<p>Music Theater Online (MTO) will continue work begun under an NEH-funded Digital Humanities Startup grant, by providing free, online access to twelve historic musicals. NYPL Digital Curator for the Performing Arts (and former MITH Associate Director), Doug Reside, and William Everett, Professor of Musicology at the University of Missouri-Kansas City will supervise the project. Each month the team will post a libretto of an important early American musical in a variety of formats and supplement it with associated photographs, vocal scores, and the occasional audio file. The transcribed scores will be tagged using the <a href=\"http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/P5/\">Text Encoding Initiative</a> (TEI) P5 Guidelines, allowing the user to select a section of the text and hear the corresponding audio. In addition, Reside and several guest editors will add contextual and historical information about the shows on <a href=\"http://www.nypl.org/blog/2011/05/18/announcing-musical-month\">Reside's NYPL blog</a>. The first title in the series, The Black Crook (1866) is <a href=\"http://www.nypl.org/blog/2011/06/02/musical-month-black-crook\">now available</a>.</p>\n<p>Please return to the MITH blog to read more on the latest developments regarding our innovative digital work in the humanities.</p>"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
