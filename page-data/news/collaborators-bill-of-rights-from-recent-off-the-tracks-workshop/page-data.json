One of the most salient outcomes of the workshop is a <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/offthetracks/recommendations/\">Collaborators' Bill of Rights</a>.</p>\n<p>In the afternoon of the last day of the workshop, the participants divided into four subgroups tasked with discussing models for institutional support, models for career paths, models for collaboration, and models for transformation. This initial draft was written by the “collaboration team” which includes Matthew Kirschenbaum, Bethany Nowviskie, Tom Scheinfeldt, and Doug Reside. They posted <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/offthetracks/recommendations/\">a very rough draft</a> just hours later in the hopes that it would provoke further discussion by the larger community. The larger community has responded with <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/offthetracks/recommendations/\">poignant comments</a> and on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#trx4hx\">Twitter</a>. The hashtag for the event was #trx4hx.</p>\n<p>The entire draft of recommendations are forthcoming.</p>"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"]}
