The documentary depicts miners in Potosi, Bolivia, who extract silver, zinc, and lead from the mountain in the same precarious conditions as their ancestors did five centuries ago. Tourist agencies and transnational mining companies promise to bring in additional revenue for the miners, but it is apparent that the 'rich' mountain is dying.</p>\n<p>Campus funding from CAPA, MITH, and ARHU DRI funds, as well as maintenance funds from Fulbright-Hays, helped defray the costs of several years of travel, filming, and</p>\n<p>editing.</p>\n<p>The film will screen at MITH next week, on February 14th as part of our Digital Dialogues series.</p>"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"]}
