She recently graduated from the University of Maryland College Park where she was a McNair Scholar and majored in African American studies. The landscape of her work is the dream-like space after tragedy: The zone of remembering, with a focus on texts and media that historicizes memory and amnesia. Katelin explores the digital as a tool of remembrance and a theoretical perspective that helps understand how time, space, collective memory and forgetting works in Black Atlantic life, culture, and intellectual tradition. Katelin is interested in crafting digital tools that reflect how Black people imagine themselves and the applications of digital humanities in Black expressive life.</p>","title":["Hybrid & Experimental Arts & Humanities Associate"],"website":null,"twitter":null,"phone":null,"email":null,"bio_external":null,"research_interests":null,"people_groups":[{"data":{"group_name":"Research Faculty + Staff"}}],"new_id":631}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
