She is also a member of the Immersive Realities Lab for the Humanities (irLh).\nFocusing on digitalityâ€™s place in Black and American life, she explores how digital technologies stretch and remodel the present limits of storytelling and memorialization, warp time, shrink space, and democratize resources. She remains attuned to the ways it can reproduce marginalization and obstruct access in the United States. As a result, she feels called to helping create digital tools that are equitable and humanistic at its core.\nPrior to joining the team, Christin was a Community Partnerships Associate at DonorsChoose, an edtech company that provides learning materials to public school students across the United States. Christin is an alumna of Amherst College where she received a B.A. with the highest distinction in Black Studies and Political Science.</p>","title":["Research Fellow, AADHum"],"website":null,"twitter":"christinwa9","phone":null,"email":"cwashing@umd.edu","bio_external":null,"research_interests":null,"people_groups":[{"data":{"group_name":"Interns + Assistants"}}],"new_id":363}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
