He holds a Ph.D. in Digital Musicology from the Department of Digital Humanities at King’s College London, where he also contributed to several major digitization and text encoding projects.\nRaff's research is grounded in digital humanities and textual scholarship, where “text” includes musical notation. More specifically, he seeks to advance textual scholarship by finding new and efficient practices to coherently and digitally model and edit (publish, or make available) text and music notation sources as digital scholarly resources. In adopting and developing new research methods, he deliberately takes a multicultural perspective by engaging with multilingual content, facing the diverse realities of the constraints in accessing and creating digital scholarly content, and by adopting a global approach to teaching and learning.\nRaff is currently an elected member of the Text Encoding Initiative technical council and the Technical Editor of the Scholarly Editing journal.</p>","title":["Senior Research Software Developer"],"website":"http://raffviglianti.com","twitter":"raffazizzi","phone":null,"email":"rviglian@umd.edu","bio_external":null,"research_interests":null,"people_groups":[{"data":{"group_name":"Research Faculty + Staff"}},{"data":{"group_name":"Speaker"}}],"new_id":6}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
