We intend, as we develop an OCR correction system designed to create opportunities for users to improve the system and not just the text itself, to examine how explorations of a users' preferences can improve their engagement with corpora of materials.\n<em>The technological infrastructure for this project has been supported in part by a generous grant from <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/\">Amazon Web Services</a>.</em></p>"}},"researchExcerpt":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Active OCR: Tightening the Loop in Human Computing for OCR Correction will develop a proof-of-concept application that will experiment with the use of active learning and other iterative techniques for the correction of eighteenth-century texts.</p>"}},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/45728eb233f0da0969ccd8b50164a26f/692d9/WT5jODB29Zo5ccTTLajXDbqtMHXwDS0OqsA6RgL8-vA.png","srcSet":"/static/45728eb233f0da0969ccd8b50164a26f/e8f34/WT5jODB29Zo5ccTTLajXDbqtMHXwDS0OqsA6RgL8-vA.png 350w,\n/static/45728eb233f0da0969ccd8b50164a26f/69510/WT5jODB29Zo5ccTTLajXDbqtMHXwDS0OqsA6RgL8-vA.png 700w,\n/static/45728eb233f0da0969ccd8b50164a26f/692d9/WT5jODB29Zo5ccTTLajXDbqtMHXwDS0OqsA6RgL8-vA.png 1400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/45728eb233f0da0969ccd8b50164a26f/ecc62/WT5jODB29Zo5ccTTLajXDbqtMHXwDS0OqsA6RgL8-vA.webp 350w,\n/static/45728eb233f0da0969ccd8b50164a26f/cf31b/WT5jODB29Zo5ccTTLajXDbqtMHXwDS0OqsA6RgL8-vA.webp 700w,\n/static/45728eb233f0da0969ccd8b50164a26f/6163b/WT5jODB29Zo5ccTTLajXDbqtMHXwDS0OqsA6RgL8-vA.webp 1400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":282}}}},"active":"FALSE","title":"Active OCR","twitter_account":null,"twitter_hashtag":null,"year_start":2012,"month_start":6,"year_end":2014,"month_end":5,"participants":[{"name":"Paul Evans","affiliations":[{"title":"Research Assistant (Active OCR)","department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"start":2011,"end":2013,"person_group":null,"slug":"paul-evans","new_id":116}],"directors":[{"name":"Travis Brown","affiliations":[{"title":"Research & Development Software Developer","department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"start":2011,"end":2012,"person_group":null,"slug":"travis-brown","new_id":25}],"links":[{"title":"Code Repository","url":"https://github.com/umd-mith/activeocr","type":"url"}],"sponsors":[{"name":"National Endowment for the Humanities","website":"neh.gov","type":"External","slug":"neh"},{"name":"Amazon Web Services","website":"aws.amazon.com","type":"External","slug":"aws"}],"partners":[],"events":[],"posts":[{"post_title":"OCR, XML, Topic Modeling, and Braille Accessibility: Coming Soon Thanks to the NEH!","author":"mith","author_name":"MITH ","post_date":"March 21, 2012","slug":"ocr-xml-topic-modeling-and-braille-accessibility-coming-soon-thanks-to-the-neh"}],"disciplines":[{"term":"Humanities computing","type":"Discipline"}],"methods":[{"term":"mobile applications development and analysis","type":"Method"}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
