It also concerns the processes of inclusion and exclusion through which bodies of texts take shape in the form of editions, archives, collections, and exhibition building, as well as the ethical responsibilities faced by textual scholars, archivists, conservationists, media archaeologists, digital resource creators, and cultural heritage professionals engaging in these processes.\n<a href=\"../../announcing-society-textual-scholarships-2017-call-papers/index.html\">Call for Papers</a> (due March 6, 2017) -- <em>CFP Closed</em></p>"}},"researchExcerpt":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>In May 2017, MITH and the African American Digital Humanities Initiative (AADHum) are hosting \"Textual Embodiments,\" the Society for Textual Scholarship's 2017 International Interdisciplinary Conference.</p>"}},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/72c0e5e0b670db5e77bba030e90f10cd/72fd4/m_LLioD9htYzxd-XdtZjSmq5zitSsCXA-vIGPjnVXBU.jpg","srcSet":"/static/72c0e5e0b670db5e77bba030e90f10cd/4c69d/m_LLioD9htYzxd-XdtZjSmq5zitSsCXA-vIGPjnVXBU.jpg 350w,\n/static/72c0e5e0b670db5e77bba030e90f10cd/554a8/m_LLioD9htYzxd-XdtZjSmq5zitSsCXA-vIGPjnVXBU.jpg 700w,\n/static/72c0e5e0b670db5e77bba030e90f10cd/72fd4/m_LLioD9htYzxd-XdtZjSmq5zitSsCXA-vIGPjnVXBU.jpg 1400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/72c0e5e0b670db5e77bba030e90f10cd/194c7/m_LLioD9htYzxd-XdtZjSmq5zitSsCXA-vIGPjnVXBU.webp 350w,\n/static/72c0e5e0b670db5e77bba030e90f10cd/e62d6/m_LLioD9htYzxd-XdtZjSmq5zitSsCXA-vIGPjnVXBU.webp 700w,\n/static/72c0e5e0b670db5e77bba030e90f10cd/e2891/m_LLioD9htYzxd-XdtZjSmq5zitSsCXA-vIGPjnVXBU.webp 1400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":400}}}},"active":"FALSE","title":"Textual Embodiments: 2017 Society for Textual Scholarship Conference","twitter_account":null,"twitter_hashtag":null,"year_start":2017,"month_start":5,"year_end":2017,"month_end":6,"participants":[{"name":"Purdom Lindblad","affiliations":[{"title":"Assistant Director for Innovation and Learning","department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"start":null,"end":null,"person_group":["current"],"slug":"purdom-lindblad","new_id":3},{"name":"Catherine Knight Steele","affiliations":[{"title":"Director of AADHum","department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"start":2016,"end":2018,"person_group":null,"slug":"catherine-knight-steele","new_id":13},{"name":"Raff Viglianti","affiliations":[{"title":"Research Programmer","department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"start":2013,"end":null,"person_group":["current"],"slug":"raffaele-viglianti","new_id":6},{"name":"Stephanie Sapienza","affiliations":[{"title":"Project Manager","department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"start":2013,"end":2018,"person_group":["current"],"slug":"stephanie-sapienza","new_id":7}],"directors":[{"name":"Neil Fraistat","affiliations":[{"title":"Director","department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"start":2006,"end":2017,"person_group":null,"slug":"neil-fraistat","new_id":22}],"links":[{"title":"Conference Website","url":"http://mith.umd.edu/sts2017/","type":"url"}],"sponsors":[],"partners":[],"events":[{"id":"textual-embodiments-2017-society-for-textual-scholarship-conference","event_title":"Textual Embodiments: 2017 Society for Textual Scholarship Conference","talk_title":"Textual Embodiments","talk_subtitle":"2017 Society for Textual Scholarship Conference","type":["Conference"],"start":"2017-05-31T04:00:00.000Z","end":"2017-06-02T04:00:00.000Z","location":"McKeldin 6137 (Special Events Room)"}],"posts":[{"post_title":"Announcing the Society for Textual Scholarship's 2017 Call for Papers","author":"mith","author_name":"MITH ","post_date":"January 25, 2017","slug":"announcing-society-textual-scholarships-2017-call-papers"},{"post_title":"Registration is now open for ‘Textual Embodiments,’ the 2017 STS annual conference!","author":"mith","author_name":"MITH ","post_date":"April 4, 2017","slug":"registration-now-open-textual-embodiments-2017-sts-annual-conference"}],"disciplines":[{"term":"Informatics","type":"Discipline"}],"methods":[{"term":"text encoding and markup language creation, deployment, and analysis","type":"Method"}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
