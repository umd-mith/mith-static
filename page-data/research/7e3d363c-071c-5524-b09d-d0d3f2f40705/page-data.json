An artifact of great significance to cultural, religious, and social history, this text manifests itself in several forms dating roughly from the eleventh to the fifteenth century, including a significant 1492 printed edition. Led by Hayim Lapin, Ph.D., Robert H. Smith Professor of Jewish Studies and professor of History at the University of Maryland, the project will encode the text in TEI, in order to provide a research tool for the collation and comparison of text. Additionally, the database will include targeted searching, transcriptions, and an annotated translation for a wider audience.\n<em>The technological infrastructure for this project has been supported in part by a generous grant from <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/\">Amazon Web Services</a>.</em></p>"}},"researchExcerpt":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Digital Mishnah will create a digital
