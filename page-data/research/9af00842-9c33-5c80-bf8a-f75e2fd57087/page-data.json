The Shakespeare Quartos Archive has been established as the result of joint support from the US National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), and the UK Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC). Through this international collaboration, many of the earliest Shakespeare quartos are now freely available for in-depth study to students of Shakespeare across the globe.</p>"}},"researchExcerpt":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>The Shakespeare Quartos Archive is a digital collection of pre-1642 editions of William Shakespeare's plays.
