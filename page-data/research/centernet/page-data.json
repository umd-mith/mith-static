It developed from a meeting hosted by the U.S. National Endowment for the Humanities and the University of Maryland, College Park, April 12-13, 2007 in Washington, D.C., and is a response to the American Council of Learned Societies report on Cyberinfrastructure for the Humanities and Social Sciences, published in 2006. Since its inception in April 2007, centerNet has added over 200 members from about 100 centers in 19 countries. Regional centerNet affiliates have been established in Asia Pacific, Europe, North America, and the U.K. and Ireland, each with a steering committee. In  2009, centerNet became a founding member with DARIAH, CLARIN, PROJECT BAMBOO, and ADHO of CHAIN: the Coalition of Humanities and Arts Infrastructures and Networks. In June 2010, centerNet formally affiliated with the Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes (CHCI) in order to pursue an ambitious agenda of initiatives on matters of mutual interest. Together, the two organizations hope to foster disciplinary innovation and transformation in the humanities.</p>"}},"researchExcerpt":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>centerNet is an international network of digital humanities centers formed for cooperative and collaborative action to benefit digital humanities and allied fields in general, and centers as humanities cyberinfrastructure in particular.
