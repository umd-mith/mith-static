Rosemarie is a renowned scholar in what is now a very established Disability Studies field, and the DISC project was an outgrowth of her very early work starting in the mid-90’s attempting to establish this as a legitimate academic field of study. The DISC site was an international, interdisciplinary, user-generated, digital forum providing support, collegial networks, and information that sustains a disability studies academic community and promotes disability studies in a humanities focus. DISC was in part built by the disability studies community through crowdsourced contributions of information.\nSite components included resources such as syllabi and speakers banks, a directory of scholars, publishing and job/grant opportunities, and directory of Disability Studies programs. It also included a searchable archive for the DS-HUM list serv, information on disability legislation, links to professional organizations, museums and exhibits.</p>"}},"excerpt":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>The DISC website was a MITH Fellowship project of Rosemarie Garland-Thomson, and was an outgrowth of her early work, begun in the mid-1990's, attempting to establish disability studies as a legitimate academic field of study.
