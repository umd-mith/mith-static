However, they are not very approachable to library/archives professionals in terms of interface and documentation.\nThere are two fundamental needs for collecting institutions that are not addressed by software designed for the digital forensics industry: incorporation into the workflow of archives/library ingest and collection management environments, and provision of public access to the data.\nTo address these needs, over phase one of the BitCurator project (October 2011 – September 2013), the BitCurator team developed the BitCurator environment, a highly customized version of Ubuntu Linux. The BitCurator environment includes a suite of open source digital forensics tools along with a custom interface that make these tools accessible to librarians and archivists working with digital media. Through the use of these tools, Libraries Archives and Museums (LAMs) can capture bit-for-bit copies of data contained on digital storage devices, scan digital holdings for sensitive information, generate technical metadata reports detailing the content of digital media, and more. Over the course of this development, the BitCurator team was advised by two groups of external partners: a <a href=\"http://www.bitcurator.net/people/#pep\">Professional Expert Panel</a> (PEP) of individuals who are at various levels of implementing digital forensics tools and methods in their collecting institutions, and a <a href=\"http://www.bitcurator.net/people/#dag\">Development Advisory Group</a> (DAG) of individuals who have significant experience with software development.\nPhase two of the BitCurator project (October 2013 – September 2014) continued the development of the BitCurator environment and, in addition, included a concerted outreach and engagement effort to build a sustaining BitCurator users community. These outreach and community building efforts were spearheaded by the BitCurator Community Lead who conducted both online and in-person BitCurator trainings at collecting institutions across the United States and Europe.\nNow at the conclusion of phase two, <a href=\"http://www.bitcurator.net/bitcurator-consortium/\">the BitCurator Consortium</a> (BCC) has been established as an independent, community-led membership association that will serve as the host and center of administrative, user and community support for the BitCurator environment. As a charter member of the BCC, MITH will continue to be an active partner in the BitCurator project as it enters the next phase of its development.\n<em>BitCurator has been funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.</em></p>"}},"researchExcerpt":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>The BitCurator project has been a joint effort led by the School of Information and Library Science at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (SILS) and the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) to develop a system for collecting professionals that incorporates the functionality of many digital forensics tools.</p>"}},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/b72c339e85978c94c1ee247a07f5bf3f/c0796/9JSw4s2FGOSJ6W4TsrzkVnW_fq_PXwdnukxeFSdsWUQ.png","srcSet":"/static/b72c339e85978c94c1ee247a07f5bf3f/4267a/9JSw4s2FGOSJ6W4TsrzkVnW_fq_PXwdnukxeFSdsWUQ.png 350w,\n/static/b72c339e85978c94c1ee247a07f5bf3f/3cb65/9JSw4s2FGOSJ6W4TsrzkVnW_fq_PXwdnukxeFSdsWUQ.png 700w,\n/static/b72c339e85978c94c1ee247a07f5bf3f/c0796/9JSw4s2FGOSJ6W4TsrzkVnW_fq_PXwdnukxeFSdsWUQ.png 1400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/b72c339e85978c94c1ee247a07f5bf3f/5cb2d/9JSw4s2FGOSJ6W4TsrzkVnW_fq_PXwdnukxeFSdsWUQ.webp 350w,\n/static/b72c339e85978c94c1ee247a07f5bf3f/dee1a/9JSw4s2FGOSJ6W4TsrzkVnW_fq_PXwdnukxeFSdsWUQ.webp 700w,\n/static/b72c339e85978c94c1ee247a07f5bf3f/69eec/9JSw4s2FGOSJ6W4TsrzkVnW_fq_PXwdnukxeFSdsWUQ.webp 1400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":248}}}},"active":"FALSE","title":"BitCurator","twitter_account":null,"twitter_hashtag":null,"year_start":2011,"month_start":1,"year_end":2014,"month_end":9,"participants":[{"name":"Porter Olsen","affiliations":[{"title":"BitCurator Community Lead","department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"start":2013,"end":2014,"person_group":null,"slug":"porter-olsen","new_id":49},{"name":"Amanda Visconti","affiliations":[{"title":"Graduate Assistant, BitCurator Project","department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"start":2013,"end":2014,"person_group":null,"slug":"amanda-visconti","new_id":108},{"name":"Kyle Bickoff","affiliations":[{"title":"Graduate Research Assistant (BitCurator)","department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"start":null,"end":null,"person_group":null,"slug":"kyle-bickoff","new_id":480},{"name":"Kam Woods","affiliations":[{"title":"Postdoctoral Research Associate","department":"School of Information and Library Science","institution":"University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill"}],"start":null,"end":null,"person_group":null,"slug":"kam-woods","new_id":291},{"name":"Alex Chassanoff","affiliations":[{"title":"PhD Candidate","department":"School of Information and Library Science","institution":"University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill"}],"start":null,"end":null,"person_group":null,"slug":"alex-chassanoff","new_id":193},{"name":"Sunitha Misra","affiliations":[{"title":"Graduate Student","department":"School of Information and Library Sciences","institution":"University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill"}],"start":null,"end":null,"person_group":null,"slug":"sunitha-misra","new_id":350}],"directors":[{"name":"Christopher (Cal) Lee","affiliations":[{"title":"Associate Professor","department":"School of Information and Library Science","institution":"University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill"}],"start":null,"end":null,"person_group":null,"slug":"christopher-lee","new_id":228},{"name":"Matthew Kirschenbaum","affiliations":[{"title":"Associate Director","department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"start":2006,"end":2016,"person_group":null,"slug":"matthew-kirschenbaum","new_id":11}],"links":[{"title":"BitCurator Website","url":"http://www.bitcurator.net/","type":"url"},{"title":"From Bitstreams to Heritage: Putting Digital Forensics into Practice in Collecting Institutions (Whitepaper)","url":"http://hdl.handle.net/1903/14736","type":"url"}],"sponsors":[{"name":"The Andrew W.
