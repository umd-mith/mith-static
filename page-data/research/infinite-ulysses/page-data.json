A variety of sorting, filtering, and toggling options customize the experience to an individual reader's needs, whether that reader knows Church Latin, wants to avoid spoilers, needs extra help as a first-time reader, or is a scholar studying <em>Ulysses</em>' puzzles or the function of written material (letters, poems, etc.) throughout the novel.\nAs part of her process, Visconti conducted user testing to gauge the <a href=\"http://www.literaturegeek.com/2012/11/03/the3us/\">use, usefulness, and usability</a> of the edition. Digital editions are a key humanities scholarly form, but often we don't base our understanding of how they are read and used on data gathered through formal user testing. She used test and analytics data to support the speculative design of the edition as an \"infinite\" <em>Ulysses</em> conversation. Could the site still produce customized reading experiences while storing an \"infinite\" quantity of annotations of various quality? What happens to complex texts---especially those authored to be hypertextual, chaotic, and encyclopedic, like <em>Ulysses</em>---when a participatory digital edition places them under \"infinite\" annotations and conversations? Visconti gathered data on reading behavior---such as what pages of the book take users the longest to read, or receive the most annotations, or the most contentious (both up- and down-voted) annotations---as part of her research.</p>"}},"excerpt":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Infinite Ulysses was the 2014-15 Winnemore Digital Dissertation project of Amanda Visconti, who created a participatory digital edition of James Joyce's difficult but rewarding novel Ulysses.
