Together with the existing <a href=\"http://mith.umd.edu/larsen/\">Deena Larsen Collection</a>, also housed at MITH, these two collections position MITH as a major center of study for anyone interested in primary source materials–both manuscript and born-digital–from this unique moment in literary and technological history.\nBly’s collection includes numerous exemplars of hypertext fiction and poetry collected over the years, as well as his own notes and variations for <em>We Descend</em>, his ongoing hyper-fiction, the first volume of which was published by Eastgate Systems in 1997. The collection is particularly rich in materials related to the early Macintosh software HyperCard, used as the platform for dozens of works of early electronic literature.\nMITH Associate Director Matthew Kirschenbaum says “We at MITH see Bill’s gift as a <em>living archive</em>, to be accessed, explored, and enjoyed as openly as possible by students and researchers. We will be working to catalog and describe the materials, and we welcome anyone with an interest in exploring the history of hypertext to contact us about a visit.”</p>"}},"researchExcerpt":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>The Bill Bly Collection of Electronic Literature is a rich archive of materials from the early literary hypertext movement, received as a generous donation to MITH directly from Bill Bly.</p>"}},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#e8e8e8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/69de385df79a70a0f12159532003d645/fea72/header_bill-bly.jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/69de385df79a70a0f12159532003d645/c5879/header_bill-bly.jpg 350w,\n/mith-static/static/69de385df79a70a0f12159532003d645/748f3/header_bill-bly.jpg 700w,\n/mith-static/static/69de385df79a70a0f12159532003d645/fea72/header_bill-bly.jpg 1400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/69de385df79a70a0f12159532003d645/9ad72/header_bill-bly.webp 350w,\n/mith-static/static/69de385df79a70a0f12159532003d645/3632d/header_bill-bly.webp 700w,\n/mith-static/static/69de385df79a70a0f12159532003d645/50f28/header_bill-bly.webp 1400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":360}}}},"active":"FALSE","title":"Bill Bly Collection","twitter_account":null,"twitter_hashtag":null,"year_start":2011,"month_start":11,"year_end":null,"month_end":null,"participants":[{"name":"Amanda Visconti","affiliations":[{"title":"Webmaster","department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"start":2009,"end":2013,"person_group":null,"slug":"amanda-visconti","new_id":108},{"name":"Porter Olsen","affiliations":[{"title":"PhD Candidate","department":"English Department","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"start":null,"end":null,"person_group":null,"slug":"porter-olsen","new_id":49}],"directors":[{"name":"Matthew Kirschenbaum","affiliations":[{"title":"Associate Director","department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"start":2006,"end":2016,"person_group":null,"slug":"matthew-kirschenbaum","new_id":11}],"links":[],"sponsors":[],"partners":[],"events":[],"posts":[{"post_title":"Preserving the Roguish Form: A Conversation in Hypertexts with Bill Bly and Deena Larsen","author":"mith","author_name":"MITH ","post_date":"May 25, 2011","slug":"preserving-the-roguish-form-a-conversation-in-hypertexts-with-bill-bly-and-deena-larsen"},{"post_title":"MITH Receives the Bill Bly Collection of Electronic Literature","author":"mith","author_name":"MITH ","post_date":"November 10, 2011","slug":"mith-receives-the-bill-bly-collection-of-electronic-literature"},{"post_title":"We Descended: Processing the Bill Bly Collection with the UMD Born-Digital Working Group","author":"mith","author_name":"MITH ","post_date":"October 12, 2012","slug":"we-descended-processing-the-bill-bly-collection-with-the-umd-born-digital-working-group"},{"post_title":"Born Digital Working Group: Configuring FRED","author":"rachel-donahue","author_name":"Rachel Donahue","post_date":"April 8, 2013","slug":"born-digital-working-group-configuring-fred"},{"post_title":"MITH's Research & Collections featured on NPR's All Things Considered","author":"mith","author_name":"MITH ","post_date":"April 9, 2014","slug":"miths-research-collections-featured-nprs-things-considered"}],"disciplines":[{"term":"Informatics","type":"Discipline"},{"term":"Literary studies","type":"Discipline"}],"methods":[{"term":"digital archiving","type":"Method"},{"term":"electronic literature production and analysis","type":"Method"}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"]}
