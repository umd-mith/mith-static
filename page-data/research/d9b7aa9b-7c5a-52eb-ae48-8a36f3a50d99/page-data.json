For this reason, the vast standard is typically <em>customized</em> before being used in a specific project (see our customization for the Shelley-Godwin Archive).\nThe TEI can be customized using the XML vocabulary from a dedicated module of the TEI (called ODD). To simplify this process, TEI users have relied for years on a dedicated PHP online tool called Roma. Raff Viglianti is rewriting this tool as a React/Redux web application to modernize the user experience, expand the features of the tool, and improve its chances for long term use and preservation.\nVisit the tool's GitHub repository (in the 'Links' section) to see previews and report issues.</p>"}},"researchExcerpt":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>RomaJS is a web app for customizing TEI and other ODD-based formats such as MEI.</p>"}},"image":null},"active":"TRUE","title":"RomaJS","twitter_account":null,"twitter_hashtag":null,"year_start":2016,"month_start":4,"year_end":null,"month_end":null,"participants":[],"directors":[{"name":"Raff Viglianti","affiliations":[{"title":"Research Programmer","department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"start":2013,"end":null,"person_group":["current"],"slug":"raffaele-viglianti","new_id":6}],"links":[{"title":"RomaJS code base on GitHub","url":"https://github.com/raffazizzi/romajs","type":"url"}],"sponsors":[],"partners":[],"events":[],"posts":[{"post_title":"\"How Can You Love a Work If You Don't Know It?\": Six Lessons from Team MARKUP","author":"amanda-visconti","author_name":"Amanda Visconti","post_date":"April 27, 2012","slug":"how-can-you-love-a-work-if-you-dont-know-it-six-lessons-from-team-markup"},{"post_title":"Apply for Advanced TEI Seminar at MITH!","author":"mith","author_name":"MITH ","post_date":"August 3, 2009","slug":"apply-for-advanced-tei-seminar-at-mith"}],"disciplines":[{"term":"Humanities computing","type":"Discipline"},{"term":"Informatics","type":"Discipline"}],"methods":[{"term":"text encoding and markup language creation, deployment, and analysis","type":"Method"}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
