The design of this prototype application is intended to leverage the effort of scholars as they identify and select relevant resources from the HathiTrust corpus to create collections (“worksets”) useful for scholarly analyses. Mallios and the FLA team will experiment with using the prototype to continue their work studying the reception of foreign and immigrant authored literary works in the U.S., in interdisciplinary terms that encompass literature, culture, politics, history, and international relations.\nIn addition to leveraging previous collaborations with Mallios and FLA, this work builds directly on previous MITH work by Travis Brown, MITH Assistant Director of Research and Development, on a system for HathiTrust metadata correction developed by as part of a partnership between MITH and the <a href=\"https://digitalhumanities.princeton.edu/ppa/\">Princeton Prosody Archive</a>.</p>"}},"excerpt":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>In collaboration with the HathiTrust Research Center (HTRC), MITH will develop a prototype application to facilitate the distributed correction and enhancement of HathiTrust metadata records.
