It is a work that remains relevant to contemporary cultural debates concerning issues ranging from biomedical technologies and the ethical questions they raise to misperceptions and misrepresentations of the Other and their impact on our shared humanity. <em>Frankenstein</em> sparks imagination and critical thinking about the human experience, and thus it is perhaps no surprise that it is the most widely taught literary text in the country and the fifth most widely taught book from any discipline.\nTo commemorate the bicentennial of the novel and also to harness its power to generate and inspire communities of readers, the <a href=\"http://k-saa.org/\">Keats-Shelley Association of America</a> in partnership with the <a href=\"https://www.neh.gov/\">National Endowment for the Humanities</a> is launching \"Frankenreads\": a \"Bloomsday\"-style, national/international public reading of <em>Frankenstein</em> on October 31, 2018. We hope to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>engage an international community, including but not limited to North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia Pacific in related activities centering on the novel;</li>\n<li>to make this community visible globally as a community through shared branding and social media;</li>\n<li>to livestream a public reading of <em>Frankenstein</em> to be held at NEH headquarters for those around the world who are unable to attend one in person;</li>\n<li>to facilitate bringing regional experts of the novel to such events as lectures, discussions, and film showings held at local libraries and community centers;</li>\n<li>to hold in the days leading up to <a href=\"http://frankenreads.org\">Frankenreads</a> an international \"Week of <em>Frankenstein</em>,\" during which students, teachers, and the public could hold <em>Frankenstein</em> related events and contribute their thoughts, images, and short videos about <em>Frankenstein</em> to a collective blog.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We invite you to discover already planned events near you, or to join our growing list of partners by proposing your own!</p>"}},"researchExcerpt":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Frankenreads is an NEH-funded initiative of the Keats-Shelley Association of America and partners to hold a series of events and initiatives in honor of the 200th anniversary of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, featuring especially an international series of readings of the full text of the novel on Halloween 2018.</p>"}},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/d64abdee55fd5db8920de44218d879c0/387c3/Ep2yViyy-zSPjzERcNnC3b48HPmp4XyKCDx70M-wLiQ.png","srcSet":"/static/d64abdee55fd5db8920de44218d879c0/06541/Ep2yViyy-zSPjzERcNnC3b48HPmp4XyKCDx70M-wLiQ.png 350w,\n/static/d64abdee55fd5db8920de44218d879c0/065b0/Ep2yViyy-zSPjzERcNnC3b48HPmp4XyKCDx70M-wLiQ.png 700w,\n/static/d64abdee55fd5db8920de44218d879c0/387c3/Ep2yViyy-zSPjzERcNnC3b48HPmp4XyKCDx70M-wLiQ.png 1400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/d64abdee55fd5db8920de44218d879c0/194c7/Ep2yViyy-zSPjzERcNnC3b48HPmp4XyKCDx70M-wLiQ.webp 350w,\n/static/d64abdee55fd5db8920de44218d879c0/e62d6/Ep2yViyy-zSPjzERcNnC3b48HPmp4XyKCDx70M-wLiQ.webp 700w,\n/static/d64abdee55fd5db8920de44218d879c0/e2891/Ep2yViyy-zSPjzERcNnC3b48HPmp4XyKCDx70M-wLiQ.webp 1400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":400}}}},"active":"FALSE","title":"Frankenreads","twitter_account":"frankenreads","twitter_hashtag":null,"year_start":2017,"month_start":7,"year_end":2018,"month_end":10,"participants":[{"name":"Kirsten Keister","affiliations":[{"title":"Designer","department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"start":2011,"end":2018,"person_group":null,"slug":"kirsten-keister","new_id":5},{"name":"Amanda French","affiliations":[{"title":"Independent Scholar","department":null,"institution":null}],"start":null,"end":null,"person_group":null,"slug":"amanda-french","new_id":199}],"directors":[{"name":"Neil Fraistat","affiliations":[{"title":"Professor","department":"Department of English","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"start":null,"end":null,"person_group":null,"slug":"neil-fraistat","new_id":22}],"links":[{"title":"Frankenreads Website","url":"http://frankenreads.org","type":"url"}],"sponsors":[{"name":"National Endowment for the Humanities","website":"neh.gov","type":"External","slug":"neh"},{"name":"Keats-Shelley Association of America","website":"k-saa.org","type":"External","slug":"k-sa"}],"partners":[],"events":[{"id":"all-day-frankenstein-reading-at-the-neh","event_title":"All-day Frankenstein Reading at the NEH","talk_title":null,"talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Other Event"],"start":"2018-10-31T04:00:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"National Endowment for the Humanities, 400 7th Street SW, Washington, DC"}],"posts":[],"disciplines":[{"term":"Literacy, composition, and creative writing","type":"Discipline"},{"term":"Literary studies","type":"Discipline"}],"methods":[{"term":"bibliographic analysis","type":"Method"},{"term":"crowdsourcing","type":"Method"}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
