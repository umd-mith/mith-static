In total, these partner libraries contain over 90% of all known relevant manuscripts.\nAs we expand the holdings of the S-GA, we are providing open and centralized access for the widely distributed manuscripts, making them viewable as pages both in the order in which they appear in the manuscript and in the linear sequence in which they appear in the work. Over time, we hope to present all known manuscripts for any given work of our four authors.\nThe innovative technical architecture of the S-GA builds on open standards and the principles of the linked data movement, and has been designed to support user curation in subsequent phases of the project. Rather than serving only as a point of access, the S-GA will thus function ultimately as a work-site for scholars, students, and the general public, whose contributions in the form of transcriptions, corrections, annotations, and TEI encoding will create a commons through which various discourse networks related to its texts intersect and interact. The more immediate goal for the S-GA’s current phase, however, is to provide access to page images under open licenses with fully encoded transcriptions for as many of these manuscripts as possible.\nFor more information on the project and for a full list of participants and sponsors <a href=\"http://www.shelleygodwinarchive.org\">visit the project website</a>.</p>"}},"researchExcerpt":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>The Shelley-Godwin Archive draws primarily from the Bodleian Library, Oxford, and the Carl H. Pforzheimer Collection of Shelley and His Circle at New York Public Library (NYPL), which together hold an estimated 90 percent of all known relevant manuscripts worldwide. MITH is creating the project's infrastructure with the assistance of the New York Public Library's digital humanities group, NYPL Labs.
