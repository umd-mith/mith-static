The theoretical approach she took in her dissertation later in the 80s was inspired by the work of her teacher, Donna Haraway, and her analyses of feminist primate researchers, although the methods she used were necessarily rather different in examining literary objects and became elements of her talk about feminism and writing technologies. King was particularly helped by Haraway’s transformations of the work of Bruno Latour and Steve Woolgar’s anthropology of the scientific laboratory in their book, Laboratory Life.\nKing’s <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20070609001807/http://www.mith.umd.edu/fellows/king/printshop.html\">Feminism and Writing Technologies</a> was an early MITH Faculty Fellow project which featured a virtual 17th-century Quaker women’s printshop designed to plumb more fully (by reconfiguring objects of study) the intertwinings of print and digital distributions of knowledge production and their implications for research in the twenty-first century university.</p>"}},"researchExcerpt":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>King's Feminism and Writing Technologies was an early MITH Faculty Fellow project which featured a virtual 17th-century Quaker women's printshop designed to plumb more fully (by reconfiguring objects of study) the intertwinings of print and digital distributions of knowledge production and their implications for research in the twenty-first century university.</p>"}},"image":null},"active":"FALSE","title":"Feminism and Writing Technologies","twitter_account":null,"twitter_hashtag":null,"year_start":2000,"month_start":1,"year_end":2000,"month_end":6,"participants":[],"directors":[{"name":"Katie King","affiliations":[{"title":"Resident Fellow (Women's Studies)","department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"start":2000,"end":2000,"person_group":null,"slug":"katie-king","new_id":135}],"links":[{"title":"Project Website as of 2007 (Wayback Machine)","url":"http://web.archive.org/web/20070609001807/http://www.mith.umd.edu/fellows/king/printshop.html","type":"url"}],"sponsors":[],"partners":[],"events":[],"posts":[],"disciplines":[{"term":"Feminist studies","type":"Discipline"},{"term":"Gender and sexuality studies","type":"Discipline"},{"term":"Informatics","type":"Discipline"}],"methods":[{"term":"digital research infrastructures development and analysis","type":"Method"},{"term":"electronic literature production and analysis","type":"Method"}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
