First, in the shorter term, rather than do full comprehensive justice to any one of the functions described above, we are really trying to “open the door” with respect to them all, encouraging different teams of faculty and student researches both at the University of Maryland and around the country and world to develop dynamic possibilities for this project.\nAnyone interested in the kind of scholarly and analytic priorities foregrounded by the project is most warmly encouraged to contact us with your ideas and to join our project. The second point is more long term: though this project does aim to offer the means for a wholesale remapping of American literary studies (what this domain consists of, which voices and texts, why they are important), it is also a project of significance not only among university and academic research communities but also in larger social domains of education as well—including not only secondary schools and undergraduate pedagogy and also those interested in non-traditional education forms in our culture and society generally.\nThis general goal of making a productive globalizing contribution to American education in the broadest possible terms is an ultimate aspiration for this project.\n<em>The technological infrastructure for this project has been supported in part by a generous grant from <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/\">Amazon Web Services</a>.</em></p>"}},"researchExcerpt":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Foreign Literatures in America (FLA) is a project devoted to the recovery and understanding of the significance of foreign authored literary works, as well as immigrant authored literary works, in the U.S. throughout U.S. history.
