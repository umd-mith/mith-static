Within Bamboo, MITH is leading Corpora Space. We are designing research environments where scholars may discover, analyze and curate digital texts across the 450 years of print culture in English from 1473 until 1923, along with the texts from the Classical world upon which that print culture is based. We are initially focusing on the following collections: AUSTLit; Nineteenth-century Scholarship Online (NINES); Google Books; HathiTrust; Oxford Text Archive; Perseus Digital Library; and Text Creation Partnership of Early English Books Online (EEBO) and Eighteenth Century Collections Online (ECCO).</p>"}},"researchExcerpt":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Project Bamboo was a partnership of ten research universities building shared infrastructure for humanities research.
