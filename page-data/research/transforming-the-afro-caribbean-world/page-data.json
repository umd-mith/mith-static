Ultimately this start-up grant will produce a work plan and report outlining a potential large-scale collaboration to map and explore the movement of Afro-Caribbean laborers between 1903 and 1920.</p>"}},"excerpt":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>The University of Maryland's Center for the History of the New America (CHNA) has partnered with MITH to develop the Transforming the
