Ultimately this start-up grant will produce a work plan and report outlining a potential large-scale collaboration to map and explore the movement of Afro-Caribbean laborers between 1903 and 1920.</p>"}},"researchExcerpt":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>The University of Maryland's Center for the History of the New America (CHNA) has partnered with MITH to develop the Transforming the Afro-Caribbean World (TAW) project to bring together scholars of the Panama Canal, Afro-Caribbean history, and experts in the digital humanities, data modeling, and visualization for a two-day planning workshop that will discuss a large-scale effort to explore Afro-Caribbean labor, migration, and the Panama Canal.</p>"}},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#e8d8d8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/82d2656ec07b5ca9b1d6c40046202fb1/72fd4/5_yU3xqQpnMqExecJcDy-iSA5QJiog-wZOZ0p0Heh1c.jpg","srcSet":"/static/82d2656ec07b5ca9b1d6c40046202fb1/4c69d/5_yU3xqQpnMqExecJcDy-iSA5QJiog-wZOZ0p0Heh1c.jpg 350w,\n/static/82d2656ec07b5ca9b1d6c40046202fb1/554a8/5_yU3xqQpnMqExecJcDy-iSA5QJiog-wZOZ0p0Heh1c.jpg 700w,\n/static/82d2656ec07b5ca9b1d6c40046202fb1/72fd4/5_yU3xqQpnMqExecJcDy-iSA5QJiog-wZOZ0p0Heh1c.jpg 1400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/82d2656ec07b5ca9b1d6c40046202fb1/194c7/5_yU3xqQpnMqExecJcDy-iSA5QJiog-wZOZ0p0Heh1c.webp 350w,\n/static/82d2656ec07b5ca9b1d6c40046202fb1/e62d6/5_yU3xqQpnMqExecJcDy-iSA5QJiog-wZOZ0p0Heh1c.webp 700w,\n/static/82d2656ec07b5ca9b1d6c40046202fb1/e2891/5_yU3xqQpnMqExecJcDy-iSA5QJiog-wZOZ0p0Heh1c.webp 1400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":400}}}},"active":"FALSE","title":"Transforming The Afro-Caribbean World","twitter_account":null,"twitter_hashtag":null,"year_start":2014,"month_start":9,"year_end":2015,"month_end":8,"participants":[{"name":"Trevor Mu√±oz","affiliations":[{"title":"Associate Director","department":"Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"start":2012,"end":2017,"person_group":["current"],"slug":"trevor-munoz","new_id":1},{"name":"Kirsten Keister","affiliations":[{"title":"Designer","department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"start":2011,"end":2018,"person_group":null,"slug":"kirsten-keister","new_id":5},{"name":"Julie Greene","affiliations":[{"title":"Professor","department":"Department of History","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"start":null,"end":null,"person_group":null,"slug":"julie-greene","new_id":289}],"directors":[{"name":"Jennifer Guiliano","affiliations":[{"title":"Assistant Director","department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"start":2011,"end":2014,"person_group":null,"slug":"jennifer-guiliano","new_id":24}],"links":[{"title":"Workshop Website","url":"http://umd-mith.github.io/taw_workshop/","type":"url"}],"sponsors":[{"name":"National Endowment for the Humanities","website":"neh.gov","type":"External","slug":"neh"}],"partners":[{"name":"Center for the History of the New America (CHNA)","website":null,"type":"External","slug":"chna"}],"events":[],"posts":[{"post_title":"Two New Start-Up Grants","author":"mith","author_name":"MITH ","post_date":"April 27, 2014","slug":"two-new-start-up-grants"}],"disciplines":[{"term":"Chicano/x, Latino/x studies","type":"Discipline"},{"term":"History","type":"Discipline"},{"term":"Humanities computing","type":"Discipline"}],"methods":[{"term":"data modeling","type":"Method"},{"term":"spatial & spatio-temporal analysis, modeling and visualization","type":"Method"}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
