Some of these spaces were hosted on Usenet, a decentralized, worldwide discussion system founded in 1980 and organized around topic-specific newsgroups. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet\">Usenet</a>, as a communications network, is an influential predecessor to modern social media platforms and the origin point for now-common bits of contemporary Internet vocabulary like \"spam.\"\nThese spaces offered transgender users the opportunity to communicate and find support, without falling into \"maladaptive\" coping strategies. The resulting archive is a record of online discussions in five important transgender-related forums:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Alt.transgendered;</li>\n<li>Soc.support.transgendered;</li>\n<li>Alt.support.srs;</li>\n<li>Alt.support.crossdressing; and</li>\n<li>alt.fashion.crossdressing.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Dame's research focuses on how posters use the term \"cisgender\" in their discussions. These groups are one of the few archival locations where participants regularly used the term, and several origin narratives point to different newsgroups as being the where it was first used. His larger dissertation explores the affective and structural meanings assigned to \"community\" in English-language transgender discourse online. Read more about Avery's research, methodologies, and the process of building the archive in the <a href=\"../../tag/transgender-usenet-archive/index.html\">blog posts</a> completed during his fellowship.\n<a href=\"http://transusenet.averydame.net/\">Users can access the archive here</a>, and can search for any single word or two word phrase.
