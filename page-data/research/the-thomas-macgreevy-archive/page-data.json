The project is committed to investigating the intersections between traditional humanities research and digital technologies. Begun with generous grants from The Newman Scholarship Fund at <a href=\"http://www.ucd.ie/\">University College Dublin</a> and <a href=\"http://www.enterprise-ireland.ie/english.asp\">Enterprise Ireland</a>, it partnered with The Intents Project at University College Dublin to develop intelligent search and navigation tools for hyper documents. It is published by the <a href=\"http://www.iath.virginia.edu/\">Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities</a>, at University of Virginia, and supported by the <a href=\"http://www.lib.umd.edu/\">University of Maryland Libraries</a>.\nThe original goal of publishing an on-line bibliography of writings by and about Thomas MacGreevy is nearly complete, with over 400 texts that can be browsed or searched in a variety of ways.\nWith this release, the Archive now features several new collections available through the browse mode, including Thomas MacGreevy Composing a Poem, an edition of several of MacGreevy’s poems that allows readers to trace their composition history; Thomas MacGreevy and Jack B Yeats: An Online Broadsheet, which explores MacGreevy’s and Yeats’s professional and personal relationship, and Who’s Who in the MacGreevy Archive, a database which provides authority files for the names of people and organisations found in the texts. Many of the entries contain biographical notes.\nThe Thomas MacGreevy Archive is fully XML-compliant, with texts encoded according to the <a href=\"http://tei-c.org/\">Text Encoding Initiative guidelines</a>. The Archive uses <a href=\"http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene\">Lucene</a> to deliver a majority of texts. The collection Thomas MacGreevy Composing a Poem utilises the <a href=\"http://v-machine.org/\">Versioning Machine</a>, open-source software developed at MITH.</p>"}},"researchExcerpt":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>The Thomas MacGreevy Archive is a long-term, interdisciplinary research project that explores the life, writings, and relationships of the Irish poet and critic, Thomas MacGreevy (1893-1967).
