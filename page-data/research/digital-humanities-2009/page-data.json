As a setting for digital humanities research, MITH also enjoys unusually close relationships with the campus’s iSchool or Information School, the Human-Computer Interaction Lab (the oldest of its kind), and the University Libraries, all of whom were co-sponsors of the conference.\nThe University of Maryland as a conference site put attendees within arm’s length of the capital of the United States and all its cultural institutions (including the Smithsonian, the Library of Congress, the Folger Shakespeare Library, and the Kennedy Center), countless dining options and cuisines from around the globe, and the nearby waterfronts of the Chesapeake Bay, Annapolis, and the city of Baltimore.\nExcursions and activities took full advantage of the wealth of opportunity the area provides, with special tours of the Smithsonian’s vaults or the National Archives, time on the National Mall, and a trip to the Air and Space museum’s recently opened Udvar-Hazy Center near Dulles International Airport (whose exhibits include the Space Shuttle Enterprise).</p>"}},"excerpt":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Digital Humanities 2009-the annual joint meeting of the Association for Computers and
