It is the most authoritative source for the influence on non-Jewish culture upon Jewish culture during the Middle Ages. Although unrivaled and unsurpassed, Steinschneiderâ€™s work is dated and in need of revision. The Steinschneider Bibliographical Database (SBD) includes a translation and ongoing update of HU, a comprehensive list of extant manuscripts in the relevant areas with pictures of the first folios of each manuscript, selected English translations (where available and permission is attainable), and links to further information. All the materials of the SBD is available for scholars digitally.\nWhile the SBD is geared primarily for scholars, it will have immediate pedagogic value in college courses and for Jewish high schools. Using the SBD, this project hopes to kindle interest among high school and college students in the study of the history of science and philosophy among the Jews.</p>"}},"researchExcerpt":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>The Steinschneider Bibliographic Database is a digitized relational database for the study of pre-modern Jewish philosophy, science, and belles-lettres, based on the standard reference-work, Die Hebraeischen Ubersetzungen des Mittelalters und dir Juden als Dolmetscher (The Hebrew Translations of the Middle Ages and the Jews as Interpreters, henceforth HU).</p>"}},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#986828","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/521809729228df47b8803119f66f05c3/b04d5/PJ6YS849WMUY-Z8_pgRi-IDNHBbL_7uNJOFycI3DlSI.jpg","srcSet":"/static/521809729228df47b8803119f66f05c3/7e2c2/PJ6YS849WMUY-Z8_pgRi-IDNHBbL_7uNJOFycI3DlSI.jpg 350w,\n/static/521809729228df47b8803119f66f05c3/5c92b/PJ6YS849WMUY-Z8_pgRi-IDNHBbL_7uNJOFycI3DlSI.jpg 700w,\n/static/521809729228df47b8803119f66f05c3/b04d5/PJ6YS849WMUY-Z8_pgRi-IDNHBbL_7uNJOFycI3DlSI.jpg 1400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/521809729228df47b8803119f66f05c3/4d5cc/PJ6YS849WMUY-Z8_pgRi-IDNHBbL_7uNJOFycI3DlSI.webp 350w,\n/static/521809729228df47b8803119f66f05c3/1ddfc/PJ6YS849WMUY-Z8_pgRi-IDNHBbL_7uNJOFycI3DlSI.webp 700w,\n/static/521809729228df47b8803119f66f05c3/48687/PJ6YS849WMUY-Z8_pgRi-IDNHBbL_7uNJOFycI3DlSI.webp 1400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":220}}}},"active":"FALSE","title":"Steinschneider Bibliographic Database","twitter_account":null,"twitter_hashtag":null,"year_start":2002,"month_start":9,"year_end":2004,"month_end":6,"participants":[{"name":"Doug Reside","affiliations":[{"title":"Assistant Director","department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"start":2005,"end":2010,"person_group":null,"slug":"douglas-reside","new_id":29},{"name":"Gregory Lord","affiliations":[{"title":"Web Designer & Software Engineer","department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"start":2005,"end":2010,"person_group":null,"slug":"gregory-lord","new_id":53},{"name":"Abhishta Paranjpe","affiliations":[{"title":"Program Associate","department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"start":2005,"end":2007,"person_group":null,"slug":"abhishta-paranjpe","new_id":70},{"name":"Andrew Matusko","affiliations":[{"title":"Program Associate","department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"start":2006,"end":2007,"person_group":null,"slug":"andrew-matusko","new_id":69}],"directors":[{"name":"Chip Manekin","affiliations":[{"title":"Resident Fellow","department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"start":2004,"end":2006,"person_group":null,"slug":"charles-manekin","new_id":138}],"links":[{"title":"Project Website","url":"http://mith.umd.edu/steinschneider/","type":"url"}],"sponsors":[],"partners":[],"events":[{"id":"fellows-presentations-2","event_title":"David Prager Branner, Chip Manekin Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Fellows Presentations","talk_subtitle":"David Prager Branner and Chip Manekin","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2006-04-25T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2006-04-25T17:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room"}],"posts":[{"post_title":"4/25 Digital Dialogue: David Prager Branner and Chip Manekin","author":"digital-dialogues","author_name":"Digital Dialogues","post_date":"April 19, 2006","slug":"april-25th-digital-dialogue-david-prager-branner-and-chip-manekin"}],"disciplines":[{"term":"History","type":"Discipline"}],"methods":[{"term":"cultural analytics","type":"Method"},{"term":"database creation, management, and analysis","type":"Method"}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
