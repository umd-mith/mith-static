AXE, the first item in MITH’s proposed toolkit for the digital humanities, is a web-based tool for “tagging” text, video, audio, and image files with XML metadata, a process that is now a necessary but onerous first step in the production of digital material. With an intuitive, web-based interface, AXE makes this process more efficient and accurate. It also facilitates collaboration in the digital humanities by permitting multiple scholars to work on the same document or archive at the same time from various locations, and tracks all work so that variant versions can be collated and all versions can be archived. The open source AXE provides a free and improved alternative to existing software for tagging all kinds of digital content in an increasingly web-based and multi-medial digital environment.</p>"}},"researchExcerpt":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>AXE is a web-based tool for \"tagging\" text, video, audio, and image files with XML metadata, a process that is now a necessary but onerous first step in the production of digital material.</p>"}},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/58afd311db5a41f4e4b4b995af903d61/bd613/ZbXE2lEmFVfUtHf6AYaD3xkYlQ9hGaYhOe_sT9Zz8KE.png","srcSet":"/static/58afd311db5a41f4e4b4b995af903d61/ad653/ZbXE2lEmFVfUtHf6AYaD3xkYlQ9hGaYhOe_sT9Zz8KE.png 350w,\n/static/58afd311db5a41f4e4b4b995af903d61/ddf2e/ZbXE2lEmFVfUtHf6AYaD3xkYlQ9hGaYhOe_sT9Zz8KE.png 700w,\n/static/58afd311db5a41f4e4b4b995af903d61/bd613/ZbXE2lEmFVfUtHf6AYaD3xkYlQ9hGaYhOe_sT9Zz8KE.png 1400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/58afd311db5a41f4e4b4b995af903d61/b0193/ZbXE2lEmFVfUtHf6AYaD3xkYlQ9hGaYhOe_sT9Zz8KE.webp 350w,\n/static/58afd311db5a41f4e4b4b995af903d61/ea9e1/ZbXE2lEmFVfUtHf6AYaD3xkYlQ9hGaYhOe_sT9Zz8KE.webp 700w,\n/static/58afd311db5a41f4e4b4b995af903d61/1f8a0/ZbXE2lEmFVfUtHf6AYaD3xkYlQ9hGaYhOe_sT9Zz8KE.webp 1400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":340.00000000000006}}}},"active":"FALSE","title":"Ajax XML Encoder (AXE)","twitter_account":null,"twitter_hashtag":null,"year_start":2007,"month_start":8,"year_end":2009,"month_end":1,"participants":[{"name":"Gregory Lord","affiliations":[{"title":"Web Designer & Software Engineer","department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"start":2005,"end":2010,"person_group":null,"slug":"gregory-lord","new_id":53},{"name":"Grant Dickie","affiliations":[{"title":"Web Programmer","department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"start":2012,"end":2012,"person_group":null,"slug":"grant-dickie","new_id":48}],"directors":[{"name":"Doug Reside","affiliations":[{"title":"Associate Director","department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"start":2010,"end":2011,"person_group":null,"slug":"douglas-reside","new_id":29}],"links":[{"title":"Final Performance Report","url":"http://hdl.handle.net/1903/14729","type":"url"}],"sponsors":[],"partners":[],"events":[],"posts":[{"post_title":"MITH Receives NEH Digital Humanities Start-Up Grant","author":"mith","author_name":"MITH ","post_date":"August 14, 2007","slug":"mith-receives-neh-digital-humanities-start-up-grant"},{"post_title":"Annual MITH Update Letter","author":"mith","author_name":"MITH ","post_date":"August 28, 2008","slug":"annual-mith-update-letter"},{"post_title":"Fall 2008 Digital Dialogues Schedule Posted","author":"digital-dialogues","author_name":"Digital Dialogues","post_date":"September 4, 2008","slug":"fall-2008-digital-dialogues-schedule-posted"},{"post_title":"MITH's TILE Project Funded by NEH Preservation and Access","author":"mith","author_name":"MITH ","post_date":"March 26, 2009","slug":"miths-tile-project-funded-by-neh-preservation-and-access"},{"post_title":"Congratulations to Doug Reside!","author":"neil-fraistat","author_name":"Neil Fraistat","post_date":"December 14, 2010","slug":"congratulations-to-doug-reside"},{"post_title":"9/9 MITH Digitial Dialogue: Doug Reside","author":"digital-dialogues","author_name":"Digital Dialogues","post_date":"September 2, 2008","slug":"september-9th-digitial-dialogue-doug-reside-the-mithological-axe-multimedia-metadata-encoding-with-the-ajax-xml-encoder"}],"disciplines":[{"term":"Informatics","type":"Discipline"}],"methods":[{"term":"digital archiving","type":"Method"},{"term":"metadata standards, systems, and methods","type":"Method"}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
