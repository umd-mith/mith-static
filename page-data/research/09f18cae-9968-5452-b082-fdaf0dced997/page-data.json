All three productions were grouped together under the overall title “Beckett Directs Beckett.” As such they toured throughout Europe and in some parts of Asia to wide acclaim. Furthermore, each time a new tour was organized for these productions, after sometimes lengthy lacunae, Beckett has, with the assistance of Walter Asmus, and/or Alan Mandell, brought them back to performance level.\nThough the initial productions as staged in 1985 already brought forth substantial changes in the published acting texts of the plays, each time a re-mounting of the productions occurred additional changes were made. The same was true during the production period for these television versions, with Beckett sometimes making textual changes on the telephone even as a given scene was being taped. For these productions, it was our intention and design to open them out beyond the confines of the stage in order to accommodate them to the television medium. Walter Asmus and Alan Mandell, both of whom enjoyed the author’s complete confidence, were responsible for this part of the endeavor.</p>"}},"researchExcerpt":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Photographs, video clips, and other media documenting the 1985 television productions of Beckett's \"Waiting for Godot\" and \"Krapp's Last Tape\".</p>"}},"image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/e51842434cb8edede1eebbf48f93674d/387c3/iGTMOC5dixluGdhW0iLT9x570I8XbZBak0oxp9zYQzg.png","srcSet":"/static/e51842434cb8edede1eebbf48f93674d/06541/iGTMOC5dixluGdhW0iLT9x570I8XbZBak0oxp9zYQzg.png 350w,\n/static/e51842434cb8edede1eebbf48f93674d/065b0/iGTMOC5dixluGdhW0iLT9x570I8XbZBak0oxp9zYQzg.png 700w,\n/static/e51842434cb8edede1eebbf48f93674d/387c3/iGTMOC5dixluGdhW0iLT9x570I8XbZBak0oxp9zYQzg.png 1400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/e51842434cb8edede1eebbf48f93674d/194c7/iGTMOC5dixluGdhW0iLT9x570I8XbZBak0oxp9zYQzg.webp 350w,\n/static/e51842434cb8edede1eebbf48f93674d/e62d6/iGTMOC5dixluGdhW0iLT9x570I8XbZBak0oxp9zYQzg.webp 700w,\n/static/e51842434cb8edede1eebbf48f93674d/e2891/iGTMOC5dixluGdhW0iLT9x570I8XbZBak0oxp9zYQzg.webp 1400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":400}}}},"active":"FALSE","title":"Beckett Directs Beckett","twitter_account":null,"twitter_hashtag":null,"year_start":2000,"month_start":1,"year_end":2001,"month_end":12,"participants":[],"directors":[{"name":"Mitch Lifton","affiliations":[{"title":"Resident Fellow (Faculty/Comparative Literature)","department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"start":2000,"end":2001,"person_group":null,"slug":"mitch-lifton","new_id":137}],"links":[{"title":"Project Website","url":"http://mith.umd.edu/beckett/","type":"url"}],"sponsors":[],"partners":[],"events":[],"posts":[],"disciplines":[{"term":"Design studies","type":"Discipline"},{"term":"Performance Studies: Dance, Theatre","type":"Discipline"}],"methods":[{"term":"digital archiving","type":"Method"}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
