A significant component of such work has been the study of theatre architecture. The Theatre Architecture working group of the International Federation for Theatre Research has begun to examine the ways in which architecture can establish audience expectations, and enhance or limit an audience's experience of a performance.\nLittle attempt has been made, however, to apply these approaches to historic theatre buildings, in large part because of the prohibitive costs of locating and traveling to structures scattered around the world. Theatre Finder is an attempt create the necessary finding aid for these buildings and provide a consistent body of relevant data for them, with digital reconstructions at a consistent scale.</p>"}},"excerpt":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Theatre Finder is a collaboratively edited, peer reviewed, online database of historic theatre architecture from the Minoan \"theatrical areas\" on the island of Crete, to the last theatre built before 1815.</p>"}},"image":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#d8c8b8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/834941a5d3d260d56f58dc4b3352ce4c/13c26/header_theatrefinder..jpg","srcSet":"/static/834941a5d3d260d56f58dc4b3352ce4c/f859d/header_theatrefinder..jpg 350w,\n/static/834941a5d3d260d56f58dc4b3352ce4c/109af/header_theatrefinder..jpg 700w,\n/static/834941a5d3d260d56f58dc4b3352ce4c/13c26/header_theatrefinder..jpg 1400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/834941a5d3d260d56f58dc4b3352ce4c/41980/header_theatrefinder..webp 350w,\n/static/834941a5d3d260d56f58dc4b3352ce4c/47399/header_theatrefinder..webp 700w,\n/static/834941a5d3d260d56f58dc4b3352ce4c/8e19d/header_theatrefinder..webp 1400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":400}}}]},"active":"FALSE","title":"Theatre Finder","twitter_account":null,"year_end":2011,"year_start":2009,"month_start":9,"month_end":6,"linked_participants":[{"data":{"name":"Travis Brown","slug":"travis-brown","new_id":25,"group_type":["Past","External"],"id":"travis-brown","affiliations":[{"data":{"title":"Research & Development Software Developer","institution":"University of Maryland","department":"MITH","end":2012,"start":2011,"person_name":["Travis Brown"],"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"travis-brown"}}]}}]}},{"data":{"name":"Elisabeth Kvernen","slug":"elisabeth-kvernen","new_id":54,"group_type":["Past"],"id":"elisabeth-kvernen","affiliations":[{"data":{"title":"Web Designer","institution":"University of Maryland","department":"MITH","end":2011,"start":2009,"person_name":["Elisabeth Kvernen"],"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"elisabeth-kvernen"}}]}}]}}],"linked_internal_participant_affiliations":[{"data":{"title":"Research & Development Software Developer","institution":"University of Maryland","department":"MITH","end":2012,"start":2011,"person_name":["Travis Brown"],"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"travis-brown"}}]}},{"data":{"title":"Web Designer","institution":"University of Maryland","department":"MITH","end":2011,"start":2009,"person_name":["Elisabeth Kvernen"],"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"elisabeth-kvernen"}}]}},{"data":{"title":"Designer","institution":"University of Maryland","department":"MITH","end":2018,"start":2011,"person_name":["Kirsten Keister"],"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"kirsten-keister"}}]}}],"linked_external_participant_affiliations":null,"linked_directors":[{"data":{"name":"Franklin J.
