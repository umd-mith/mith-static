These records were stored on old punch-cards known as McBee edge-notched cards. Their goal was to get all these cards entered into a grants database by 2015, which was the NEH's 50th anniversary. In September of 2015, the NEH completed and announced the project. For the first time ever, the public could search for any grant the NEH had ever made. <em>Time</em> magazine ran a story in which they featured ten of the old McBee cards.\nOne of these cards described a grant to Andy van Dam at Brown University in 1974. The title was \"An Experiment in Computer Based Education Using Hypertext.\" The brief description on the card simply said:\n<em>To support an experimental program to teach a college-level English poetry course, utilizing a new form of computer based \"manuscript,\" called a hypertext. A documentary film about the project is being produced. An evaluation is being performed to determine the usefulness of this technique as an aid to humanities education.</em>\nThe short film that resulted is an early and remarkable document of the kind of collaboration between humanities scholars and students and computer scientists that is increasingly commonplace in the field known as Digital Humanities. It has not been shown in public since its making.\nThe Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities and the <a href=\"http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/about/\">Human-Computer Interaction Lab</a> at the University of Maryland, and the <a href=\"http://www.neh.gov/divisions/odh\">National Endowment for the Humanities</a> cordially invite you to its first public screening at <strong>7:30pm on the evening of Monday April 25, 2016</strong> in the auditorium at 0320 Tawes Hall. The screening will include commentary on this experiment, which built arguably the first online scholarly community, by Professor van Dam, followed by a panel discussion featuring van Dam as well as Maryland's own Ben Shneiderman, Kari Kraus (Associate Professor, iSchool and English Department), the NEH's CIO and Director of the Office of Digital Humanities Brett Bobley, and NEH's Program Analyst Ann Sneesby-Koch (to be moderated by MITH's Associate Director Matthew Kirschenbaum).\nWe hope that you can join us for this very special event!\n<em>Andy Van Dam will also be joining us for a special Digital Dialogue talk the following Tuesday afternoon, April 26th. <a href=\"../../dialogues/dd-spring-2016-andy-van-dam/index.html\">Click here for details.</a></em>\n<a href=\"http://neh.gov\"
