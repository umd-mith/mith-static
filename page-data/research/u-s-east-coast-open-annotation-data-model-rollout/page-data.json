This series of meetings is made possible by generous funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.\nThese day-long public rollouts informed digital humanities and sciences computing developers, curators of digital collections, and scholars using digital content about the W3C Open Annotation Community Group’s work. Topics included the Open Annotation Data Model, the W3C Open Annotation Community Group, existing implementations of Open Annotation producers and consumers, and developer tools and resources.\nAt the U.S. East Coast Rollout in May, MITH presented its <a href=\"http://umd-mith.github.com/OACVideoAnnotator/\">video annotation developer toolkit</a> developed in conjunction with <a href=\"http://alexanderstreet.com/\">Alexander Street Press</a>. The toolkit provides a JavaScript framework for creating and viewing annotations of video embedded in a web page without having access to the video stream, enabling annotation of proprietary video. MITH also outlined its ongoing work developing a Drupal module that uses this toolkit to enable annotation of video embedded in a website.</p>"}},"excerpt":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>The Open Annotation Data Model Rollouts were a series of three meetings organized by the members of the Open Annotation Consortium and Annotation Ontology to introduce the Open Annotation Data Model Community Specification developed through their collaboration as the W3C Open Annotation Community Group.
