We are particularly interested, through this meeting and through follow on activities, in topics such as broadening the constituencies for black digital collections, ownership and agency in shared collections, as well as beginning and sustaining collaborations.\n<a href=\"https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:21919/\">View Report</a></p>"}},"excerpt":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Together Umbra Search African American History and the African American History, Culture, and Digital Humanities (AADHum) initiative at the University of Maryland organized a working meeting on digital collections and platforms focused on African American history and culture.</p>"}},"image":null,"active":"FALSE","title":"Umbra Search and the Future of Black Digital Platforms Pre-Conference","twitter_account":null,"year_end":2018,"year_start":2018,"month_start":9,"month_end":10,"linked_participants":null,"linked_internal_participant_affiliations":null,"linked_external_participant_affiliations":null,"linked_directors":[{"data":{"name":"Trevor  Muñoz","group_type":["Staff","External"],"slug":"trevor-munoz","new_id":1,"id":"trevor-munoz"}},{"data":{"name":"Cecily  Marcus","group_type":[],"slug":"cecily-marcus","new_id":563,"id":"cecily-marcus"}}],"linked_director_affiliations":[{"data":{"title":"Interim Director","department":"Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities","institution":"University of Maryland","start":2017,"end":2020,"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"trevor-munoz"}}]}},{"data":{"title":"Curator","department":"Archives & Special Collections","institution":"University of Minnesota","start":null,"end":null,"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"cecily-marcus"}}]}}],"linked_links":null,"linked_sponsors":null,"linked_partners":[{"data":{"name":"Umbra Search African American History","website":null,"type":"External","slug":"usaah"}}],"linked_events":null,"linked_posts":[{"data":{"post_title":"Help Shape a Conversation About Black Digital Collections at #AADHum2018","author":"trevor-munoz","author_name":"Trevor Muñoz","post_date":"October 8, 2018","slug":"help-shape-a-conversation-about-black-digital-collections-at-aadhum2018"}},{"data":{"post_title":"Archives in the Anthropocene","author":"purdom-lindblad","author_name":"Purdom Lindblad","post_date":"March 20, 2018","slug":"archives-in-the-anthropocene"}},{"data":{"post_title":"Announcing the 'Race, Space, and Place' sequence of Spring 2017 AADHum Events!","author":"mith","author_name":"MITH ","post_date":"January 30, 2017","slug":"announcing-race-space-place-sequence-spring-2017-aadhum-events"}},{"data":{"post_title":"Jobs: Postdoctoral Positions in Digital Humanities and African American History and Culture","author":"mith","author_name":"MITH ","post_date":"June 30, 2016","slug":"aadhum-postdocs"}}],"disciplines":[{"data":{"name":"African and African American Studies","method_or_discipline":"Discipline"}},{"data":{"name":"Cultural studies","method_or_discipline":"Discipline"}},{"data":{"name":"History","method_or_discipline":"Discipline"}},{"data":{"name":"Informatics","method_or_discipline":"Discipline"}}],"methods":[{"data":{"name":"digital activism and advocacy","method_or_discipline":"Method"}},{"data":{"name":"meta-criticism (reflections on digital humanities and humanities computing)","method_or_discipline":"Method"}}],"directors":[{"data":{"name":"Trevor  Muñoz","group_type":["Staff","External"],"slug":"trevor-munoz","new_id":1,"id":"trevor-munoz"},"affiliations":[{"data":{"title":"Interim Director","department":"Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities","institution":"University of Maryland","start":2017,"end":2020,"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"trevor-munoz"}}]}}]},{"data":{"name":"Cecily  Marcus","group_type":[],"slug":"cecily-marcus","new_id":563,"id":"cecily-marcus"},"affiliations":[{"data":{"title":"Curator","department":"Archives & Special Collections","institution":"University of Minnesota","start":null,"end":null,"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"cecily-marcus"}}]}}]}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["196133661","2857345991"],"slicesMap":{}}
