We intend, as we develop an OCR correction system designed to create opportunities for users to improve the system and not just the text itself, to examine how explorations of a users' preferences can improve their engagement with corpora of materials.\n<em>The technological infrastructure for this project has been supported in part by a generous grant from <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/\">Amazon Web Services</a>.</em></p>"}},"excerpt":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Active OCR: Tightening the Loop in Human Computing for OCR Correction will develop a proof-of-concept application that will experiment with the use of active learning and other iterative techniques for the correction of eighteenth-century texts.</p>"}},"image":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/45728eb233f0da0969ccd8b50164a26f/86e81/header_activeocr..png","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/45728eb233f0da0969ccd8b50164a26f/a03af/header_activeocr..png 350w,\n/mith-static/static/45728eb233f0da0969ccd8b50164a26f/d1257/header_activeocr..png 700w,\n/mith-static/static/45728eb233f0da0969ccd8b50164a26f/86e81/header_activeocr..png 1400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/45728eb233f0da0969ccd8b50164a26f/d4aaa/header_activeocr..webp 350w,\n/mith-static/static/45728eb233f0da0969ccd8b50164a26f/f5e64/header_activeocr..webp 700w,\n/mith-static/static/45728eb233f0da0969ccd8b50164a26f/2b2e8/header_activeocr..webp 1400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":282}}}]},"active":"FALSE","title":"Active OCR","twitter_account":null,"year_end":2014,"year_start":2012,"month_start":6,"month_end":5,"linked_participants":[{"data":{"name":"Paul  Evans","slug":"paul-evans","new_id":116,"group_type":["Past"],"id":"paul-evans"}}],"linked_internal_participant_affiliations":[{"data":{"title":"Research Assistant (Active OCR)","institution":"University of Maryland","department":"MITH","end":2013,"start":2011,"person_name":["Paul  Evans"],"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"paul-evans"}}]}}],"linked_external_participant_affiliations":null,"linked_directors":[{"data":{"name":"Travis  Brown","group_type":["Past","External"],"slug":"travis-brown","new_id":25,"id":"travis-brown"}}],"linked_director_affiliations":[{"data":{"title":"Research & Development Software Developer","department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland","start":2011,"end":2012,"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"travis-brown"}}]}}],"linked_links":[{"data":{"type":"url","url":"https://github.com/umd-mith/activeocr","title":"Code Repository"}}],"linked_sponsors":[{"data":{"name":"National Endowment for the Humanities","website":"neh.gov","type":"External","slug":"neh"}},{"data":{"name":"Amazon Web Services","website":"aws.amazon.com","type":"External","slug":"aws"}}],"linked_partners":null,"linked_events":null,"linked_posts":[{"data":{"post_title":"OCR, XML, Topic Modeling, and Braille Accessibility: Coming Soon Thanks to the NEH!","author":"mith","author_name":"MITH ","post_date":"March 21, 2012","slug":"ocr-xml-topic-modeling-and-braille-accessibility-coming-soon-thanks-to-the-neh"}}],"disciplines":[{"data":{"name":"Humanities computing","method_or_discipline":"Discipline"}}],"methods":[{"data":{"name":"mobile applications development and analysis","method_or_discipline":"Method"}}],"participants":[{"data":{"name":"Paul  Evans","slug":"paul-evans","new_id":116,"group_type":["Past"],"id":"paul-evans"},"affiliations":[{"data":{"title":"Research Assistant (Active OCR)","institution":"University of Maryland","department":"MITH","end":2013,"start":2011,"person_name":["Paul  Evans"],"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"paul-evans"}}]}}]}],"directors":[{"data":{"name":"Travis  Brown","group_type":["Past","External"],"slug":"travis-brown","new_id":25,"id":"travis-brown"},"affiliations":[{"data":{"title":"Research & Development Software Developer","department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland","start":2011,"end":2012,"linked_person":[{"data":{"id":"travis-brown"}}]}}]}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["196133661","2857345991"],"slicesMap":{}}
