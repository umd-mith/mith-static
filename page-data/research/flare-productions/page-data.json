One film in this series, <em>They Dreamed Tomorrow</em>, was produced in 2001 as a MITH Faculty Fellowship project wherein Fuegi and Francis produced a film, website, and DVD chronicling the contributions of Ada, Countess Lovelace (1815-1852), Lord Byron’s daughter, and Charles Babbage (1791-1871) to the early history of computing. The documentary focused on the woman for whom the United States Department of Defense named its programming language ADA and whose image Microsoft uses as its watermark. <em>To Dream Tomorrow</em> was featured in <a href=\"http://www.neh.gov/humanities/2003/januaryfebruary/feature/the-amazing-adding-subtracting-composing-creating-do\">NEH’s Humanities magazine (January/February 2003)</a>.\nJohn and Jo currently serve respectively as President/Treasurer and Vice President/Secretary of the Board of Directors, whose present members are Catherine Good Abbott, Ursula Daniels, Kathryn Maleney, Martha Nell Smith, and Emma Lew Thomas.
