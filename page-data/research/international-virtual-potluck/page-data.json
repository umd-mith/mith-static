The project was featured in an April 2000 Washington Post story entitled ‘<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/2000/04/09/virtual-education-101/0ff21ec7-9546-427a-b6c3-07eb1fc7731d/\">Virtual Education 101</a>.’ The ICLC comprised one website which initially supported four web-based distance courses: Diversity in American Cultures, Cross-Cultural Communication, and two courses in English for speakers of other languages from the Maryland English Institute. The four courses were also planned to be linked for some activities in a multiple-course environment. The site contained many pedagogical features including chat, threaded conferences, space for individual and collaborative projects, readings and other resources.</p>"}},"researchExcerpt":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>This was a MITH Fellows Project of American Studies professor Jo Paoletti.
