Neither tend properly to the dirty environmental effects of our digital technologies, and I argue, by situating the digital as an affective (humanist) or algorithmic (machinic) artifact, both actually perform de-materializing abstractions that perpetuate the neglect of concrete environmental thinking in the field. Though digital thinking is punctuated by terms like ‘wirelessness,’ ‘the Cloud,’ and notions of immateriality, the truth of course is that our digital network has a very real physical footprint, and even our google searches and spam emails have a carbon output.\nThis presentation responds to Maxwell and Miller’s call for a <em>deep ecological materiality</em> by introducing a metabolic relational ontology that orients the digital network and digital media as constitutive parts of today’s bio- and geo-material metabolisms. The digital network of connected things and connective infrastructure—the_ technosphere_, as so called by Environmental Engineer Peter Haff—is now profoundly entangled with Anthropogenic environmental concerns, and digital studies has a role to play in creating new narratives to capture these emerging relations. Indeed, the Anthropocene prompts us to re-story our digital theory so as to include its full implications—from mineral mining to e-waste and all the energy use, labor exploitation, and pollution in between—in the digital stories we tell.\nThis presentation proposes a method for moving media theory from a praxis grounded in computation to one fully rooted in the earth. It explores how we might infuse digital humanities practice, be it artistic or more research based, with a necessary environmental sensitivity in order to enact deeper engagements with our digital metabolic entanglements.</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Amanda Starling Gould Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"(POSTPONED) Dirty Digital Environmental Humanities","talk_subtitle":"From iPhones to eWaste","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2017-03-14T16:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"name":"Amanda Starling Gould","affiliations":[{"title":"PhD Candidate","department":null,"institution":"Duke University"}],"website":"https://amandastarlinggould.com","twitter":"stargould","slug":"amanda-starling-gould","new_id":377,"headshot":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/7c227ca5649591d7b49270bb02f2ad2c/b6e06/Uc13akbJAD490PssOrmfw_MsamzMruZ3rCyy_yCBiVE.jpg","srcSet":"/static/7c227ca5649591d7b49270bb02f2ad2c/a0f6e/Uc13akbJAD490PssOrmfw_MsamzMruZ3rCyy_yCBiVE.jpg 60w,\n/static/7c227ca5649591d7b49270bb02f2ad2c/24a7e/Uc13akbJAD490PssOrmfw_MsamzMruZ3rCyy_yCBiVE.jpg 120w,\n/static/7c227ca5649591d7b49270bb02f2ad2c/b6e06/Uc13akbJAD490PssOrmfw_MsamzMruZ3rCyy_yCBiVE.jpg 239w","sizes":"(min-width: 239px) 239px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/7c227ca5649591d7b49270bb02f2ad2c/f39b6/Uc13akbJAD490PssOrmfw_MsamzMruZ3rCyy_yCBiVE.webp 60w,\n/static/7c227ca5649591d7b49270bb02f2ad2c/df215/Uc13akbJAD490PssOrmfw_MsamzMruZ3rCyy_yCBiVE.webp 120w,\n/static/7c227ca5649591d7b49270bb02f2ad2c/02e1f/Uc13akbJAD490PssOrmfw_MsamzMruZ3rCyy_yCBiVE.webp 239w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 239px) 239px, 100vw"}]},"width":239,"height":225}}},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Amanda Starling Gould, PhD is the Digital Humanities Specialist / Special Projects Coordinator for the Franklin Humanities Institute (FHI) at Duke University.
