Composed at Bell Labs, in collaboration with engineers, and written in an early version of FORTRAN, <em>Etude</em> stands as one of the earliest works of digital art_—_although it is not entirely clear whether <em>Etude</em> was, in fact, the “computer opera” that Paik mentions elsewhere in his writings, or another artwork altogether. By exploring <em>Etude</em>’s uncertain status, as well as the piece’s more conceptual indeterminacies—between image and code, analog and digital, and film and music—this paper demonstrates how such indefinite artifacts allow for a rethinking of the nature of the archive, cinema’s digital past, and film’s place in computational media.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Gregory Zinman Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Nam June Paik’s Etude and the Indeterminate Origins of Digital Media Art","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2016-10-18T16:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Gregory Zinman","website":"https://gregzinman.wordpress.com","twitter":"gregzinman","slug":"gregory-zinman","new_id":435,"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#282828","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/885847e6bb8becabd4d8dd77bb0d3bd7/b0f91/Gregory-Zinman-e1470260926906..jpg","srcSet":"/static/885847e6bb8becabd4d8dd77bb0d3bd7/d71cc/Gregory-Zinman-e1470260926906..jpg 67w,\n/static/885847e6bb8becabd4d8dd77bb0d3bd7/c3b86/Gregory-Zinman-e1470260926906..jpg 135w,\n/static/885847e6bb8becabd4d8dd77bb0d3bd7/b0f91/Gregory-Zinman-e1470260926906..jpg 269w","sizes":"(min-width: 269px) 269px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/885847e6bb8becabd4d8dd77bb0d3bd7/536da/Gregory-Zinman-e1470260926906..webp 67w,\n/static/885847e6bb8becabd4d8dd77bb0d3bd7/88ccf/Gregory-Zinman-e1470260926906..webp 135w,\n/static/885847e6bb8becabd4d8dd77bb0d3bd7/fa202/Gregory-Zinman-e1470260926906..webp 269w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 269px) 269px, 100vw"}]},"width":269,"height":321}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"department":null,"institution":"Georgia Institute of Technology","title":"Assistant Professor of of Literature, Media, and Communication","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"gregory-zinman"}}]}}]}}],"linked_links":[{"data":{"id":228,"title":"Storify Link","url":"https://storify.com/digdialog/gregory-zinman-digital-dialogue-october-18-2016","type":"file_link"}}],"video_id":"187886680","video_url":"https://vimeo.com/187886680","livestream":null,"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"department":null,"institution":"Georgia Institute of Technology","title":"Assistant Professor of of Literature, Media, and Communication","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"gregory-zinman"}}]}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
