Why should we worry? These questions, among others, are asked by SIVA VAIDHYANATHAN, Professor of Media Studies at the University of Virginia, in his recently published tome <em>The Googlization of Everything — and Why We Should Worry</em>.

Despite proclaiming cultural sensitivity, Google engages in a “one-size-fits-all” model of privacy — and the defaults are always set to Google’s advantage.\nIn addition to discussing his book, Dr. Vaidhyanathan will introduce the notion of “infrastructural imperialism” to describe how Google goes about managing its relations with users and states around the world.</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Siva Vaidhyanathan Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"The Googlization of Surveillance","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2011-05-03T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2011-05-03T17:45:00.000Z","location":"Special Events Room, McKeldin Library","speakers":[{"name":"Siva Vaidhyanathan","affiliations":[{"title":"Professor of Media Studies","department":null,"institution":"University of Virginia"}],"website":null,"twitter":"sivavaid","slug":"siva-vaidhyanathan","new_id":529,"headshot":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#282828","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/f75fe0eb1f79464badd2e4fb29677e2e/cdddd/FF8zlVMqo0t5Daj-8z3Vbtw7eD6ubbro6ABm2AnfcJM.jpg","srcSet":"/static/f75fe0eb1f79464badd2e4fb29677e2e/c61c3/FF8zlVMqo0t5Daj-8z3Vbtw7eD6ubbro6ABm2AnfcJM.jpg 75w,\n/static/f75fe0eb1f79464badd2e4fb29677e2e/fa2a5/FF8zlVMqo0t5Daj-8z3Vbtw7eD6ubbro6ABm2AnfcJM.jpg 150w,\n/static/f75fe0eb1f79464badd2e4fb29677e2e/cdddd/FF8zlVMqo0t5Daj-8z3Vbtw7eD6ubbro6ABm2AnfcJM.jpg 300w","sizes":"(min-width: 300px) 300px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/f75fe0eb1f79464badd2e4fb29677e2e/0e31b/FF8zlVMqo0t5Daj-8z3Vbtw7eD6ubbro6ABm2AnfcJM.webp 75w,\n/static/f75fe0eb1f79464badd2e4fb29677e2e/4c6e4/FF8zlVMqo0t5Daj-8z3Vbtw7eD6ubbro6ABm2AnfcJM.webp 150w,\n/static/f75fe0eb1f79464badd2e4fb29677e2e/8e42d/FF8zlVMqo0t5Daj-8z3Vbtw7eD6ubbro6ABm2AnfcJM.webp 300w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 300px) 300px, 100vw"}]},"width":300,"height":450}}},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Siva Vaidhyanathan is a cultural historian and media scholar at the University of Virginia.
