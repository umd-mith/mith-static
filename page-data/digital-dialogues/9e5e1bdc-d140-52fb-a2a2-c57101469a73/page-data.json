More specifically, I identify a basic concern with the protocols governing best practices in digital text editing â€” namely, XML markup with a TEI schema. Because of such protocols and their associated transformations, online scholarly editions are vitiated by a gap between the edition as formalized in markup language and the edition as encountered by the end user. Part of my argument is on behalf of fuller transparency for online projects, which need to turn themselves inside out on demand. Scholar-users need to know more about the provenance of the data they encounter in web environments and not remain satisfied with the orchestrated performances that the interface runs.</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Andrew Stauffer Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Formalization, Transformation, and the Digital Scholarly Edition","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2009-04-14T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2009-04-14T17:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"name":"Andrew Stauffer","affiliations":[{"title":"Associate Professor","department":"English Department","institution":"University of Virginia"}],"website":null,"twitter":null,"slug":"andrew-stauffer","new_id":381,"headshot":null,"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>ANDREW STAUFFER is an associate professor of English at the University of Virginia, where he also serves as the director of the <a href=\"http://nines.org\">NINES project</a>.
