The Preserving Virtual Worlds project is actively exploring methods for preserving digital games and interactive fiction. Major activities include developing basic standards for metadata and content representation and conducting a series of archiving case studies for early video games, electronic literature and Second Life, an interactive multiplayer game. Project partners are the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (lead), the University of Maryland, Stanford University, Rochester Institute of Technology and Linden Lab. Second Life content participants include Life to the Second Power, Democracy Island and the International Spaceflight Museum. The Preserving Virtual Worlds project is funded by the Preserving Creative America initiative under the National Digital Information Infrastructure Preservation Program (NDIIPP) administered by the Library of Congress. In this MITH Research Update, we will discuss the current state of the project eighteen months into the grant cycle, and suggest directions for future research.</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Neil Fraistat, Matthew Kirschenbaum, Kari Kraus, Doug Reside Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Preserving Virtual Worlds","talk_subtitle":"A MITH Research Update","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2009-04-28T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2009-04-28T17:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"name":"Neil Fraistat","affiliations":[{"title":"Director","department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"website":null,"twitter":"fraistat","slug":"neil-fraistat","new_id":22,"headshot":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#081808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/132efadff15655edd6d1a28ea92b5a8f/0fdf4/6Y0UIK0ALAYkGIlAhI2ftXrGN8oBt86kAm-ADkYKqbE.jpg","srcSet":"/static/132efadff15655edd6d1a28ea92b5a8f/91a6d/6Y0UIK0ALAYkGIlAhI2ftXrGN8oBt86kAm-ADkYKqbE.jpg 75w,\n/static/132efadff15655edd6d1a28ea92b5a8f/96deb/6Y0UIK0ALAYkGIlAhI2ftXrGN8oBt86kAm-ADkYKqbE.jpg 150w,\n/static/132efadff15655edd6d1a28ea92b5a8f/0fdf4/6Y0UIK0ALAYkGIlAhI2ftXrGN8oBt86kAm-ADkYKqbE.jpg 300w","sizes":"(min-width: 300px) 300px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/132efadff15655edd6d1a28ea92b5a8f/18188/6Y0UIK0ALAYkGIlAhI2ftXrGN8oBt86kAm-ADkYKqbE.webp 75w,\n/static/132efadff15655edd6d1a28ea92b5a8f/c65bc/6Y0UIK0ALAYkGIlAhI2ftXrGN8oBt86kAm-ADkYKqbE.webp 150w,\n/static/132efadff15655edd6d1a28ea92b5a8f/078c3/6Y0UIK0ALAYkGIlAhI2ftXrGN8oBt86kAm-ADkYKqbE.webp 300w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 300px) 300px, 100vw"}]},"width":300,"height":300}}},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Neil Fraistat is Professor of English and Director of the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) at the University of Maryland.
