This metaphor has invariably led to debate as to who is in this “tent,” and who is not – essentially, who is a member of the digital humanities community (or who is a digital humanist), and who is not.\nCuriously, archaeology (especially anthropological archaeology) is largely absent from this discussion. Archeologists rarely publish in the same places as digital humanists. For the most part, archaeologists do not seek funding from the same agencies (and programs) that digital humanists commonly turn to. It is also rare to see archaeologists at digital humanities conferences (or unconferences). In fact, many in the archaeological community aren’t even aware that the digital humanities exist. To extend the metaphor, they are so far from the tent, they can’t even see it.\nThis state of affairs is puzzling. Archaeology clearly articulates nicely with many of the fields that identify as being part of DH. Archaeologists have also long been invested in a wide variety of innovative digital technologies and practices. Ultimately, this odd separation represents an enormous missed opportunity, as the communities clearly have a great deal to offer one another.\nIt’s within this context that this talk will explore the reasons for this separation. More importantly, however, it will propose some key points of commonality between the digital humanities and archaeology in an attempt to suggest pathways to fruitful engagement, interaction, and collaboration.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Ethan Watrall Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Archaeology and the Big Tent of the Digital Humanities","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2012-10-04T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2012-10-04T17:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Ethan Watrall","website":null,"twitter":"captain_primate","slug":"ethan-watrall","new_id":430,"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#381808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/beb9228a4cc9817737adefec15dfa42c/82bf7/watrall..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/beb9228a4cc9817737adefec15dfa42c/415ef/watrall..jpg 1086w,\n/mith-static/static/beb9228a4cc9817737adefec15dfa42c/c6eea/watrall..jpg 2171w,\n/mith-static/static/beb9228a4cc9817737adefec15dfa42c/82bf7/watrall..jpg 4342w","sizes":"(min-width: 4342px) 4342px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/beb9228a4cc9817737adefec15dfa42c/f2ec3/watrall..webp 1086w,\n/mith-static/static/beb9228a4cc9817737adefec15dfa42c/eef58/watrall..webp 2171w,\n/mith-static/static/beb9228a4cc9817737adefec15dfa42c/7fc59/watrall..webp 4342w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 4342px) 4342px, 100vw"}]},"width":4342,"height":3456}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"department":"Anthropology","institution":"Michigan State University","title":"Assistant Professor","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"ethan-watrall"}}]}}]}}],"linked_links":[{"data":{"id":196,"title":"Watch Keynote","url":"https://archive.org/download/dd_2012_10_04/dd_2012_10_04.key","type":"file_link"}}],"video_id":"172938084","video_url":"https://vimeo.com/172938084","livestream":null,"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"department":"Anthropology","institution":"Michigan State University","title":"Assistant Professor","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"ethan-watrall"}}]}},{"data":{"department":"MATRIX","institution":"Michigan State University","title":"Associate Director","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"ethan-watrall"}}]}},{"data":{"department":"Cultural Heritage Informatics Initiative","institution":"Michigan State University","title":"Director","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"ethan-watrall"}}]}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
