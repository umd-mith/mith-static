In addition, she will discuss how this originally paper-based kinetic poem came to be transformed into its current Flash-animated state, and enumerate the strengths and weaknesses of its two existent forms (its physical form on the printed page, and its digital Flash-animated form), especially as compared to its ideal form which currently exists only in concept.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Oni Buchanan Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"The Mandrake Vehicles","talk_subtitle":"Kinetic Poetry in Physical and Digital Forms","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2008-03-25T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2008-03-25T17:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Oni Buchanan","website":null,"twitter":null,"slug":"oni-buchanan","new_id":513,"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Oni Buchanan is a young American pianist who focuses her virtuosity and inventiveness on creating and bringing to life themed concerts full of originality, curiosity, vitality, and a wide range of amazing piano works.
