A growing, international body of classicists are dedicated not simply to creating digital tools but to reimagining the field against the opportunities and challenges of the digital world in which we already live. On the one hand, we are beginning to see new possibilities for research that were not feasible with the tools of print culture. At the same time, and perhaps even more importantly, we are seeing a reorganization of who can participate and what they can contribute. We can see the possibility of a truly global field emerging, with implications far beyond the traditional bounds of classical studies.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Greg Crane Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"From the First Year Through Tenure","talk_subtitle":"New Pathways for Humanities in a Digital Age ","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2009-11-11T17:30:00.000Z","end":"2009-11-11T21:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Greg  Crane","website":"https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/about/who/gregoryCrane","twitter":"GegoryR","slug":"greg-crane","new_id":434,"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/0ea9c75485147c30761d44e51cd32688/d6c95/Greg-Crane..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/0ea9c75485147c30761d44e51cd32688/c9998/Greg-Crane..jpg 100w,\n/mith-static/static/0ea9c75485147c30761d44e51cd32688/503f5/Greg-Crane..jpg 200w,\n/mith-static/static/0ea9c75485147c30761d44e51cd32688/d6c95/Greg-Crane..jpg 400w","sizes":"(min-width: 400px) 400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/0ea9c75485147c30761d44e51cd32688/90ebf/Greg-Crane..webp 100w,\n/mith-static/static/0ea9c75485147c30761d44e51cd32688/59b5d/Greg-Crane..webp 200w,\n/mith-static/static/0ea9c75485147c30761d44e51cd32688/697e6/Greg-Crane..webp 400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 400px) 400px, 100vw"}]},"width":400,"height":250}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p><strong>Greg Crane</strong> is currently a Professor of Classics, as well as Editor-in-Chief of the Perseus Project at Tufts University.
