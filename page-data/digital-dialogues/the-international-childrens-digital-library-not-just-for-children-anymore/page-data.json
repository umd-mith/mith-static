Developed by an interdisciplinary, intergenerational research team at the University of Maryland, the collection currently includes contemporary and historic children's books in 48 languages from 60 countries. The interface is available in sixteen languages. Although originally developed for children from ages 3-13, the research team has been working on extending the ICDL for use by other audiences and available on other platforms. Through partnerships with the Universities of Florida, Connecticut, and Minnesota, as well as the Boston Public Library, four special collections of historic children's materials, which may be of particular interest to humanities scholars, are now available.\nThe members of the technology team have created a new prototype that explores how the simplicity of the ICDL interface can be extended to a broader set of content for a wider audience. This new interface targets content for adults and adult users. Working with the Boston Public Library, this first effort demonstrates its application to 1,500 books from John Adams' collection in the Open Content Alliance (OCA). The Team also has built a new prototype that extends the reach of the ICDL to mobile phones. An iPhone application that offers four books in multiple languages using a special \"ClearText\" technology that makes the picture books readable even on these small screens, will be available soon. Members of the ICDL research team will describe the new special collections, demonstrate the new technologies, and discuss the project's goal of using technology to deliver the widest range of books to the widest range of audiences.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Ann Weeks, Ben Bederson Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"The International Children's Digital Library","talk_subtitle":"Not Just for Children Anymore","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2008-11-18T17:30:00.000Z","end":"2008-11-18T18:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Ann  Weeks","website":null,"twitter":null,"slug":"ann-weeks","new_id":383,"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/5ef745607886f39569ea7d4002f51259/3b5aa/aweeks..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/5ef745607886f39569ea7d4002f51259/8eeec/aweeks..jpg 61w,\n/mith-static/static/5ef745607886f39569ea7d4002f51259/4acaf/aweeks..jpg 121w,\n/mith-static/static/5ef745607886f39569ea7d4002f51259/3b5aa/aweeks..jpg 242w","sizes":"(min-width: 242px) 242px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/5ef745607886f39569ea7d4002f51259/d5ae1/aweeks..webp 61w,\n/mith-static/static/5ef745607886f39569ea7d4002f51259/e6fda/aweeks..webp 121w,\n/mith-static/static/5ef745607886f39569ea7d4002f51259/d9cbe/aweeks..webp 242w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 242px) 242px, 100vw"}]},"width":242,"height":302}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"department":"College of Information Studies","institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Professor of the Practice","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"ann-weeks"}}]}}]}},{"data":{"name":"Ben  Bederson","website":"https://cs.umd.edu/~bederson/","twitter":"bederson","slug":"ben-bederson","new_id":389,"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/a7bdd157693ea0103c91f4e8c5b04b94/079bf/bederson..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/a7bdd157693ea0103c91f4e8c5b04b94/4d18c/bederson..jpg 55w,\n/mith-static/static/a7bdd157693ea0103c91f4e8c5b04b94/28ae9/bederson..jpg 110w,\n/mith-static/static/a7bdd157693ea0103c91f4e8c5b04b94/079bf/bederson..jpg 220w","sizes":"(min-width: 220px) 220px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/a7bdd157693ea0103c91f4e8c5b04b94/07dd4/bederson..webp 55w,\n/mith-static/static/a7bdd157693ea0103c91f4e8c5b04b94/6dbad/bederson..webp 110w,\n/mith-static/static/a7bdd157693ea0103c91f4e8c5b04b94/45999/bederson..webp 220w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 220px) 220px, 100vw"}]},"width":220,"height":273}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p><strong>Benjamin B.
