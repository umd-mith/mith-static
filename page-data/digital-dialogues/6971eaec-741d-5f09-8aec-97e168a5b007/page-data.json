This talk will take Bruno Latour’s Compositionist Manifesto as well as the speaker’s personal history as a professional “online metrics” analyst as a jumping off point. We will look at the composition of autonomous agents and static texts alike, specifically the weird internet and internet art. We’ll see what these things do and discuss ways to send probes out into the world, and what can tell us that we can never gain through analysis of corpora.</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Darius Kazemi Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Strange Bedfellows","talk_subtitle":"Digital Humanities, Internet Art, and the Weird Internet","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2014-11-04T17:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"name":"Darius Kazemi","affiliations":[{"title":"Independent Artist","department":null,"institution":null}],"website":"https://davelester.org","twitter":"davelester","slug":"darius-kazemi","new_id":415,"headshot":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#b89868","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/08076114443486334196573f97f04dac/24f3d/yVx4_AcGfsksPZg4sC-j72fyzQKIkfZb5HbYT2HTAi0.png","srcSet":"/static/08076114443486334196573f97f04dac/10479/yVx4_AcGfsksPZg4sC-j72fyzQKIkfZb5HbYT2HTAi0.png 115w,\n/static/08076114443486334196573f97f04dac/b7af2/yVx4_AcGfsksPZg4sC-j72fyzQKIkfZb5HbYT2HTAi0.png 230w,\n/static/08076114443486334196573f97f04dac/24f3d/yVx4_AcGfsksPZg4sC-j72fyzQKIkfZb5HbYT2HTAi0.png 460w","sizes":"(min-width: 460px) 460px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/08076114443486334196573f97f04dac/f8466/yVx4_AcGfsksPZg4sC-j72fyzQKIkfZb5HbYT2HTAi0.webp 115w,\n/static/08076114443486334196573f97f04dac/84992/yVx4_AcGfsksPZg4sC-j72fyzQKIkfZb5HbYT2HTAi0.webp 230w,\n/static/08076114443486334196573f97f04dac/b5c5b/yVx4_AcGfsksPZg4sC-j72fyzQKIkfZb5HbYT2HTAi0.webp 460w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 460px) 460px, 100vw"}]},"width":460,"height":460}}},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Darius Kazemi makes weird internet stuff.
