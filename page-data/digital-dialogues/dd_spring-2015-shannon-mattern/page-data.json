They’ve long been shaped by their roles as substrates for and containers of mediation, and they’ve long reflected the logics, politics, and aesthetics of their prevailing communications technologies. I advocate for an “urban media archaeology,” a materialist, multisensory approach to exploring the deep material history – that is, a cultural materialist history that acknowledges the physicality, the “stuff” of history and culture – of our media cities. This talk offers a preview of <em>Deep Mapping the Media City</em>, a book forthcoming (in March 2015) from the University of Minnesota Press’s Forerunners series, in which I investigate our material urban spaces as infrastructures for mediation, and I propose that archaeological tools, like excavation and mapping, might help us to acknowledge and understand our smart, mediated cities in the longue durée.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Shannon Mattern Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Strata of Sentience","talk_subtitle":"Deep Mapping the Media City","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2015-02-24T17:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Shannon Mattern","website":"https://wordsinspace.net","twitter":"shannonmattern","slug":"shannon-mattern","new_id":527,"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#e8e8e8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/883f63c7f47bfb97899475ac1bb4e9ff/def91/shannon-mattern-new2..jpg","srcSet":"/static/883f63c7f47bfb97899475ac1bb4e9ff/df91e/shannon-mattern-new2..jpg 131w,\n/static/883f63c7f47bfb97899475ac1bb4e9ff/9a46b/shannon-mattern-new2..jpg 263w,\n/static/883f63c7f47bfb97899475ac1bb4e9ff/def91/shannon-mattern-new2..jpg 525w","sizes":"(min-width: 525px) 525px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/883f63c7f47bfb97899475ac1bb4e9ff/1b701/shannon-mattern-new2..webp 131w,\n/static/883f63c7f47bfb97899475ac1bb4e9ff/90103/shannon-mattern-new2..webp 263w,\n/static/883f63c7f47bfb97899475ac1bb4e9ff/a7b62/shannon-mattern-new2..webp 525w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 525px) 525px, 100vw"}]},"width":525,"height":350}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"department":null,"institution":"The New School","title":"Associate Professor of Media Studies","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"shannon-mattern"}}]}}]}}],"linked_links":null,"video_id":"120827621","video_url":"https://vimeo.com/120827621","livestream":null,"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"department":null,"institution":"The New School","title":"Associate Professor of Media Studies","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"shannon-mattern"}}]}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
