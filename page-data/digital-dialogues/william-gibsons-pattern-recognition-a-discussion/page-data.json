Anyone with an interest in the book is welcome to attend.\n<em>Pattern Recognition</em> has been widely received as Gibson's most significant and prescient work since he coined the term \"cyberspace\" in 1984. \"We have no future because the present is too volatile,\" observes one character. \"We have only risk management. The spinning of a given moment's scenarios. Pattern recognition.\" But how do we tell the difference between pattern and coincidence? Is pattern recognition enabling or constraining? What kind of patterns emerge in a novel about digital art, Web memes, global capital, viral marketing, a postmodern advertising agency, cool hunters, and collectors of antiquarian computing equipment in settings from London to Tokyo to Moscow to post-9/11 New York? Our discussion will be the basis for three additional Digital Dialogues, to be held at intervals throughout the semester, each of which will explore the general theme of \"pattern recognition\"–a heuristic for much of MITH's current research–in varied contexts.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Community Discussion Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"William Gibson's Pattern Recognition: A Discussion","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2006-02-07T17:30:00.000Z","end":"2006-02-07T18:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Craig  Dietrich","website":"http://craigdietrich.com ","twitter":"craigdietrich","slug":"craig-dietrich","new_id":411,"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"department":null,"institution":"University of Maryland Baltimore County","title":"Associate Professor","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"craig-dietrich"}}]}}]}}],"linked_links":null,"video_id":null,"video_url":null,"livestream":null,"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"department":null,"institution":"University of Maryland Baltimore County","title":"Associate Professor","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"craig-dietrich"}}]}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["196133661","2857345991"],"slicesMap":{}}
