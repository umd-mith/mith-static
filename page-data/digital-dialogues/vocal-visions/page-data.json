The gestural characteristics of the speakers from different regions, while unique to the speaker, are also unique to the culture of the region and help the researcher to acquire the sounds intrinsic to that dialect or accent by the formation of the lips and use of the vocal and articulatory musculature. As a crowd-sourced website, or \"wiki\", the Visual Accent Dialect Archive has the potential to attract dialect and accent donations from all over the world. Donors may speak a story, or a list of words, or a paragraph. Once the VADA website is populated, researchers can click on a specific region, country, or state and locate the specific dialect or accent. In addition to being a central resource for performers, the website provides excellent cultural information for anthropologists and linguists.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Leigh Wilson Smiley Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Vocal Visions","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2012-02-28T17:30:00.000Z","end":"2012-02-28T18:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Seminar Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Leigh  Wilson Smiley","website":null,"twitter":null,"slug":"leigh-wilson-smiley","new_id":147,"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/29a6d071fd6529a1f466f8bd4c437e4f/37bcf/leighsmiley..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/29a6d071fd6529a1f466f8bd4c437e4f/61121/leighsmiley..jpg 41w,\n/mith-static/static/29a6d071fd6529a1f466f8bd4c437e4f/27cb8/leighsmiley..jpg 82w,\n/mith-static/static/29a6d071fd6529a1f466f8bd4c437e4f/37bcf/leighsmiley..jpg 163w","sizes":"(min-width: 163px) 163px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/29a6d071fd6529a1f466f8bd4c437e4f/e7364/leighsmiley..webp 41w,\n/mith-static/static/29a6d071fd6529a1f466f8bd4c437e4f/4f783/leighsmiley..webp 82w,\n/mith-static/static/29a6d071fd6529a1f466f8bd4c437e4f/971ed/leighsmiley..webp 163w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 163px) 163px, 100vw"}]},"width":163,"height":225}}}]},"affiliations":[{"data":{"department":"School of Theatre, Dance, and Performance Studies","institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Associate Professor","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":null,"slug":"leigh-wilson-smiley"}}]}}]}}],"linked_links":[{"data":{"id":180,"title":"Watch Keynote","url":"https://archive.org/download/dd_2012_02_28/dd_2012_02_28.key","type":"file_link"}},{"data":{"id":181,"title":"View Slides","url":"https://archive.mith.umd.edu/mith-2020/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/dd_2012_02_28.pdf","type":"attachment"}},{"data":{"id":12,"title":"VADA Website","url":"http://visualaccentdialectarchive.com","type":"url"}}],"video_id":"172940859","video_url":"https://vimeo.com/172940859","livestream":null,"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":[{"data":{"term":"Informatics","type":"Discipline"}},{"data":{"term":"Performance Studies: Dance, Theatre","type":"Discipline"}}],"methods":[{"data":{"term":"cultural analytics","type":"Method"}},{"data":{"term":"digital archiving","type":"Method"}},{"data":{"term":"speech processing analysis and methods","type":"Method"}}],"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"department":"School of Theatre, Dance, and Performance Studies","institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Associate Professor","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":null,"slug":"leigh-wilson-smiley"}}]}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
