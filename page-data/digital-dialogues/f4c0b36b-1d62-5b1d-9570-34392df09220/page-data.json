In particular, I look at how historians might encounter the evidentiary record of the first important business events of the electronic era, the rise and fall of internet technology companies during the Dot Com Era. To help address the issues confronting would-be historians, I have created a dedicated digital archive to capture potentially historic business records. I will review the motivations for creating the Archive(s), outline its general goals, and review the essential challenges that have been encountered thus far.</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"David Kirsch Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"“The Business of America”","talk_subtitle":"Preservation of Born Digital Business Records from the Dot Com Era","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2006-09-19T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2006-09-19T17:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room, McKeldin Library B0135","speakers":[{"name":"David Kirsch","affiliations":[{"title":"Digital Archive of the Birth of the Dot Com Era and Assistant Professor","department":"Robert H.
