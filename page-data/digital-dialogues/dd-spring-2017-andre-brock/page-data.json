In response, many Black folk have begun describing the effects these videos and shares have upon them, a phenomenon that can be understood as <a href=\"http://www.academia.edu/1756366/Challenging_Racial_Battle_Fatigue_on_Historically_White_Campuses_A_Critical_Race_Examination_of_Race-Related_Stress_William_A._Smith_Tara_J._Yosso_and_Daniel_G._Solorzano._Book_Chapter_2006_Reprinted_2011\">racial battle fatigue</a>.\nThis presentation, in the mode of critical digital humanities, addresses how social and digital media mediates and manifests the ‘<a href=\"http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095736688\">peculiar social environment</a>’ of White racial ideology. One egregious example can be found in <a href=\"http://culturedigitally.org/2013/12/glitch-racism-networks-as-actors-within-vernacular-internet-theory/\">Lisa Nakamura’s 2013 essay</a> describing how White racial ideology configures internet beliefs and discourses to portray racist digital practice as a “glitch.”\nWhite racial ideology (“whiteness”) in online spaces is not always explicit, however. It takes many paths toward coercion and hegemony; I speculate here upon algorithmically-driven social media “feeds,” rather than individuals, enacting racist digital practice. This practice, which I argue for here as “weak tie racism,” becomes apparent in its engendering of the Black digital practice of reflexivity. This reflexivity, presented as cultural digital practice, is often expressed as spiritual, emotional, and physical engagement with online racism. Taken together, weak tie racism and Black online reflexivity can be understood as a dialectic of cultural digital practices that should be considered a norm, rather than a glitch.</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Andre Brock Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"The Price of the Ticket","talk_subtitle":"Racism, Black Digital Practice, and Racism Battle Fatigue","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2017-02-28T17:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"name":"André Brock","affiliations":[{"title":"Assistant Professor of Communication Studies","department":null,"institution":"University of Michigan "}],"website":"https://umich.academia.edu/Andr%C3%A9Brock","twitter":"DocDre","slug":"andre-brock","new_id":378,"headshot":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#d8d8d8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/7f4724e1b74393c3d391181bfe15f5c3/c8beb/Andre-Brock-photo.jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/7f4724e1b74393c3d391181bfe15f5c3/d1059/Andre-Brock-photo.jpg 120w,\n/mith-static/static/7f4724e1b74393c3d391181bfe15f5c3/06873/Andre-Brock-photo.jpg 240w,\n/mith-static/static/7f4724e1b74393c3d391181bfe15f5c3/c8beb/Andre-Brock-photo.jpg 480w","sizes":"(min-width: 480px) 480px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/7f4724e1b74393c3d391181bfe15f5c3/d3719/Andre-Brock-photo.webp 120w,\n/mith-static/static/7f4724e1b74393c3d391181bfe15f5c3/ac7f7/Andre-Brock-photo.webp 240w,\n/mith-static/static/7f4724e1b74393c3d391181bfe15f5c3/b46c9/Andre-Brock-photo.webp 480w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 480px) 480px, 100vw"}]},"width":480,"height":640}}},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>André Brock is an Assistant Professor of Communication Studies at the University of Michigan.
