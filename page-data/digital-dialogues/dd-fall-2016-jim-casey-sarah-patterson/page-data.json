Working with literature and data connected to this understudied phenomenon in Black political organizing, Patterson and Casey will discuss the ways CCP’s interdisciplinary team produces narrative-centric exhibits and interactive visualizations for multiple learning communities. This presentation will especially chart CCP’s interest in tackling key questions on its journey to creating DH content for those interested in social justice pedagogies and collaborative knowledge production.\nQuestions of focus will include: How do we better grasp women’s instrumentality through mapping technologies that magnify their activities within historical spaces connected to the movement? How do social network analyses contribute to our understanding of Black convention leadership? In what ways do concepts of power and authority impact computing and technology-selection as the project emerges within a broader landscape of Black histo-digital studies? We seek to highlight DH praxis and pedagogies to enhance what scholarly and public audiences know about the debates, people, places and texts related to the seven-decades-long campaign for Black rights.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Sara Patterson, Jim Casey Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"To Organize, Organize, ORGANIZE","talk_subtitle":"The Colored Conventions, Then and Now","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2016-11-08T17:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Sarah  Patterson","website":"http://english.udel.edu/people/Pages/bio.aspx?i=232","twitter":"Sarah_Patterson","slug":"sarah-patterson","new_id":523,"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/429a338d7672bc2912e2045cccb8729c/28cc8/Sarah_Patterson__Department_of_English__UMass_Amherst..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/429a338d7672bc2912e2045cccb8729c/5dc84/Sarah_Patterson__Department_of_English__UMass_Amherst..jpg 60w,\n/mith-static/static/429a338d7672bc2912e2045cccb8729c/cf347/Sarah_Patterson__Department_of_English__UMass_Amherst..jpg 120w,\n/mith-static/static/429a338d7672bc2912e2045cccb8729c/28cc8/Sarah_Patterson__Department_of_English__UMass_Amherst..jpg 239w","sizes":"(min-width: 239px) 239px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/429a338d7672bc2912e2045cccb8729c/bc9f1/Sarah_Patterson__Department_of_English__UMass_Amherst..webp 60w,\n/mith-static/static/429a338d7672bc2912e2045cccb8729c/c4ad1/Sarah_Patterson__Department_of_English__UMass_Amherst..webp 120w,\n/mith-static/static/429a338d7672bc2912e2045cccb8729c/e9b20/Sarah_Patterson__Department_of_English__UMass_Amherst..webp 239w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 239px) 239px, 100vw"}]},"width":239,"height":270}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"department":null,"institution":"Arizona State University","title":"Assistant Professor of Film and Media Studies","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"sarah-patterson"}}]}}]}},{"data":{"name":"Jim  Casey","website":"http://english.udel.edu/people/Pages/bio.aspx?i=68","twitter":"jimccasey1","slug":"jim-casey","new_id":456,"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#b88858","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/985a0e0e791ac179cadeef25263415b1/b86de/Jim_Casey_--_Program_in_Humanistic_Studies..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/985a0e0e791ac179cadeef25263415b1/fd962/Jim_Casey_--_Program_in_Humanistic_Studies..jpg 203w,\n/mith-static/static/985a0e0e791ac179cadeef25263415b1/719fa/Jim_Casey_--_Program_in_Humanistic_Studies..jpg 407w,\n/mith-static/static/985a0e0e791ac179cadeef25263415b1/b86de/Jim_Casey_--_Program_in_Humanistic_Studies..jpg 813w","sizes":"(min-width: 813px) 813px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/985a0e0e791ac179cadeef25263415b1/d02a5/Jim_Casey_--_Program_in_Humanistic_Studies..webp 203w,\n/mith-static/static/985a0e0e791ac179cadeef25263415b1/8c92d/Jim_Casey_--_Program_in_Humanistic_Studies..webp 407w,\n/mith-static/static/985a0e0e791ac179cadeef25263415b1/a7ac3/Jim_Casey_--_Program_in_Humanistic_Studies..webp 813w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 813px) 813px, 100vw"}]},"width":813,"height":650}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"department":null,"institution":"University of Delaware","title":"PhD Candidate, Department of English","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"jim-casey"}}]}}]}}],"linked_links":[{"data":{"id":229,"title":"Storify Link","url":"https://storify.com/digdialog/jim-casey-sarah-patterson-digital-dialogue-novembe","type":"file_link"}},{"data":{"id":230,"title":"Jim Casey and Sarah Patterson Presentation Slides","url":"https://archive.mith.umd.edu/mith-2020/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Casey-Patterson-Presentation-Slides.pdf","type":"attachment"}}],"video_id":"190779624","video_url":"https://vimeo.com/190779624","livestream":null,"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":[{"data":{"term":"African and African American Studies","type":"Discipline"}}],"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"department":null,"institution":"Arizona State University","title":"Assistant Professor of Film and Media Studies","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"sarah-patterson"}}]}},{"data":{"department":null,"institution":"University of Delaware","title":"PhD Candidate, Department of English","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"jim-casey"}}]}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["196133661","2857345991"],"slicesMap":{}}
