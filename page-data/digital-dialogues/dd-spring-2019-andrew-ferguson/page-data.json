But while the word “glitch” is often still used to connote catastrophic failure, videogamers have come to view glitches opportunistically, as chances to intervene in game texts in ways unforeseen (and often unforeseeable) by their developers. The results range from the ability to walk through walls, to new strategies for survival in unfavorable conditions, all the way to the discovery of entirely new navigable spaces outside the game’s imposed boundaries.\nMy presentation draws on a variety of game glitches and the alternate modes of textual navigation they enable to demonstrate how the glitch forces us to rethink even such basic concepts as plot, character, temporality, and point of view, ultimately showing how the resulting “narrative of malfunction” blends and reshapes digital studies, narratology, and queer/disability theory to establish brokenness, error, and failure as baseline states within which narrative “function” is at best temporary and often actively to be avoided. All texts are thus potentially glitched, and much can be learned and accomplished within them by reading for the glitches.</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Andrew Ferguson Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Videogames, Glitches, and the Narrative of Malfunction","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2019-03-26T16:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"name":"Andrew Ferguson","affiliations":[{"title":"Visiting Assistant Professor","department":"English","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"website":null,"twitter":"epiktistes","slug":"andrew-ferguson","new_id":379,"headshot":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/1e8f8d4c2350e0effec2fc3013a3dda3/b48c1/andrew-ferguson.png","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/1e8f8d4c2350e0effec2fc3013a3dda3/0d048/andrew-ferguson.png 52w,\n/mith-static/static/1e8f8d4c2350e0effec2fc3013a3dda3/78334/andrew-ferguson.png 103w,\n/mith-static/static/1e8f8d4c2350e0effec2fc3013a3dda3/b48c1/andrew-ferguson.png 206w","sizes":"(min-width: 206px) 206px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/1e8f8d4c2350e0effec2fc3013a3dda3/0c9c2/andrew-ferguson.webp 52w,\n/mith-static/static/1e8f8d4c2350e0effec2fc3013a3dda3/4251f/andrew-ferguson.webp 103w,\n/mith-static/static/1e8f8d4c2350e0effec2fc3013a3dda3/6a106/andrew-ferguson.webp 206w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 206px) 206px, 100vw"}]},"width":206,"height":194}}},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Andrew Ferguson is a visiting assistant professor of digital studies in the Department of English at UMD.
