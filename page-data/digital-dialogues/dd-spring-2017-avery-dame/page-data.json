However, what happens to born-digital materials which can technically be accessed—but whose content and format may not be accessible in the contemporary media environment? In this presentation, I’ll talk more about my process working with materials from the Usenet Historical Collection to build the <a href=\"https://archive.mith.umd.edu/mith-2020/gets-us-talking-cant-bad-building-transgender-usenet-archive/index.html\">Transgender Usenet Archive</a> and conduct my own research. I’ll discuss the technical and ethical challenges I faced in building the archive, as well as how these challenges informed my own research into early use of the term “cisgender” in transgender discourse.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Avery Dame Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Spotlighting Hidden Histories","talk_subtitle":"Archiving Transgender Usenet, 1994-2013","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2017-03-28T16:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Avery  Dame","website":"https://averydame.net","twitter":"averydame","slug":"avery-dame","new_id":161,"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#b8b8b8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/8855590ce9bb332b53487d20651e1675/89ca3/avery-dame..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/8855590ce9bb332b53487d20651e1675/5ad19/avery-dame..jpg 250w,\n/mith-static/static/8855590ce9bb332b53487d20651e1675/168ad/avery-dame..jpg 500w,\n/mith-static/static/8855590ce9bb332b53487d20651e1675/89ca3/avery-dame..jpg 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/8855590ce9bb332b53487d20651e1675/7898e/avery-dame..webp 250w,\n/mith-static/static/8855590ce9bb332b53487d20651e1675/1dffe/avery-dame..webp 500w,\n/mith-static/static/8855590ce9bb332b53487d20651e1675/49d17/avery-dame..webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":933.9999999999999}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"department":null,"institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Ph.D. Candidate in Women's Studies","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"avery-dame"}}]}}]}}],"linked_links":[{"data":{"id":250,"title":"Presentation Slides","url":"https://archive.mith.umd.edu/mith-2020/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Avery-Dame-Presentation-Slides.pdf","type":"attachment"}},{"data":{"id":249,"title":"Storify Link","url":"https://storify.com/digdialog/avery-dame-digital-dialogue-march-28-2017#publicize","type":"file_link"}}],"video_id":"211693455","video_url":"https://vimeo.com/211693455","livestream":null,"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"department":null,"institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Ph.D. Candidate in Women's Studies","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"avery-dame"}}]}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["196133661","2857345991"],"slicesMap":{}}
