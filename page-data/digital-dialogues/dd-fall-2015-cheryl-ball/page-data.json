Vega will be a free, editorial-management platform that supports peer review, copy-editing, and publication of multimedia-rich and data-driven scholarship and creative works in all areas of research. With the support of an Andrew W. Mellon Foundation grant, Vega is being designed with a unique editorial workflow that recognizes and values the importance of screen-based multimedia research, including digital humanities projects and electronic literature. What many journals and presses that publish this kind of work lack is an editorial management system that will move a piece of scholarly multimedia through the submission, review, and production processes as a single, scholarly entity. I will discuss the platform, its authorial and editorial features, and welcome questions and comments from an audience of potential users of Vega, which is only part-way through its first year of a three-year development cycle.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Cheryl Ball Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"The Archipelago of Multimedia Publishing","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2015-10-13T16:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Cheryl  Ball","website":"http://ceball.com","twitter":"s2ceball","slug":"cheryl-ball","new_id":401,"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#b8b8b8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/444fc56c2c364112de1185426ccaba28/9fd8f/Cheryl_Ball..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/444fc56c2c364112de1185426ccaba28/790fb/Cheryl_Ball..jpg 70w,\n/mith-static/static/444fc56c2c364112de1185426ccaba28/00626/Cheryl_Ball..jpg 140w,\n/mith-static/static/444fc56c2c364112de1185426ccaba28/9fd8f/Cheryl_Ball..jpg 280w","sizes":"(min-width: 280px) 280px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/444fc56c2c364112de1185426ccaba28/7f19d/Cheryl_Ball..webp 70w,\n/mith-static/static/444fc56c2c364112de1185426ccaba28/35ad7/Cheryl_Ball..webp 140w,\n/mith-static/static/444fc56c2c364112de1185426ccaba28/4c653/Cheryl_Ball..webp 280w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 280px) 280px, 100vw"}]},"width":280,"height":299}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"department":null,"institution":"West Virginia University","title":"Associate Professor of Digital Publishing","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"cheryl-ball"}}]}}]}}],"linked_links":[{"data":{"id":213,"title":"DD Presentation PDF","url":"https://archive.mith.umd.edu/mith-2020/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/CherylBall-DD-Pres-20151013-red.pdf","type":"attachment"}},{"data":{"id":214,"title":"View Storify","url":"https://storify.com/digdialog/cheryl-ball-digital-dialogue-at-mith-october-13-20","type":"file_link"}}],"video_id":"142652940","video_url":"https://vimeo.com/142652940","livestream":null,"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"department":null,"institution":"West Virginia University","title":"Associate Professor of Digital Publishing","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"cheryl-ball"}}]}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
