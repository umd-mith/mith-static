This one-year project has also produced an interactive interface and toolset for the detailed study of the quartos, with full-functionality applied to all thirty-two copies of one play, Hamlet, held at participating institutions.\nContributing content to this multi-institutional project are the Bodleian Library of the University of Oxford, the British Library, the University of Edinburgh Library, the Folger Shakespeare Library, the Huntington Library, and the National Library of Scotland. Textual encoding is provided by staff of the Oxford Digital Library of the University of Oxford. Programming and prototype design is undertaken by staff of the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities of the University of Maryland. Now, three months from the conclusion of the grant, the production team will demonstrate the current state of the interface and seek advice and feedback to guide the completion of their work.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Grant Dickie, Doug Reside Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"The Shakespeare Quartos Archive","talk_subtitle":"A MITH Research Update","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2009-03-31T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2009-03-31T17:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Grant Dickie","website":"http://www.grantdickie.com","twitter":"jgrantd","slug":"grant-dickie","new_id":48,"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/f8a388ef935f7e0fc35639628771741c/ac2d9/grant-dickie..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/f8a388ef935f7e0fc35639628771741c/9c0fb/grant-dickie..jpg 33w,\n/mith-static/static/f8a388ef935f7e0fc35639628771741c/a382f/grant-dickie..jpg 65w,\n/mith-static/static/f8a388ef935f7e0fc35639628771741c/ac2d9/grant-dickie..jpg 130w","sizes":"(min-width: 130px) 130px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/f8a388ef935f7e0fc35639628771741c/0cc22/grant-dickie..webp 33w,\n/mith-static/static/f8a388ef935f7e0fc35639628771741c/0c531/grant-dickie..webp 65w,\n/mith-static/static/f8a388ef935f7e0fc35639628771741c/a819e/grant-dickie..webp 130w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 130px) 130px, 100vw"}]},"width":130,"height":130}}}]},"affiliations":[{"data":{"department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Web Programmer","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":null,"slug":"grant-dickie"}}]}}]}},{"data":{"name":"Doug Reside","website":"http://nypl.orgstaff-profiles/doug-reside","twitter":null,"slug":"douglas-reside","new_id":29,"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/f84486fb33fd5787f4f4e6da4edf3ce5/3c367/Doug-Reside..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/f84486fb33fd5787f4f4e6da4edf3ce5/19e71/Doug-Reside..jpg 128w,\n/mith-static/static/f84486fb33fd5787f4f4e6da4edf3ce5/68974/Doug-Reside..jpg 256w,\n/mith-static/static/f84486fb33fd5787f4f4e6da4edf3ce5/3c367/Doug-Reside..jpg 512w","sizes":"(min-width: 512px) 512px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/f84486fb33fd5787f4f4e6da4edf3ce5/6766a/Doug-Reside..webp 128w,\n/mith-static/static/f84486fb33fd5787f4f4e6da4edf3ce5/22bfc/Doug-Reside..webp 256w,\n/mith-static/static/f84486fb33fd5787f4f4e6da4edf3ce5/d689f/Doug-Reside..webp 512w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 512px) 512px, 100vw"}]},"width":512,"height":512}}},{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/6cd600f0dc74ff762ed72a74d036d209/85f90/staff_dreside..png","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/6cd600f0dc74ff762ed72a74d036d209/59c6d/staff_dreside..png 29w,\n/mith-static/static/6cd600f0dc74ff762ed72a74d036d209/e3e5e/staff_dreside..png 58w,\n/mith-static/static/6cd600f0dc74ff762ed72a74d036d209/85f90/staff_dreside..png 115w","sizes":"(min-width: 115px) 115px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/6cd600f0dc74ff762ed72a74d036d209/bc2ec/staff_dreside..webp 29w,\n/mith-static/static/6cd600f0dc74ff762ed72a74d036d209/6262e/staff_dreside..webp 58w,\n/mith-static/static/6cd600f0dc74ff762ed72a74d036d209/1f876/staff_dreside..webp 115w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 115px) 115px, 100vw"}]},"width":115,"height":150}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p><strong>Doug Reside</strong> is Assistant Director of the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH).
