How do we as scholars, educators, librarians and archivists use specific cases and experiences to teach habits of critical thought and practice about the intersections between race and technology? This talk is at once a theoretical and practical reflection on an Africana/Black Studies-centered approach to the digital humanities in and outside the classroom. It, then, is a forum for considering the black digital humanities as the use of digital tools and platforms to teach and produce scholarship about the complex histories, societies, and cultures of people of African descent in the United States, Africa and the larger Diaspora. However, I hope to also think about the black digital humanities as concerned with how theories of race and blackness come to bear on and transform technological activity and processes, affording us opportunities to ask new and different questions about humanity.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Kim Gallon Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Black Digital Humanities Pedagogy and Praxis","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2016-02-23T17:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Kim Gallon","website":"http://blackpressresearchcollective.org","twitter":"BlackDigitalHum","slug":"kim-gallon","new_id":474,"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#584868","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/817fc97f814eee7dc97da65b6dd22739/23109/Gallon._Kim..jpg","srcSet":"/static/817fc97f814eee7dc97da65b6dd22739/8f545/Gallon._Kim..jpg 138w,\n/static/817fc97f814eee7dc97da65b6dd22739/cd5c2/Gallon._Kim..jpg 275w,\n/static/817fc97f814eee7dc97da65b6dd22739/23109/Gallon._Kim..jpg 550w","sizes":"(min-width: 550px) 550px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/817fc97f814eee7dc97da65b6dd22739/ca731/Gallon._Kim..webp 138w,\n/static/817fc97f814eee7dc97da65b6dd22739/881c1/Gallon._Kim..webp 275w,\n/static/817fc97f814eee7dc97da65b6dd22739/6bae4/Gallon._Kim..webp 550w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 550px) 550px, 100vw"}]},"width":550,"height":449.99999999999994}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Dr. Kim Gallon is an assistant professor of history at Purdue University.
