Rather than treat the body as primarily marking identity—gendered, racial, national—or invoke it to make claims about early cinema's sensational attractions in relation to modernity (two common approaches to the subject), I begin by focusing on films that reveal striking anxieties and preoccupations about persons on public display, both exceptional figures, such as 1896 presidential candidate William McKinley, as well as ordinary people self-consciously caught by the movie camera in their daily routines. The book closes with a meditation on early cinema and death (when the body stops moving), with implications for new media and technology studies more generally.</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Jonathan Auerbach Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Early Cinema as New Media","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2008-04-22T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2008-04-22T17:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"name":"Jonathan Auerbach","affiliations":[{"title":"Professor of English","department":null,"institution":"University of Maryland"}],"website":"http://english.umd.edu/profiles/jauerbach","twitter":null,"slug":"jonathan-auerbach","new_id":462,"headshot":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#684828","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/43d7b37332d55e214063a5f25bbf51dc/9d298/Q4tsXRKPccyuJx2GNv7nsjHMLYxsFrvYeKpUg3zXDLE.jpg","srcSet":"/static/43d7b37332d55e214063a5f25bbf51dc/67094/Q4tsXRKPccyuJx2GNv7nsjHMLYxsFrvYeKpUg3zXDLE.jpg 350w,\n/static/43d7b37332d55e214063a5f25bbf51dc/10a6f/Q4tsXRKPccyuJx2GNv7nsjHMLYxsFrvYeKpUg3zXDLE.jpg 700w,\n/static/43d7b37332d55e214063a5f25bbf51dc/9d298/Q4tsXRKPccyuJx2GNv7nsjHMLYxsFrvYeKpUg3zXDLE.jpg 1400w","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/43d7b37332d55e214063a5f25bbf51dc/a9c60/Q4tsXRKPccyuJx2GNv7nsjHMLYxsFrvYeKpUg3zXDLE.webp 350w,\n/static/43d7b37332d55e214063a5f25bbf51dc/e1299/Q4tsXRKPccyuJx2GNv7nsjHMLYxsFrvYeKpUg3zXDLE.webp 700w,\n/static/43d7b37332d55e214063a5f25bbf51dc/64ed2/Q4tsXRKPccyuJx2GNv7nsjHMLYxsFrvYeKpUg3zXDLE.webp 1400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1400px) 1400px, 100vw"}]},"width":1400,"height":1050}}},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Jonathan Auerbach is Professor of English at the University of Maryland.
