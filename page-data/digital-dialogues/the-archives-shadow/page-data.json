Cazabon will discuss her project <em>Discard</em>, which consists of several discrete series of large-scale photographic prints featuring movie films discarded by public institutions (libraries, schools, archives). Harking back to the 19th century practice of postmortem photography, each print in this body of work serves as a memento mori to the recently obsolete medium of film. In its totality, <em>Discard</em> is a shadow archive, reflecting that which has been omitted from institutional archives and reflecting upon a process by which values are reversed: whereby something once valued becomes worthless and looses its viability as a cultural artifact. The project also underlines our current reliance on potentially unstable digital technologies to preserve the things we deem to be worth saving and asks what is lost when we don’t save such physical artifacts (like film) but only transfer its image to digital media. Cazabon will also discuss the notion of the archive as it plays out in her other projects.</p>\n<p><em>We regret that the audio is not available for Lynn Cazabon's digital dialogue. However, video and slides are available for viewing.</em></p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Lynn Cazabon Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"The Archive’s Shadow","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2012-03-06T17:30:00.000Z","end":"2012-03-06T18:45:00.000Z","location":"6137 McKeldin Library, Special Events","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Lynn  Cazabon","website":null,"twitter":null,"slug":"lynn-cazabon","new_id":489,"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#282828","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/01703d4c861048f9c759c187423ffe12/1bc98/lynn-cazabon..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/01703d4c861048f9c759c187423ffe12/16ae9/lynn-cazabon..jpg 50w,\n/mith-static/static/01703d4c861048f9c759c187423ffe12/f1a82/lynn-cazabon..jpg 100w,\n/mith-static/static/01703d4c861048f9c759c187423ffe12/1bc98/lynn-cazabon..jpg 200w","sizes":"(min-width: 200px) 200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/01703d4c861048f9c759c187423ffe12/1ce18/lynn-cazabon..webp 50w,\n/mith-static/static/01703d4c861048f9c759c187423ffe12/039bf/lynn-cazabon..webp 100w,\n/mith-static/static/01703d4c861048f9c759c187423ffe12/db253/lynn-cazabon..webp 200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 200px) 200px, 100vw"}]},"width":200,"height":210}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"department":"Department of Art","institution":"University of Maryland Baltimore County","title":"Associate Professor","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"lynn-cazabon"}}]}}]}}],"linked_links":[{"data":{"id":186,"title":"Watch Keynote","url":"https://archive.org/download/dd_2012_03_06/dd_2012_03_06.key","type":"file_link"}},{"data":{"id":187,"title":"View Slides","url":"https://archive.org/download/dd_2012_03_06/dd_2012_03_06.pdf","type":"file_link"}}],"video_id":"174696775","video_url":"https://vimeo.com/174696775","livestream":null,"sponsors":[{"data":{"name":"Design, Cultures and Creativity (DCC)","website":"dcc.umd.edu","type":"Internal","slug":"dcc"}},{"data":{"name":"University of Maryland Libraries","website":"lib.umd.edu","type":"Internal","slug":"umdlib"}}],"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"department":"Department of Art","institution":"University of Maryland Baltimore County","title":"Associate Professor","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"lynn-cazabon"}}]}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
