Unfortunately, as paper is a static media, this web often gets trapped in the physical world.\nTo address these limitations, we propose PapierCraft, a gesture-based interface that allows users to manipulate digital documents directly using their printouts as proxies. Using a digital pen, users can annotate a printout or draw command gestures to indicate operations such as copying a document area, pasting an area previously copied, or creating a link. Upon pen synchronization, our infrastructure executes these commands and presents the result in a customized viewer. In this talk I will describe the design and implementation of the PapierCraft command system, and report on early user feedback.</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Chunyuan Liao Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"PapierCraft","talk_subtitle":"A Command System for Interactive Paper","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2005-10-18T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2005-10-18T17:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"name":"Chunyuan Liao","affiliations":[{"title":"Doctoral candidate","department":"Computer Science and Human-Computer Interaction Lab","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"website":null,"twitter":null,"slug":"chunyuan-liao","new_id":409,"headshot":null}],"links":[],"video_id":null,"video_url":null,"livestream":null,"sponsors":[],"partners":[],"disciplines":[],"methods":[]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
