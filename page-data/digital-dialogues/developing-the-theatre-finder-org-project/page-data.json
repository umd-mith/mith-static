Collaboratively edited and peer reviewed, it has been designed for both tourist and scholarly audiences. The project combines 25 years of research by two-time MITH fellow, Prof. Franklin J. Hildy of the School of Theatre, Dance, and Performance Studies, with the technical and design expertise of the MITH staff. Theatre Finder is intended to serve as the test platform for CAMP, a Collaborative, Ajax-Based, Modeling Platform, developed separately at MITH with funding from an NEH Level II Digital Humanities Startup Grant. This talk will examine the relationship between content and collaboration, both in terms of the development of content with international scholars and in terms of the relationship between content development and technology support</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Franklin J.
