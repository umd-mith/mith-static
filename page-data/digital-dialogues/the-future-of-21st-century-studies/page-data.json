The study of issues of pressing concern in the 21st century? The reconceptualization of historical studies in light of these concerns? The deployment of 21st century modes of research, analysis, and presentation? Richard Grusin, the new director of the Center for 21st Century Studies (C21) at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, will argue that C21 is in a unique position to define the future of 21st century studies. As the only center of its kind, C21 should take as its mission the development of 21st century studies as an interdisciplinary field. Doing so will allow C21 to set the terms of the debate about the future of 21st century studies for the decades ahead as well as to open the door for collaborations with other individuals and institutions interested in defining the future of 21st century studies.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Richard Grusin Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"The Future of 21st Century Studies","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2011-04-08T15:00:00.000Z","end":"2011-04-08T16:15:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Richard  Grusin","website":null,"twitter":null,"slug":"richard-grusin","new_id":562,"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Richard Grusin is Professor of English and Director of the Center for 21st Century Studies at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.
