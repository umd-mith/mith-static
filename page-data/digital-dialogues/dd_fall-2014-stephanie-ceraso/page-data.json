Drawing from the listening and composing practices of deaf percussionist Evelyn Glennie, acoustic designers, and automotive acoustic engineers, Ceraso proposes an expansive, explicitly embodied listening pedagogy that is based on the concept of <em>multimodal listening</em>—attending to the sensory, material, and contextual aspects that comprise and shape a sonic event. Unlike ear-centric listening practices in which listeners’ main goal is to hear and interpret audible sound (often language), multimodal listening moves beyond the exclusively audible by emphasizing the ecological relationship between sound, bodies, and environments. In this talk, Ceraso will demonstrate how multimodal listening practices enable students to become more thoughtful, savvy consumers <em>and</em> producers of sound in digital composing environments and in their everyday lives.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Stephanie Ceraso Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Listening Bodies, Digital Production, and the Pursuit of Invigorated Sonic Experiences","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2014-10-07T16:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Stephanie  Ceraso","website":"https://stephceraso.com","twitter":"stephceraso","slug":"stephanie-ceraso","new_id":531,"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/ba41d3d75b84661b79e8c8a09062ff99/97a19/Stephanie-Ceraso..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/ba41d3d75b84661b79e8c8a09062ff99/73bb6/Stephanie-Ceraso..jpg 120w,\n/mith-static/static/ba41d3d75b84661b79e8c8a09062ff99/f9edd/Stephanie-Ceraso..jpg 240w,\n/mith-static/static/ba41d3d75b84661b79e8c8a09062ff99/97a19/Stephanie-Ceraso..jpg 480w","sizes":"(min-width: 480px) 480px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/ba41d3d75b84661b79e8c8a09062ff99/507b0/Stephanie-Ceraso..webp 120w,\n/mith-static/static/ba41d3d75b84661b79e8c8a09062ff99/8d565/Stephanie-Ceraso..webp 240w,\n/mith-static/static/ba41d3d75b84661b79e8c8a09062ff99/21b1a/Stephanie-Ceraso..webp 480w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 480px) 480px, 100vw"}]},"width":480,"height":480}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"department":"Department of English","institution":"University of Maryland Baltimore County","title":"Assistant Professor","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"stephanie-ceraso"}}]}}]}}],"linked_links":[{"data":{"id":209,"title":"Sound & Listening Resources Handout","url":"http://archive.mith.umd.edu/mith-2020/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/DD_20141007_Ceraso-Handout.pdf","type":"attachment"}}],"video_id":"111130136","video_url":"https://vimeo.com/111130136","livestream":null,"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"department":"Department of English","institution":"University of Maryland Baltimore County","title":"Assistant Professor","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"stephanie-ceraso"}}]}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
