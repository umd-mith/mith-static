Recent work explores novel and engaging ways to visualize and explore cultural heritage data collections and tell little stories with big data. See demos of applications built on Microsoft PixelSense and Surfaces that demonstrate the architecture of intimacy and public interactives. These range from digital memorials to multitouch interaction to explore large-format artworks in their rich context of related artworks, annotations, and guided tours. We will also explore the technological and social challenges of creating interactive exhibits around the AIDS Memorial Quilt, the largest community-created piece of folk art in the world. These applications are a beachhead on the untouched shores of big humanities research. They are what we can expect today and are also first steps towards what might define an ideal user interface.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Donald Brinkman Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Big Heritage, Big Quilts, and Big Canvases","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2012-09-10T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2012-09-10T17:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Donald  Brinkman","website":null,"twitter":"Brinkmanship","slug":"donald-brinkman","new_id":421,"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#e8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/11c59d9b6c705079f9c3247234c0c945/f3dc5/MG_8940..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/11c59d9b6c705079f9c3247234c0c945/f6fcd/MG_8940..jpg 320w,\n/mith-static/static/11c59d9b6c705079f9c3247234c0c945/e70fc/MG_8940..jpg 640w,\n/mith-static/static/11c59d9b6c705079f9c3247234c0c945/f3dc5/MG_8940..jpg 1280w","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/11c59d9b6c705079f9c3247234c0c945/dde70/MG_8940..webp 320w,\n/mith-static/static/11c59d9b6c705079f9c3247234c0c945/62859/MG_8940..webp 640w,\n/mith-static/static/11c59d9b6c705079f9c3247234c0c945/f121e/MG_8940..webp 1280w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"}]},"width":1280,"height":853}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p><strong>Donald Brinkman</strong> manages external programs in digital humanities, digital heritage and games for learning at Microsoft Research.
