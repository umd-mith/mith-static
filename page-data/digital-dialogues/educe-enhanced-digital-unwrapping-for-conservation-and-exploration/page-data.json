The EDUCE project is developing a non-destructive volumetric scanning framework to enable access to such objects without the need to physically open them. This work is based on earlier achievements in digital restoration that have recently been applied to the Venetus A in order to digitally flatten its pages. In this presentation I will discuss the overarching theme of digital restoration and will present current progress on the EDUCE project and results from work on the Venetus A.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Brent Seales Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"EDUCE: Enhanced Digital Unwrapping for Conservation and Exploration","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2008-10-07T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2008-10-07T17:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Brent  Seales","website":"http://vis.uky.edu/about/people/faculty/brent-seales","twitter":null,"slug":"brent-seales","new_id":397,"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#282848","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/b8fa301b450ec4cbda205d999ae8bfac/a96ac/Brent-Seales..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/b8fa301b450ec4cbda205d999ae8bfac/6766b/Brent-Seales..jpg 99w,\n/mith-static/static/b8fa301b450ec4cbda205d999ae8bfac/f579a/Brent-Seales..jpg 199w,\n/mith-static/static/b8fa301b450ec4cbda205d999ae8bfac/a96ac/Brent-Seales..jpg 397w","sizes":"(min-width: 397px) 397px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/b8fa301b450ec4cbda205d999ae8bfac/07a52/Brent-Seales..webp 99w,\n/mith-static/static/b8fa301b450ec4cbda205d999ae8bfac/29303/Brent-Seales..webp 199w,\n/mith-static/static/b8fa301b450ec4cbda205d999ae8bfac/fffda/Brent-Seales..webp 397w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 397px) 397px, 100vw"}]},"width":397,"height":264}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Dr. Seales' research focuses on digital imaging in two very different directions: medical imaging and cultural heritage.
