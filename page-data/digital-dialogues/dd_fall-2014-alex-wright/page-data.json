He dubbed the whole thing the Mundaneum, describing it as a \"r√©seau mondial\" -- a worldwide web. Why should anyone still pay attention to the failed schemes of a long-dead Belgian bibliographer? Otlet's work matters today not just as a kind of historical curio, but because he envisioned a radically different kind of network: one driven not by corporate profit and personal vanity, but by a utopian vision of intellectual progress, social egalitarianism, and even spiritual liberation. This presentation will delve deep into Otlet's alternative vision of a global network, in search of useful lessons that could reshape our understanding of what the Web could yet become.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Alex Wright Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"The Platonic Network","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2014-11-11T17:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Alex Wright","website":"http://alexwright.org","twitter":"alexgrantwright","slug":"alex-wright","new_id":373,"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#787878","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/b37177aa16cabe1a98d1f78b6860fc40/d085b/Alex-Wright..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/b37177aa16cabe1a98d1f78b6860fc40/3339a/Alex-Wright..jpg 112w,\n/mith-static/static/b37177aa16cabe1a98d1f78b6860fc40/22333/Alex-Wright..jpg 223w,\n/mith-static/static/b37177aa16cabe1a98d1f78b6860fc40/d085b/Alex-Wright..jpg 446w","sizes":"(min-width: 446px) 446px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/b37177aa16cabe1a98d1f78b6860fc40/537ff/Alex-Wright..webp 112w,\n/mith-static/static/b37177aa16cabe1a98d1f78b6860fc40/22793/Alex-Wright..webp 223w,\n/mith-static/static/b37177aa16cabe1a98d1f78b6860fc40/9f255/Alex-Wright..webp 446w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 446px) 446px, 100vw"}]},"width":446,"height":372}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"department":null,"institution":"Etsy","title":"Director of Research","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"alex-wright"}}]}}]}}],"linked_links":null,"video_id":"113520682","video_url":"https://vimeo.com/113520682","livestream":null,"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"department":null,"institution":"Etsy","title":"Director of Research","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"alex-wright"}}]}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
