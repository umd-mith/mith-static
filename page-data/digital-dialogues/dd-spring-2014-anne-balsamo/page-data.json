The Quilt literally stitches together a million memories, a million stories, a million lessons about the relationship between individual lives, public culture, and political activism. In its textile form, it is an unwieldy archive. If laid out in its entirety the Quilt would cover more than 1.3 million square feet. It weighs more than 34 tons.\nThis presentation discusses the creation of an interactive memorial that was designed to augment the viewing of the textile Quilt. I will demonstrate three digital experiences: 1) an open-source mobile web application called AIDS QUILT TOUCH; 2) a tangible tabletop interactive that enables viewers to SEARCH the database of Quilt images to find a specific image and to BROWSE the archive of Quilt panel images; and 3) a community sourcing application that engages people in analyzing and archiving information about the Quilt.\nThis effort is framed by my recent transmedia book project called <em>Designing Culture: The Technological Imagination At Work</em>. In creating the Quilt Digital Experiences I was interested in exploring the cultural work of public interactives, to examine how they are implicated in practices of cultural reproduction—remembering, witnessing, archiving, and educating.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Anne Balsamo Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Heavy Data, Cultural Memories","talk_subtitle":"Lessons from the AIDS Memorial Quilt Digital Experience Project","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2014-02-18T17:30:00.000Z","end":"2014-02-18T18:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Anne Balsamo","website":null,"twitter":"annebalsamo","slug":"anne-balsamo","new_id":385,"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#484838","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/009f8abb153f525cc919eff32421a28e/0fdf4/balsamo..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/009f8abb153f525cc919eff32421a28e/91a6d/balsamo..jpg 75w,\n/mith-static/static/009f8abb153f525cc919eff32421a28e/96deb/balsamo..jpg 150w,\n/mith-static/static/009f8abb153f525cc919eff32421a28e/0fdf4/balsamo..jpg 300w","sizes":"(min-width: 300px) 300px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/009f8abb153f525cc919eff32421a28e/18188/balsamo..webp 75w,\n/mith-static/static/009f8abb153f525cc919eff32421a28e/c65bc/balsamo..webp 150w,\n/mith-static/static/009f8abb153f525cc919eff32421a28e/078c3/balsamo..webp 300w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 300px) 300px, 100vw"}]},"width":300,"height":300}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"department":null,"institution":"The New School for Public Engagement","title":"Dean and Professor of Media Studies","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"anne-balsamo"}}]}}]}}],"linked_links":null,"video_id":"87201075","video_url":"https://vimeo.com/87201075","livestream":null,"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"department":null,"institution":"The New School for Public Engagement","title":"Dean and Professor of Media Studies","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"anne-balsamo"}}]}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
