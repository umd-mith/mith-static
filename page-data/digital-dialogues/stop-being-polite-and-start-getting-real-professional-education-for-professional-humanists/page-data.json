The irony is that explicit training in the professional tools employed by professors, would actually make PhDs who end up off the tenure track, more widely employable. This presentation is intended to open up a discussion to identify professional tools that will make PhDs better professors, better alt-ac employees, and create better paths to non-academic careers. All we have to do is shake the fantasy that scholarship alone will save us, that everything practical can be absorbed through osmosis, that even admitting contingency is tantamount to failure. It's time to get real about who we are and what we do.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Tim Carmody Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Stop Being Polite and Start Getting Real","talk_subtitle":"Professional Education for Professional Humanists","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2011-03-01T17:30:00.000Z","end":"2011-03-01T18:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Tim  Carmody","website":null,"twitter":null,"slug":"tim-carmody","new_id":542,"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/6443e4e5c24d116d2fcf8b7ac5367ca9/db7f4/tim-carmody..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/6443e4e5c24d116d2fcf8b7ac5367ca9/cbeb2/tim-carmody..jpg 72w,\n/mith-static/static/6443e4e5c24d116d2fcf8b7ac5367ca9/896a8/tim-carmody..jpg 143w,\n/mith-static/static/6443e4e5c24d116d2fcf8b7ac5367ca9/db7f4/tim-carmody..jpg 286w","sizes":"(min-width: 286px) 286px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/6443e4e5c24d116d2fcf8b7ac5367ca9/de323/tim-carmody..webp 72w,\n/mith-static/static/6443e4e5c24d116d2fcf8b7ac5367ca9/7683a/tim-carmody..webp 143w,\n/mith-static/static/6443e4e5c24d116d2fcf8b7ac5367ca9/64685/tim-carmody..webp 286w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 286px) 286px, 100vw"}]},"width":286,"height":286}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"department":null,"institution":"University of Pennsylvania","title":"Critical Writing Program fellow","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"tim-carmody"}}]}}]}}],"linked_links":null,"video_id":"175726856","video_url":"https://vimeo.com/175726856","livestream":null,"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"department":null,"institution":"University of Pennsylvania","title":"Critical Writing Program fellow","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"tim-carmody"}}]}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
