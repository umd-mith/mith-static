It is perhaps useful to make comparisons to film studies, where scholarship about the role of labor, organizational communication, institutional rhetoric, domestic politics, systems of credit, and “below the line” production activities has long challenged the model of the lone auteur. Just as women were critical actors in the Hollywood saga in intensely collaborative roles such as casting and editing, pioneering work in computer graphics, virtual reality, interactive entertainment, and multimedia publishing reflected a collective production culture and its associated conflicts. Media studies could still do much more to recover social histories currently stored in informal archives, often in obsolete file formats, to support feminist scholarship, as part of the larger theoretical project of acknowledging the material, embodied, affective, situated, and labor-intensive character of technology. This talk focuses specifically on manual labor in the supply chain of digital media and how many hands don’t make light work.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Elizabeth Losh Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"A Woman’s Touch","talk_subtitle":"Manual Labor, Pink Collar Workers, and Feminist New Media Origin Stories","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2015-10-06T16:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Elizabeth  Losh","website":null,"twitter":"lizlosh","slug":"elizabeth-losh","new_id":427,"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#d8d8d8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/6cabf193f1dd22a77c200b0352125d5d/dfa9f/Elizabeth_Losh..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/6cabf193f1dd22a77c200b0352125d5d/74471/Elizabeth_Losh..jpg 125w,\n/mith-static/static/6cabf193f1dd22a77c200b0352125d5d/7d045/Elizabeth_Losh..jpg 250w,\n/mith-static/static/6cabf193f1dd22a77c200b0352125d5d/dfa9f/Elizabeth_Losh..jpg 500w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/6cabf193f1dd22a77c200b0352125d5d/df63e/Elizabeth_Losh..webp 125w,\n/mith-static/static/6cabf193f1dd22a77c200b0352125d5d/2eaab/Elizabeth_Losh..webp 250w,\n/mith-static/static/6cabf193f1dd22a77c200b0352125d5d/44ea1/Elizabeth_Losh..webp 500w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"}]},"width":500,"height":392}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"department":null,"institution":"College of William and Mary","title":"Associate Professor of English and American Studies","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"elizabeth-losh"}}]}}]}}],"linked_links":[{"data":{"id":211,"title":"Beyond Biometrics: Feminist Media Theory Looks at </em>Selfiecity</em>","url":"http://d25rsf93iwlmgu.cloudfront.net/downloads/Liz_Losh_BeyondBiometrics.pdf","type":"file_link"}},{"data":{"id":212,"title":"View Sutori Recap","url":"https://www.sutori.com/story/liz-losh-digital-dialogue-at-mith-october-6-2015","type":"file_link"}}],"video_id":"142186343","video_url":"https://vimeo.com/142186343","livestream":null,"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"department":null,"institution":"College of William and Mary","title":"Associate Professor of English and American Studies","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"elizabeth-losh"}}]}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["196133661","2857345991"],"slicesMap":{}}
