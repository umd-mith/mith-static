It also has a blossoming industry that includes “text analytics” widely used in national security studies.\nThat type of DH research usually means digitizing massive amounts of texts, constructing databases, organizing information, and representing the patterns into meaningful conclusions. The researchers mine data in texts to make existing texts more accessible, and to discover connections and patterns difficult to decipher without computing power and information design.In the midst of building a databases for two digital humanities project, Dr. Craig Saper realized that the interfaces his team had constructed online had a more profound impact on how one read the texts than the use of the database alone.\nThe online interface changed how one read — even changed the essence of what one read. The futures of reading using new devices, like e-readers, will have consequences for the definition and practice of what we call reading.\nSaper’s presentation for MITH’s Digital Dialogues will look at four of his major digital humanities projects – two online and two just starting – on r\\e\\a\\d/i/n/g/ as a publishing practice and potential strategic alliances among the campuses on the university of Maryland system.</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Craig Saper Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"R\\e\\a\\d/i/n/g/ as a Publishing Practice","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2012-03-27T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2012-03-27T17:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"name":"Craig Saper","affiliations":[{"title":"Center for History and New Media","department":null,"institution":"George Mason University"}],"website":null,"twitter":null,"slug":"craig-saper","new_id":412,"headshot":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#180808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/df58bf676345b59c9a53b123b6b04dc9/61b58/Z9qomHxxtApPE4tLDSzQHe511yB184AwG1U_SXwo2_M.jpg","srcSet":"/static/df58bf676345b59c9a53b123b6b04dc9/c3c9b/Z9qomHxxtApPE4tLDSzQHe511yB184AwG1U_SXwo2_M.jpg 157w,\n/static/df58bf676345b59c9a53b123b6b04dc9/3578f/Z9qomHxxtApPE4tLDSzQHe511yB184AwG1U_SXwo2_M.jpg 314w,\n/static/df58bf676345b59c9a53b123b6b04dc9/61b58/Z9qomHxxtApPE4tLDSzQHe511yB184AwG1U_SXwo2_M.jpg 628w","sizes":"(min-width: 628px) 628px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/df58bf676345b59c9a53b123b6b04dc9/fdabe/Z9qomHxxtApPE4tLDSzQHe511yB184AwG1U_SXwo2_M.webp 157w,\n/static/df58bf676345b59c9a53b123b6b04dc9/50d5d/Z9qomHxxtApPE4tLDSzQHe511yB184AwG1U_SXwo2_M.webp 314w,\n/static/df58bf676345b59c9a53b123b6b04dc9/ea774/Z9qomHxxtApPE4tLDSzQHe511yB184AwG1U_SXwo2_M.webp 628w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 628px) 628px, 100vw"}]},"width":628,"height":683}}},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p><strong>Craig Saper</strong> (csaper<at>umbc<dot>edu) is on the faculty of the Language, Literacy, &#x26; Culture multi-disciplinary doctoral program at UMBC, and has published widely, and in multimodal formats, on the digital humanities.
