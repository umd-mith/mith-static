Until recently, this has not been a difficult question, but the creation of massive databases of digitized documents has begun to enable researchers to explore new possibilities. Text can be seen not just as words to be read but as data to be measured. In this dialog, Mimno will present some examples of the use of computational methods to analyze 100 years of journal articles from JStor. Mimno will then consider how to extend this case study to general practice. How can we empower scholars to formulate hypotheses and test them experimentally, all while maintaining appropriate caution and skepticism?</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"David Mimno Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Computational Historiography in a Century of Classics Journals","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2011-09-27T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2011-09-27T17:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"David  Mimno","website":null,"twitter":"dmimno","slug":"david-mimno","new_id":418,"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/3cbb638b35d4d4a26d3c14f606e3f123/f505e/david-mimno..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/3cbb638b35d4d4a26d3c14f606e3f123/df74b/david-mimno..jpg 63w,\n/mith-static/static/3cbb638b35d4d4a26d3c14f606e3f123/8bb35/david-mimno..jpg 125w,\n/mith-static/static/3cbb638b35d4d4a26d3c14f606e3f123/f505e/david-mimno..jpg 250w","sizes":"(min-width: 250px) 250px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/3cbb638b35d4d4a26d3c14f606e3f123/74c72/david-mimno..webp 63w,\n/mith-static/static/3cbb638b35d4d4a26d3c14f606e3f123/d66e1/david-mimno..webp 125w,\n/mith-static/static/3cbb638b35d4d4a26d3c14f606e3f123/e7160/david-mimno..webp 250w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 250px) 250px, 100vw"}]},"width":250,"height":250}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"department":null,"institution":"Princeton University","title":"Postdoctoral Researcher","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"david-mimno"}}]}}]}}],"linked_links":[{"data":{"id":173,"title":"Watch Keynote","url":"http://mith.umd.edu/digitaldialogues/slides/dd_2011_09_27.key","type":"file_link"}}],"video_id":"178061429","video_url":"https://vimeo.com/178061429","livestream":null,"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"department":null,"institution":"Princeton University","title":"Postdoctoral Researcher","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"david-mimno"}}]}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
