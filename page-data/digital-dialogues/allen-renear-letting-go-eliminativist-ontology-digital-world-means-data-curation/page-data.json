Accommodating these strategies will require developing ontologies that revise our common sense conceptual schemes in ways that are sure to be unsettling. These ontologies may be more accurate, and, in the long run they may even be more serviceable, but they will not be familiar, and they will require substantial revision of our descriptions of common activities and processes.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Allen Renear Digital Dialogue","talk_title":" An Eliminativist Ontology of the Digital World—and What It Means for Data Curation","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2013-10-15T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2013-10-15T17:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Allen  Renear","website":null,"twitter":null,"slug":"allen-renear","new_id":198,"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/9f702503c8472ab37f5bc320c3c9159c/5ffe0/renear_2012_cropped_portrait..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/9f702503c8472ab37f5bc320c3c9159c/a70de/renear_2012_cropped_portrait..jpg 737w,\n/mith-static/static/9f702503c8472ab37f5bc320c3c9159c/31225/renear_2012_cropped_portrait..jpg 1473w,\n/mith-static/static/9f702503c8472ab37f5bc320c3c9159c/5ffe0/renear_2012_cropped_portrait..jpg 2946w","sizes":"(min-width: 2946px) 2946px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/9f702503c8472ab37f5bc320c3c9159c/09da6/renear_2012_cropped_portrait..webp 737w,\n/mith-static/static/9f702503c8472ab37f5bc320c3c9159c/3651a/renear_2012_cropped_portrait..webp 1473w,\n/mith-static/static/9f702503c8472ab37f5bc320c3c9159c/aebc1/renear_2012_cropped_portrait..webp 2946w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 2946px) 2946px, 100vw"}]},"width":2946,"height":2831}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"department":"Graduate School of Library and Information Science (GSLIS)","institution":"University of Illinois","title":"Interim Dean and Professor","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"allen-renear"}}]}}]}}],"linked_links":[{"data":{"id":203,"title":"Watch the Video","url":"https://vimeo.com/77519454","type":"file_link"}},{"data":{"id":204,"title":"Presentation Slides","url":"http://web.archive.org/web/20131230052832/http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/UMDrenear2013rev1.pdf","type":"attachment"}}],"video_id":"77519454","video_url":"https://vimeo.com/77519454","livestream":null,"sponsors":[{"data":{"name":"University of Maryland Libraries","website":"lib.umd.edu","type":"Internal","slug":"umdlib"}}],"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"department":"Graduate School of Library and Information Science (GSLIS)","institution":"University of Illinois","title":"Interim Dean and Professor","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"allen-renear"}}]}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["196133661","2857345991"],"slicesMap":{}}
