Current projects at IATH will be used as examples, including Virtual Williamsburg, the Digital Forma Urbis Project, and Rome Reborn. In the conclusion, new directions and challenges in this field will be discussed, including populating models of buildings and cities with people and their activities; using models as tools for discovery (and not simply as illustrations of previous knowledge); and the online collection and dissemination of real-time 3D models on the Internet.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Bernard Frischer Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Making Culture Virtual: Recent 3D Modeling Projects at the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2008-03-04T17:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Bernard Frischer","website":"https://frischer.org","twitter":null,"slug":"bernard-frischer","new_id":213,"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#081828","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/13e33aaabb536226baef87d4f1d95669/25fb0/Bernie_Frischer_-_Professor_of_Informatics..jpg","srcSet":"/static/13e33aaabb536226baef87d4f1d95669/18b47/Bernie_Frischer_-_Professor_of_Informatics..jpg 77w,\n/static/13e33aaabb536226baef87d4f1d95669/116cb/Bernie_Frischer_-_Professor_of_Informatics..jpg 154w,\n/static/13e33aaabb536226baef87d4f1d95669/25fb0/Bernie_Frischer_-_Professor_of_Informatics..jpg 308w","sizes":"(min-width: 308px) 308px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/13e33aaabb536226baef87d4f1d95669/8da7f/Bernie_Frischer_-_Professor_of_Informatics..webp 77w,\n/static/13e33aaabb536226baef87d4f1d95669/b2942/Bernie_Frischer_-_Professor_of_Informatics..webp 154w,\n/static/13e33aaabb536226baef87d4f1d95669/46581/Bernie_Frischer_-_Professor_of_Informatics..webp 308w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 308px) 308px, 100vw"}]},"width":308,"height":308}}},{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#3858a8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/d710b29013e638be05c5ff9937ec7da6/cc612/Bernard_Frischer..jpg","srcSet":"/static/d710b29013e638be05c5ff9937ec7da6/f164e/Bernard_Frischer..jpg 130w,\n/static/d710b29013e638be05c5ff9937ec7da6/1ac4a/Bernard_Frischer..jpg 259w,\n/static/d710b29013e638be05c5ff9937ec7da6/cc612/Bernard_Frischer..jpg 518w","sizes":"(min-width: 518px) 518px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/d710b29013e638be05c5ff9937ec7da6/39e5d/Bernard_Frischer..webp 130w,\n/static/d710b29013e638be05c5ff9937ec7da6/1d667/Bernard_Frischer..webp 259w,\n/static/d710b29013e638be05c5ff9937ec7da6/f26a3/Bernard_Frischer..webp 518w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 518px) 518px, 100vw"}]},"width":518,"height":700}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Bernard Frischer is a leading virtual archaeologist and the author of seven printed books, three e-books, and dozens of articles on virtual heritage, Classics, and the survival of the Classical world.
