This talk outlines the benefits offered by electronic editions and describes the steps taken by the author to develop an AJAX-based electronic edition of the 1998 musical Parade.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Doug Reside Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Byte By Byte, Putting It Together: Electronic Editions of Musical Theatre Texts","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2006-11-08T17:30:00.000Z","end":"2006-11-08T18:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Doug Reside","website":"http://nypl.orgstaff-profiles/doug-reside","twitter":null,"slug":"douglas-reside","new_id":29,"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/f84486fb33fd5787f4f4e6da4edf3ce5/3c367/Doug-Reside..jpg","srcSet":"/static/f84486fb33fd5787f4f4e6da4edf3ce5/19e71/Doug-Reside..jpg 128w,\n/static/f84486fb33fd5787f4f4e6da4edf3ce5/68974/Doug-Reside..jpg 256w,\n/static/f84486fb33fd5787f4f4e6da4edf3ce5/3c367/Doug-Reside..jpg 512w","sizes":"(min-width: 512px) 512px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/f84486fb33fd5787f4f4e6da4edf3ce5/6766a/Doug-Reside..webp 128w,\n/static/f84486fb33fd5787f4f4e6da4edf3ce5/22bfc/Doug-Reside..webp 256w,\n/static/f84486fb33fd5787f4f4e6da4edf3ce5/d689f/Doug-Reside..webp 512w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 512px) 512px, 100vw"}]},"width":512,"height":512}}},{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/6cd600f0dc74ff762ed72a74d036d209/85f90/staff_dreside..png","srcSet":"/static/6cd600f0dc74ff762ed72a74d036d209/59c6d/staff_dreside..png 29w,\n/static/6cd600f0dc74ff762ed72a74d036d209/e3e5e/staff_dreside..png 58w,\n/static/6cd600f0dc74ff762ed72a74d036d209/85f90/staff_dreside..png 115w","sizes":"(min-width: 115px) 115px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/6cd600f0dc74ff762ed72a74d036d209/bc2ec/staff_dreside..webp 29w,\n/static/6cd600f0dc74ff762ed72a74d036d209/6262e/staff_dreside..webp 58w,\n/static/6cd600f0dc74ff762ed72a74d036d209/1f876/staff_dreside..webp 115w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 115px) 115px, 100vw"}]},"width":115,"height":150}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p><strong>Doug Reside</strong> is Assistant Director of the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH).
