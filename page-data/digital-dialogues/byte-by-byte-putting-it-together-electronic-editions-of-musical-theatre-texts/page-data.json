This presentation will explore the ways in which electronic editions of musicals would not only be of use to musical theatre scholars, but might also help to develop a wider audience for artistically-minded (as opposed to commercially-driven) musicals. This talk outlines the benefits offered by electronic editions and describes the steps taken by the author to develop an AJAX-based electronic edition of the 1998 musical Parade.</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Doug Reside Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Byte By Byte, Putting It Together: Electronic Editions of Musical Theatre Texts","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2006-11-08T17:30:00.000Z","end":"2006-11-08T18:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"name":"Doug Reside","affiliations":[{"title":"Assistant Director","department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"website":"http://nypl.orgstaff-profiles/doug-reside","twitter":null,"slug":"douglas-reside","new_id":29,"headshot":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/f84486fb33fd5787f4f4e6da4edf3ce5/3c367/Doug-Reside.jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/f84486fb33fd5787f4f4e6da4edf3ce5/19e71/Doug-Reside.jpg 128w,\n/mith-static/static/f84486fb33fd5787f4f4e6da4edf3ce5/68974/Doug-Reside.jpg 256w,\n/mith-static/static/f84486fb33fd5787f4f4e6da4edf3ce5/3c367/Doug-Reside.jpg 512w","sizes":"(min-width: 512px) 512px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/f84486fb33fd5787f4f4e6da4edf3ce5/6766a/Doug-Reside.webp 128w,\n/mith-static/static/f84486fb33fd5787f4f4e6da4edf3ce5/22bfc/Doug-Reside.webp 256w,\n/mith-static/static/f84486fb33fd5787f4f4e6da4edf3ce5/d689f/Doug-Reside.webp 512w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 512px) 512px, 100vw"}]},"width":512,"height":512}}},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Doug Reside is the Curator of the Billy Rose Theatre Division and manages all aspects of the division’s collections and public services.
