Alexandrina Agloro, media artist and assistant professor, will discuss the landscape of design and digital humanities projects geared toward social change, and share some of her current projects. Each of these projects incorporate pieces of reimagining archives, culturally relevant education, game development, and tools for reproductive justice. These projects were developed through a participatory design methodology and model how we think about organizing and implementing activism. The second part of this talk will turn to community-engaged game development and discuss two games, <em>The Resisters</em>, an alternate reality game about social movement history, and <em>Vukuzenzele</em>, a videogame about reblocking informal settlements in South Africa. These games are examples of the opportunities and challenges in applied game design and how game mechanics can be utilized as instruments for engagement and action.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Alexandrina Agloro Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Liberation by Design","talk_subtitle":"Interactive Media & Community-Engaged Making","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2017-10-31T16:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Alexandrina  Agloro","website":"https://agloro.org","twitter":"a_game","slug":"alexandrina-agloro","new_id":374,"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#585818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/de1d6d4318b9a36a0e411a7a8fb82dd3/2d8f4/speaker_alexandrina-agloro..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/de1d6d4318b9a36a0e411a7a8fb82dd3/db60f/speaker_alexandrina-agloro..jpg 188w,\n/mith-static/static/de1d6d4318b9a36a0e411a7a8fb82dd3/e91b5/speaker_alexandrina-agloro..jpg 375w,\n/mith-static/static/de1d6d4318b9a36a0e411a7a8fb82dd3/2d8f4/speaker_alexandrina-agloro..jpg 750w","sizes":"(min-width: 750px) 750px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/de1d6d4318b9a36a0e411a7a8fb82dd3/9b5bd/speaker_alexandrina-agloro..webp 188w,\n/mith-static/static/de1d6d4318b9a36a0e411a7a8fb82dd3/1233d/speaker_alexandrina-agloro..webp 375w,\n/mith-static/static/de1d6d4318b9a36a0e411a7a8fb82dd3/3df03/speaker_alexandrina-agloro..webp 750w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 750px) 750px, 100vw"}]},"width":750,"height":495.99999999999994}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Alexandrina is a game designer, community-based researcher, and media artist who believes in the possibilities of the decolonial imaginary using digital media as an emancipatory tool.
