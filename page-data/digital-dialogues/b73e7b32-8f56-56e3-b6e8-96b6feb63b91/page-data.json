Accommodating these strategies will require developing ontologies that revise our common sense conceptual schemes in ways that are sure to be unsettling. These ontologies may be more accurate, and, in the long run they may even be more serviceable, but they will not be familiar, and they will require substantial revision of our descriptions of common activities and processes.</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Allen Renear Digital Dialogue","talk_title":" An Eliminativist Ontology of the Digital World—and What It Means for Data Curation","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2013-10-15T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2013-10-15T17:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"name":"Allen Renear","affiliations":[{"title":"Interim Dean and Professor","department":"Graduate School of Library and Information Science (GSLIS)","institution":"University of Illinois"}],"website":null,"twitter":null,"slug":"allen-renear","new_id":198,"headshot":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/9f702503c8472ab37f5bc320c3c9159c/5ffe0/3URTRtjItYiVpjo4GOG26xvBvj_H3ZzPJbaFzyRwP3M.jpg","srcSet":"/static/9f702503c8472ab37f5bc320c3c9159c/a70de/3URTRtjItYiVpjo4GOG26xvBvj_H3ZzPJbaFzyRwP3M.jpg 737w,\n/static/9f702503c8472ab37f5bc320c3c9159c/31225/3URTRtjItYiVpjo4GOG26xvBvj_H3ZzPJbaFzyRwP3M.jpg 1473w,\n/static/9f702503c8472ab37f5bc320c3c9159c/5ffe0/3URTRtjItYiVpjo4GOG26xvBvj_H3ZzPJbaFzyRwP3M.jpg 2946w","sizes":"(min-width: 2946px) 2946px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/9f702503c8472ab37f5bc320c3c9159c/09da6/3URTRtjItYiVpjo4GOG26xvBvj_H3ZzPJbaFzyRwP3M.webp 737w,\n/static/9f702503c8472ab37f5bc320c3c9159c/3651a/3URTRtjItYiVpjo4GOG26xvBvj_H3ZzPJbaFzyRwP3M.webp 1473w,\n/static/9f702503c8472ab37f5bc320c3c9159c/aebc1/3URTRtjItYiVpjo4GOG26xvBvj_H3ZzPJbaFzyRwP3M.webp 2946w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 2946px) 2946px, 100vw"}]},"width":2946,"height":2831}}},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p><strong>Allen Renear</strong> is Interim Dean and Professor at GSLIS. He teaches courses and leads research in information modeling, data curation, digital humanities, scientific publishing, and the conceptual foundations of information organization. Prior to coming to the Graduate School of Library and Information Science, he was the Director of the Brown University Scholarly Technology Group. Dr. Renear received an AB from Bowdoin College and an MA and PhD from Brown University. His research is typically concerned with foundational issues in the development of formal ontologies for scientific and cultural objects, and the exploitation of those ontologies in data curation, scientific publishing and information system design. Recently his work has focused on fundamental issues in the curation of scientific datasets and conceptual models for data management and preservation. This includes topics such as levels of abstraction and encoding, identity, ontology, etc. His projects are located at the Center for Informatics Research in Science and Scholarship (<a href=\"http://cirss.lis.illinois.edu/\">CIRSS</a>) and have been funded by NSF and IMLS.</p>"}}}],"links":[{"id":203,"title":"Watch the Video","url":"https://vimeo.com/77519454","type":"file_link"},{"id":204,"title":"Presentation Slides","url":"http://web.archive.org/web/20131230052832/http://mith.umd.edu/wp-content/uploads/UMDrenear2013rev1.pdf","type":"attachment"}],"video_id":"77519454","video_url":"https://vimeo.com/77519454","livestream":null,"sponsors":[{"name":"University of Maryland Libraries","website":"lib.umd.edu","type":"Internal","slug":"umdlib"}],"partners":[],"disciplines":[],"methods":[]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
