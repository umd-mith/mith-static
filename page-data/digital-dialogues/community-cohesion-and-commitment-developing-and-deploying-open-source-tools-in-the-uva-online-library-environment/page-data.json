U.Va.’s commitment to the project includes the definition of metadata standards, the creation of search and discovery interfaces, and the development and implementation of multiple Hydra “heads” such as the interface and workflow in use for the U.Va. institutional repository. This talk will provide a brief overview of the Hydra Project and the tools under development, describe some of the processes and challenges for development teams working within a library setting, discuss the value of having a Digital Humanities R&#x26;D group (the Scholars’ Lab) embedded in this same setting, and the types of “alt-ac” positions, roles, and responsibilities that can be found in this environment.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Julie Meloni Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Community, Cohesion, and Commitment: Developing and Deploying Open Source Tools in the UVa Online Library Environment","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2011-02-22T17:30:00.000Z","end":"2011-02-22T18:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Julie  Meloni","website":null,"twitter":null,"slug":"julie-meloni","new_id":466,"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"department":null,"institution":"University of Virginia","title":"Chief Architect of the Online Library Environent","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"julie-meloni"}}]}}]}}],"linked_links":null,"video_id":"175726549","video_url":"https://vimeo.com/175726549","livestream":null,"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"department":null,"institution":"University of Virginia","title":"Chief Architect of the Online Library Environent","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"julie-meloni"}}]}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["196133661","2857345991"],"slicesMap":{}}
