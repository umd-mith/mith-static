THATCamp has become an annual unconference hosted by GMU, and inspired regional digital humanities unconferences in France, Texas, Michigan, Ohio, and California. Lester will also draw from his experience engaging existing communities of interest through social networking sites to discuss the changing landscape of crowdsourcing and suggest ways that digital humanists can engage the public to answer research questions.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Dave Lester Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Collaborative Approaches to Digital Humanities: Unconferences and Crowdsourcing ","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2010-02-16T17:30:00.000Z","end":"2010-02-16T17:30:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Dave  Lester","website":"http://davelester.org","twitter":"davelester","slug":"dave-lester","new_id":21,"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#483838","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/917664135d0266e68defc9637eb9bb24/47930/Dave_Lester_(davelester)__Twitter..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/917664135d0266e68defc9637eb9bb24/e07e1/Dave_Lester_(davelester)__Twitter..jpg 100w,\n/mith-static/static/917664135d0266e68defc9637eb9bb24/dd515/Dave_Lester_(davelester)__Twitter..jpg 200w,\n/mith-static/static/917664135d0266e68defc9637eb9bb24/47930/Dave_Lester_(davelester)__Twitter..jpg 400w","sizes":"(min-width: 400px) 400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/917664135d0266e68defc9637eb9bb24/d8057/Dave_Lester_(davelester)__Twitter..webp 100w,\n/mith-static/static/917664135d0266e68defc9637eb9bb24/2e34e/Dave_Lester_(davelester)__Twitter..webp 200w,\n/mith-static/static/917664135d0266e68defc9637eb9bb24/416c3/Dave_Lester_(davelester)__Twitter..webp 400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 400px) 400px, 100vw"}]},"width":400,"height":400}}},{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#683828","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/af2fd78f414d9c7c1bf154d8e0dd424b/dd515/Dave%20Lester..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/af2fd78f414d9c7c1bf154d8e0dd424b/6ac16/Dave%20Lester..jpg 50w,\n/mith-static/static/af2fd78f414d9c7c1bf154d8e0dd424b/e07e1/Dave%20Lester..jpg 100w,\n/mith-static/static/af2fd78f414d9c7c1bf154d8e0dd424b/dd515/Dave%20Lester..jpg 200w","sizes":"(min-width: 200px) 200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/af2fd78f414d9c7c1bf154d8e0dd424b/dbc4a/Dave%20Lester..webp 50w,\n/mith-static/static/af2fd78f414d9c7c1bf154d8e0dd424b/d8057/Dave%20Lester..webp 100w,\n/mith-static/static/af2fd78f414d9c7c1bf154d8e0dd424b/2e34e/Dave%20Lester..webp 200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 200px) 200px, 100vw"}]},"width":200,"height":200}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Assistant Director","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"dave-lester"}}]}}]}}],"linked_links":null,"video_id":"178064929","video_url":"https://vimeo.com/178064929","livestream":null,"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Assistant Director","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"dave-lester"}}]}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["196133661","2857345991"],"slicesMap":{}}
