More detail is available <a href=\"http://www.newsdesk.umd.edu/culture/release.cfm?ArticleID=1620\">here</a>.\nThe nearly $120,000 NEH grant will provide initial funds for one year to create a technical proof of concept \"working model\" for the project by digitizing all 32 pre-1641 versions of Hamlet held by the participating libraries. \"The JISC/NEH initiative gave us the opportunity and the incentive to attempt a truly international, collaborative, digital project,\" says Folger Project Director RICHARD KUHTA. \"The guidelines challenged us to think collectively about what was possible, and to realize a shared ambition. It was exactly the prompt we needed to launch a conversation that transformed geographically distant collections into partner institutions.\" NEIL FRAISTAT adds, \"We are proud to have as partners such institutions as the Folger Shakespeare Library, the Huntington Library, the British Library, and the Bodleian Library of Oxford University. This grant caps what has been an extraordinary year for MITH, in which it has received five major grants, covering the gamut from Shakespeare's Quartos to the preservation of Virtual Worlds.\"\nIn this Digital Dialogue, we will introduce the project to the university community, solicit initial feedback, and discuss ways to involve interested constituents as our work progresses. The discussion will be led by NEIL FRAISTAT (Professor of English and Director, MITH), JIM KUHN (Head of Collection Information Services, Folger), RICHARD KHUTA (Librarian, Folger), and DOUG RESIDE (Assistant Director, MITH).</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Neil Fraistat, Jim Kuhn, Richard Kuhta, Doug Reside Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Introducing the Shakespeare's Quartos Project","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2008-04-08T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2008-04-08T17:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Neil  Fraistat","website":null,"twitter":"fraistat","slug":"neil-fraistat","new_id":22,"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#081808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/132efadff15655edd6d1a28ea92b5a8f/0fdf4/neil-fraistat..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/132efadff15655edd6d1a28ea92b5a8f/91a6d/neil-fraistat..jpg 75w,\n/mith-static/static/132efadff15655edd6d1a28ea92b5a8f/96deb/neil-fraistat..jpg 150w,\n/mith-static/static/132efadff15655edd6d1a28ea92b5a8f/0fdf4/neil-fraistat..jpg 300w","sizes":"(min-width: 300px) 300px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/132efadff15655edd6d1a28ea92b5a8f/18188/neil-fraistat..webp 75w,\n/mith-static/static/132efadff15655edd6d1a28ea92b5a8f/c65bc/neil-fraistat..webp 150w,\n/mith-static/static/132efadff15655edd6d1a28ea92b5a8f/078c3/neil-fraistat..webp 300w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 300px) 300px, 100vw"}]},"width":300,"height":300}}}]},"affiliations":[{"data":{"department":"MITH","institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Director","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":null,"slug":"neil-fraistat"}}]}}]}},{"data":{"name":"Jim  Kuhn","website":null,"twitter":null,"slug":"jim-kuhn","new_id":277,"affiliations":[{"data":{"department":null,"institution":"Folger Shakespeare Library","title":"Head of Collection Information Services","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":null,"slug":"jim-kuhn"}}]}}]}},{"data":{"name":"Richard  Kuhta","website":null,"twitter":null,"slug":"richard-kuhta","new_id":334,"affiliations":[{"data":{"department":null,"institution":"Folger Shakespeare Library","title":"Librarian","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":null,"slug":"richard-kuhta"}}]}}]}},{"data":{"name":"Doug  Reside","website":"http://nypl.orgstaff-profiles/doug-reside","twitter":null,"slug":"douglas-reside","new_id":29,"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/f84486fb33fd5787f4f4e6da4edf3ce5/3c367/Doug-Reside..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/f84486fb33fd5787f4f4e6da4edf3ce5/19e71/Doug-Reside..jpg 128w,\n/mith-static/static/f84486fb33fd5787f4f4e6da4edf3ce5/68974/Doug-Reside..jpg 256w,\n/mith-static/static/f84486fb33fd5787f4f4e6da4edf3ce5/3c367/Doug-Reside..jpg 512w","sizes":"(min-width: 512px) 512px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/f84486fb33fd5787f4f4e6da4edf3ce5/6766a/Doug-Reside..webp 128w,\n/mith-static/static/f84486fb33fd5787f4f4e6da4edf3ce5/22bfc/Doug-Reside..webp 256w,\n/mith-static/static/f84486fb33fd5787f4f4e6da4edf3ce5/d689f/Doug-Reside..webp 512w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 512px) 512px, 100vw"}]},"width":512,"height":512}}},{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/6cd600f0dc74ff762ed72a74d036d209/85f90/staff_dreside..png","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/6cd600f0dc74ff762ed72a74d036d209/59c6d/staff_dreside..png 29w,\n/mith-static/static/6cd600f0dc74ff762ed72a74d036d209/e3e5e/staff_dreside..png 58w,\n/mith-static/static/6cd600f0dc74ff762ed72a74d036d209/85f90/staff_dreside..png 115w","sizes":"(min-width: 115px) 115px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/6cd600f0dc74ff762ed72a74d036d209/bc2ec/staff_dreside..webp 29w,\n/mith-static/static/6cd600f0dc74ff762ed72a74d036d209/6262e/staff_dreside..webp 58w,\n/mith-static/static/6cd600f0dc74ff762ed72a74d036d209/1f876/staff_dreside..webp 115w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 115px) 115px, 100vw"}]},"width":115,"height":150}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p><strong>Doug Reside</strong> is Assistant Director of the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH).
