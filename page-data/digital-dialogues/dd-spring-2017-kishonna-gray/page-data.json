This is performed via pixelated minstrelsy by depicting Black and Brown bodies as objects to be destroyed and women as bodies to be dominated. The mediated story of Black characters is limited and situated within buffoonery (comedy) or crime and gaming is not exempt. Media outlets have created essentialist notions about Blackness and what it means to have an ‘authentic’ Black experience. And because there are limited counter-narratives, this singular story only confirms hegemonic notions of what it means to be Black.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Kishonna L Gray Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Buffoons, Goons, and Pixelated Minstrels","talk_subtitle":"The Digital Story That Games Tell ","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2017-02-07T17:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Kishonna  L Gray","website":"http://kishonnagray.com","twitter":"KishonnaGray","slug":"kishonna-l-gray","new_id":478,"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/38241ce827eca0da5ca208ce38fd490f/1e618/Kishonna_Gray..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/38241ce827eca0da5ca208ce38fd490f/0132d/Kishonna_Gray..jpg 400w,\n/mith-static/static/38241ce827eca0da5ca208ce38fd490f/20b93/Kishonna_Gray..jpg 800w,\n/mith-static/static/38241ce827eca0da5ca208ce38fd490f/1e618/Kishonna_Gray..jpg 1600w","sizes":"(min-width: 1600px) 1600px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/38241ce827eca0da5ca208ce38fd490f/47294/Kishonna_Gray..webp 400w,\n/mith-static/static/38241ce827eca0da5ca208ce38fd490f/56f2e/Kishonna_Gray..webp 800w,\n/mith-static/static/38241ce827eca0da5ca208ce38fd490f/94e9c/Kishonna_Gray..webp 1600w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1600px) 1600px, 100vw"}]},"width":1600,"height":1067}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"department":null,"institution":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology","title":"Martin Luther King Jr. Scholar and Visiting Professor of Comparative Media Studies and Women & Gender Studies","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"kishonna-l-gray"}}]}}]}}],"linked_links":[{"data":{"id":244,"title":"Storify Link","url":"https://storify.com/digdialog/kishonna-gray-digital-dialogue-february-7-2017","type":"file_link"}},{"data":{"id":245,"title":"Kishonna Gray Presentation Slides","url":"https://archive.mith.umd.edu/mith-2020/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Kishonna-Gray-Presentation-Slides.pdf","type":"attachment"}}],"video_id":"204398478","video_url":"https://vimeo.com/204398478","livestream":null,"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":[{"data":{"term":"African and African American Studies","type":"Discipline"}}],"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"department":null,"institution":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology","title":"Martin Luther King Jr. Scholar and Visiting Professor of Comparative Media Studies and Women & Gender Studies","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"kishonna-l-gray"}}]}},{"data":{"department":"Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society","institution":"Harvard University","title":"Fellow","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"kishonna-l-gray"}}]}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
