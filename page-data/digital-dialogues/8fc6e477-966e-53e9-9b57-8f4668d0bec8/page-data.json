These studies have identified major challenges regarding technology infrastructure, institutional and business models, and social and legal frameworks, which need to be addressed to achieve long-term reliable access to digital information. In this talk, we will give a brief overview of our approach, called ADAPT (Approach to Digital Archiving and Preservation Technology), to build a platform-independent infrastructure based on a set of reconfigurable tools that use open standards and Web technologies. Our approach can easily accommodate emerging standards and policies, and will evolve gracefully as the underlying technologies change. These tools have been coordinated with our collaborators at the National Archives, the Library of Congress, and the San Diego Supercomputer Center.</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Joseph JaJa Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Novel Tools for Digital Archiving and Preservation","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2007-10-30T16:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"name":"Joseph JaJa","affiliations":[{"title":"Professor","department":"Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Institute for Advanced Computer Studies (UMIACS)","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"website":null,"twitter":null,"slug":"joseph-jaja","new_id":464,"headshot":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#e8e8e8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/4069ff2d875eec808a4dd430c82e1c0e/2b27b/Fiq9uMm1Wl7GC6ZBn3qrTFZwtrIF1dNFqe7jYuTbs84.jpg","srcSet":"/static/4069ff2d875eec808a4dd430c82e1c0e/f713e/Fiq9uMm1Wl7GC6ZBn3qrTFZwtrIF1dNFqe7jYuTbs84.jpg 55w,\n/static/4069ff2d875eec808a4dd430c82e1c0e/e2afd/Fiq9uMm1Wl7GC6ZBn3qrTFZwtrIF1dNFqe7jYuTbs84.jpg 110w,\n/static/4069ff2d875eec808a4dd430c82e1c0e/2b27b/Fiq9uMm1Wl7GC6ZBn3qrTFZwtrIF1dNFqe7jYuTbs84.jpg 220w","sizes":"(min-width: 220px) 220px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/4069ff2d875eec808a4dd430c82e1c0e/938d3/Fiq9uMm1Wl7GC6ZBn3qrTFZwtrIF1dNFqe7jYuTbs84.webp 55w,\n/static/4069ff2d875eec808a4dd430c82e1c0e/8c6ff/Fiq9uMm1Wl7GC6ZBn3qrTFZwtrIF1dNFqe7jYuTbs84.webp 110w,\n/static/4069ff2d875eec808a4dd430c82e1c0e/4c27b/Fiq9uMm1Wl7GC6ZBn3qrTFZwtrIF1dNFqe7jYuTbs84.webp 220w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 220px) 220px, 100vw"}]},"width":220,"height":220}}}}],"links":[],"video_id":null,"video_url":null,"livestream":null,"sponsors":[],"partners":[],"disciplines":[],"methods":[]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
