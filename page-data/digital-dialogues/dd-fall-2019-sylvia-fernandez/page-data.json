It is crucial to reclaim the humanity of communities, such as the ones along the Mexico-U.S. border, by critically contextualizing and reshaping knowledge production through the use of digital methods and tools, as well as collaborative practices. Nevertheless, as a member of the border community, it is necessary to question and consider alternative ways to work with and without the institution- and university-based initiatives, that own, control and direct the material, structure and meaning of DH projects connected to personal representations and/or critical issues. Based on my experience, as cofounder of Borderlands Archive Cartography and team member of United Fronteras, I will discuss the importance of tracing, recompiling and documenting the cultural, literary and digital record of the binational-transnational area of the U.S.-Mexico border, in order to bring to the forefront the various ways in which historical realities, past and present socio-political conditions, and local experiences of this region are being imagined, showcased, studied and interpreted.</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Sylvia Fernandez Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Behind the Line","talk_subtitle":"Digitally Rethinking and Restructuring Geopolitical Borders and its Surroundings","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2019-10-22T16:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"name":"Sylvia Fernandez","affiliations":[{"title":"Ph.D Candidate","department":null,"institution":"University of Houston"}],"website":null,"twitter":"sferna109","slug":"sylvia-fernandez","new_id":536,"headshot":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#282828","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/5e9b17b767d630af5d4dfe918e7dfe3d/bbfdc/sylvia-fernandez.jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/5e9b17b767d630af5d4dfe918e7dfe3d/86e99/sylvia-fernandez.jpg 98w,\n/mith-static/static/5e9b17b767d630af5d4dfe918e7dfe3d/4253a/sylvia-fernandez.jpg 197w,\n/mith-static/static/5e9b17b767d630af5d4dfe918e7dfe3d/bbfdc/sylvia-fernandez.jpg 393w","sizes":"(min-width: 393px) 393px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/5e9b17b767d630af5d4dfe918e7dfe3d/f1ce5/sylvia-fernandez.webp 98w,\n/mith-static/static/5e9b17b767d630af5d4dfe918e7dfe3d/acead/sylvia-fernandez.webp 197w,\n/mith-static/static/5e9b17b767d630af5d4dfe918e7dfe3d/d987c/sylvia-fernandez.webp 393w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 393px) 393px, 100vw"}]},"width":393,"height":393}}},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Sylvia Fernández is a Ph.D. Candidate with the Department of Hispanic Studies at the University of Houston.
