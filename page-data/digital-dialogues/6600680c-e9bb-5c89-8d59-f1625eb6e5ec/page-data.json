In this talk, Professor Mills Kelly, Associate Director of the Center for History and New Media, will discuss the results of a recent course he taught called \"Lying About the Past\" in which his students created an online historical hoax that fooled a fair number of people (including several professors).

What lessons can we learn about teaching and digital culture from his experiences? Come to the talk and find out.</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Mills Kelly Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"What Happens When You Teach Students to Lie Online?","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2009-04-21T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2009-04-21T17:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"name":"Mills Kelly","affiliations":[{"title":"Associate Dean for Enrollment Development","department":null,"institution":"George Mason University"},{"title":"Associate Director","department":"Center for History and New Media","institution":"George Mason University"},{"title":"Associate Professor","department":"Department of History and Art History","institution":"George Mason University"}],"website":null,"twitter":null,"slug":"mills-kelly","new_id":504,"headshot":null,"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>T.
