They’ve long been shaped by their roles as substrates for and containers of mediation, and they’ve long reflected the logics, politics, and aesthetics of their prevailing communications technologies. I advocate for an “urban media archaeology,” a materialist, multisensory approach to exploring the deep material history – that is, a cultural materialist history that acknowledges the physicality, the “stuff” of history and culture – of our media cities. This talk offers a preview of <em>Deep Mapping the Media City</em>, a book forthcoming (in March 2015) from the University of Minnesota Press’s Forerunners series, in which I investigate our material urban spaces as infrastructures for mediation, and I propose that archaeological tools, like excavation and mapping, might help us to acknowledge and understand our smart, mediated cities in the longue durée.</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Shannon Mattern Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Strata of Sentience","talk_subtitle":"Deep Mapping the Media City","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2015-02-24T17:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"name":"Shannon Mattern","affiliations":[{"title":"Associate Professor of Media Studies","department":null,"institution":"The New School"}],"website":"https://wordsinspace.net","twitter":"shannonmattern","slug":"shannon-mattern","new_id":527,"headshot":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#e8e8e8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/883f63c7f47bfb97899475ac1bb4e9ff/def91/QJeDzbnPVaCwLBTd6hHDEJDGF7Iusr2qHnBdWU28h3s.jpg","srcSet":"/static/883f63c7f47bfb97899475ac1bb4e9ff/df91e/QJeDzbnPVaCwLBTd6hHDEJDGF7Iusr2qHnBdWU28h3s.jpg 131w,\n/static/883f63c7f47bfb97899475ac1bb4e9ff/9a46b/QJeDzbnPVaCwLBTd6hHDEJDGF7Iusr2qHnBdWU28h3s.jpg 263w,\n/static/883f63c7f47bfb97899475ac1bb4e9ff/def91/QJeDzbnPVaCwLBTd6hHDEJDGF7Iusr2qHnBdWU28h3s.jpg 525w","sizes":"(min-width: 525px) 525px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/883f63c7f47bfb97899475ac1bb4e9ff/1b701/QJeDzbnPVaCwLBTd6hHDEJDGF7Iusr2qHnBdWU28h3s.webp 131w,\n/static/883f63c7f47bfb97899475ac1bb4e9ff/90103/QJeDzbnPVaCwLBTd6hHDEJDGF7Iusr2qHnBdWU28h3s.webp 263w,\n/static/883f63c7f47bfb97899475ac1bb4e9ff/a7b62/QJeDzbnPVaCwLBTd6hHDEJDGF7Iusr2qHnBdWU28h3s.webp 525w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 525px) 525px, 100vw"}]},"width":525,"height":350}}},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Shannon Mattern is an Associate Professor in the School of Media Studies at The New School.
