Computer operations work has been written out of the story, but without it no computer would be useful. Information historians Thomas Haigh and Mark Priestley are writing it back in. This talk focused on ENIAC, the first general purpose electronic computer, based on research for their book <em>ENIAC in Action: Making and Remaking the Modern Computer</em>, published by MIT Press in January, 2016. They will explain that the women now celebrated as the “first computer programmers” were actually hired as computer operators and worked hands-on with the machine around the clock. Then they will look at business data processing work from the 1950s onward, exploring the growth of operations and facilities work during the mainframe era. Concluding comments will relate this historical material to the human work and physical infrastructure today vanishing from public view into the “cloud.”</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Thomas Haigh, Mark Priestley Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Working on ENIAC: The Lost Labors of the Information Age","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2016-02-18T17:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"Human-Computer Interaction Lab (2105 Hornbake, South Wing)","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Thomas Haigh","website":"https://tomandmaria.com/tom","twitter":null,"slug":"thomas-haigh","new_id":541,"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#181818","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/d3adbeec45782ed6fa8aa206fe412c00/cdddd/thomas-haigh..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/d3adbeec45782ed6fa8aa206fe412c00/c61c3/thomas-haigh..jpg 75w,\n/mith-static/static/d3adbeec45782ed6fa8aa206fe412c00/fa2a5/thomas-haigh..jpg 150w,\n/mith-static/static/d3adbeec45782ed6fa8aa206fe412c00/cdddd/thomas-haigh..jpg 300w","sizes":"(min-width: 300px) 300px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/d3adbeec45782ed6fa8aa206fe412c00/0e31b/thomas-haigh..webp 75w,\n/mith-static/static/d3adbeec45782ed6fa8aa206fe412c00/4c6e4/thomas-haigh..webp 150w,\n/mith-static/static/d3adbeec45782ed6fa8aa206fe412c00/8e42d/thomas-haigh..webp 300w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 300px) 300px, 100vw"}]},"width":300,"height":450}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Thomas Haigh received his Ph.D. in History and Sociology of Science from the University of Pennsylvania after earning two degrees in Computer Science from the University of Manchester.
