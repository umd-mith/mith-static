In response, some postcolonial and feminist scholars have approached DH from the margins of cultural and political life in order to encourage DH scholars to create and adopt methodologies that engage decolonial theory. Such methodologies consider how digital scholarship frames knowledge and knowledge-production. While national archives help to structure knowledge through a state-sanctioned narrative, decolonial DH methodologies seek to address the silences not only in digital scholarship, but also in the official archive.\nDrawing on Women of Color (WOC) theory such as Chela Sandoval’s <em>Methodology of the Oppressed</em> (2000), I discuss the digital implications and applications of “oppositional consciousness” and Affect theory. In this talk, I focus on the emerging US Latina/o Digital Humanities initiative at the Recovering the US Hispanic Literary Heritage project (aka “Recovery”) in order to examine structural colonial problems encountered in US Latina/o DH and the stakes of digital decolonial praxis.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Lorena Gauthereau Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Elaborating a (Digital) Methodology of the Oppressed in US Latina/o Digital Humanities","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2018-09-25T16:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Lorena Gauthereau","website":null,"twitter":"LGauth19 ","slug":"lorena-gauthereau","new_id":487,"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#e8e8e8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/7e5b5c1b217a58bbfc848430c14c39b7/63b94/Lorena-12-copy..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/7e5b5c1b217a58bbfc848430c14c39b7/e9dd8/Lorena-12-copy..jpg 608w,\n/mith-static/static/7e5b5c1b217a58bbfc848430c14c39b7/7ce5a/Lorena-12-copy..jpg 1215w,\n/mith-static/static/7e5b5c1b217a58bbfc848430c14c39b7/63b94/Lorena-12-copy..jpg 2430w","sizes":"(min-width: 2430px) 2430px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/7e5b5c1b217a58bbfc848430c14c39b7/844f0/Lorena-12-copy..webp 608w,\n/mith-static/static/7e5b5c1b217a58bbfc848430c14c39b7/ee6da/Lorena-12-copy..webp 1215w,\n/mith-static/static/7e5b5c1b217a58bbfc848430c14c39b7/03f5f/Lorena-12-copy..webp 2430w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 2430px) 2430px, 100vw"}]},"width":2430,"height":3645}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"department":null,"institution":"University of Houston","title":"CLIR-Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow, Recovering the US Hispanic Literary Heritage","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"lorena-gauthereau"}}]}}]}}],"linked_links":[{"data":{"id":272,"title":"Powerpoint Slides","url":"https://archive.mith.umd.edu/mith-2020/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Gauthereau_MITHdd-compressed.pdf","type":"attachment"}}],"video_id":"291987218","video_url":"https://vimeo.com/mithinmd/drgauthereau","livestream":null,"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"department":null,"institution":"University of Houston","title":"CLIR-Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow, Recovering the US Hispanic Literary Heritage","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"lorena-gauthereau"}}]}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
