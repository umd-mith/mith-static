However, by visualizing certain of its patterns–by looking at the text “from a distance”–through textual analytics and visualizations, one can read the novel in ways formerly impossible and re-evaluate whether there is or is not “a there there.” This talk will focus on how various analytic methods (such as text mining and frequent pattern recognition) and visualization tools (such as FeatureLens and Spotfire) under research in the <a href=\"http://www.monkproject.org/\">MONK project</a> have been used to achieve a new *non*-reading of the text which Stein called her “masterpiece” and critiques called “linguistic murder.”</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Tanya Clement Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Using Digital Tools to Not-Read Gertrude Stein’s \"The Making of Americans\"","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2007-09-11T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2007-09-11T17:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"name":"Tanya Clement","affiliations":[{"title":"PhD Candidate","department":"Department of English","institution":"University of Maryland"}],"website":null,"twitter":null,"slug":"tanya-clement","new_id":96,"headshot":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#b8b8c8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/d9994bd55d288fe86caeebb92c384ece/3c367/5KHoZj9xdUuYfgbuMi-anLZu7QJAyOpFCuz39ihj6hg.jpg","srcSet":"/static/d9994bd55d288fe86caeebb92c384ece/19e71/5KHoZj9xdUuYfgbuMi-anLZu7QJAyOpFCuz39ihj6hg.jpg 128w,\n/static/d9994bd55d288fe86caeebb92c384ece/68974/5KHoZj9xdUuYfgbuMi-anLZu7QJAyOpFCuz39ihj6hg.jpg 256w,\n/static/d9994bd55d288fe86caeebb92c384ece/3c367/5KHoZj9xdUuYfgbuMi-anLZu7QJAyOpFCuz39ihj6hg.jpg 512w","sizes":"(min-width: 512px) 512px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/d9994bd55d288fe86caeebb92c384ece/6766a/5KHoZj9xdUuYfgbuMi-anLZu7QJAyOpFCuz39ihj6hg.webp 128w,\n/static/d9994bd55d288fe86caeebb92c384ece/22bfc/5KHoZj9xdUuYfgbuMi-anLZu7QJAyOpFCuz39ihj6hg.webp 256w,\n/static/d9994bd55d288fe86caeebb92c384ece/d689f/5KHoZj9xdUuYfgbuMi-anLZu7QJAyOpFCuz39ihj6hg.webp 512w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 512px) 512px, 100vw"}]},"width":512,"height":512}}},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Helming from the English Department Tanya Clement's dissertation, <em>The Making of Digital Modernism: Re-reading Modernist Texts with Computer-Assisted Analysis</em>, is genuinely groundbreaking and will contribute new readings and new knowledge to the scholarship on Gertrude Stein as well as a lesser-known figure, the Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven (who was pivotal in the American Dadaist movement).
