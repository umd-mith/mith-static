I argue that digital humanities is a fandom – and that there is much to learn from attending to its processes and practices through the lenses developed both by fan studies scholars and by fans themselves. Participants in creative fan communities have theorized their own knowledge production as in conversation with, yet distinct from both media industrial and academic models; drawing from these approaches enables us to understand “digital humanities” as a phenomenon that need not be contained within the bounds of the academy. Drawing attention to the examples of the fannish nonprofit Organization for Transformative Works and the digital humanities network #transformDH, I will pay special attention to the theory and praxis of critical fandom: the ways in which members of fan communities use diverse creative techniques to challenge and critique the structures and representations around which their communities are organized. Understanding digital humanities as critical fandom makes it possible to focus on the affective dimensions that shape it and the contradictory logics that permeate its relationship to the disciplines and institutions that provide its context.</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Alexis Lothian Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"From Transformative Works to #transformDH","talk_subtitle":"Digital Humanities as (Critical) Fandom","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2014-10-21T16:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"name":"Alexis Lothian","affiliations":[{"title":"Assistant Professor of Women’s Studies","department":null,"institution":"University of Maryland"}],"website":"https://wgss.umd.edu/directory/alexis-lothian","twitter":"alothian","slug":"alexis-lothian","new_id":15,"headshot":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/fa6b958ede78ba9e36b1d0ce1911c4ae/30f07/Ru6xcxJhyyeEpxxNdSCXFYLlf8_AXsU8EekwnkoawMg.jpg","srcSet":"/static/fa6b958ede78ba9e36b1d0ce1911c4ae/41624/Ru6xcxJhyyeEpxxNdSCXFYLlf8_AXsU8EekwnkoawMg.jpg 160w,\n/static/fa6b958ede78ba9e36b1d0ce1911c4ae/1b894/Ru6xcxJhyyeEpxxNdSCXFYLlf8_AXsU8EekwnkoawMg.jpg 320w,\n/static/fa6b958ede78ba9e36b1d0ce1911c4ae/30f07/Ru6xcxJhyyeEpxxNdSCXFYLlf8_AXsU8EekwnkoawMg.jpg 640w","sizes":"(min-width: 640px) 640px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/fa6b958ede78ba9e36b1d0ce1911c4ae/60b4d/Ru6xcxJhyyeEpxxNdSCXFYLlf8_AXsU8EekwnkoawMg.webp 160w,\n/static/fa6b958ede78ba9e36b1d0ce1911c4ae/5e011/Ru6xcxJhyyeEpxxNdSCXFYLlf8_AXsU8EekwnkoawMg.webp 320w,\n/static/fa6b958ede78ba9e36b1d0ce1911c4ae/90d07/Ru6xcxJhyyeEpxxNdSCXFYLlf8_AXsU8EekwnkoawMg.webp 640w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 640px) 640px, 100vw"}]},"width":640,"height":640}}},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Alexis Lothian is a interdisciplinary scholar of queer and feminist media and cultural studies with a focus on speculative fiction, digital media, and online fandom.
