In this talk, Professor Mills Kelly, Associate Director of the Center for History and New Media, will discuss the results of a recent course he taught called \"Lying About the Past\" in which his students created an online historical hoax that fooled a fair number of people (including several professors).

What lessons can we learn about teaching and digital culture from his experiences? Come to the talk and find out.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Mills Kelly Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"What Happens When You Teach Students to Lie Online?","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2009-04-21T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2009-04-21T17:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Mills  Kelly","website":null,"twitter":null,"slug":"mills-kelly","new_id":504,"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"department":null,"institution":"George Mason University","title":"Associate Dean for Enrollment Development","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"mills-kelly"}}]}}]}}],"linked_links":null,"video_id":null,"video_url":null,"livestream":null,"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"department":null,"institution":"George Mason University","title":"Associate Dean for Enrollment Development","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"mills-kelly"}}]}},{"data":{"department":"Center for History and New Media","institution":"George Mason University","title":"Associate Director","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"mills-kelly"}}]}},{"data":{"department":"Department of History and Art History","institution":"George Mason University","title":"Associate Professor","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"mills-kelly"}}]}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
