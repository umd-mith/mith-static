Drawing together environmental studies, digital media studies, and sound studies, Dr. Moro's talk explores these radio atmospheric signals, or \"sferics,\" across a range of artistic and scientific practices, from random number generation to cryptocurrency to field recordings. He argues that even as artists idealize sferics as a direct path to a kind of planetary unconscious, there remain attempts to incorporate sferics into existing cultural models of environmental data. These models, which his talk tracks across the work of sonic and digital artists who deploy sferics within their work, insist that environmental phenomena, no matter how immaterial, serve some aspect of human productivity.\nThis talk will be of particular interest to those working across the sciences and media arts, as well as anyone who has ever wondered what's hiding behind the static between radio stations.</p>\n<p>Register to attend at: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/ddsp24-moro-c\">bit.ly/ddsp24-moro-c</a></p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Jeffrey Moro Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Sensing Sferics","talk_subtitle":"Electromagnetic Noise and Environmental Signal","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2024-05-07T21:15:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Jeffrey  Moro","website":"https://jeffreymoro.com/","twitter":"jeffreymoro","slug":"jeffrey-moro","new_id":180,"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#687868","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/e8e1e3bbdec68122cb3b931f69940684/be5ed/Jeffrey-Photo..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/e8e1e3bbdec68122cb3b931f69940684/8bb35/Jeffrey-Photo..jpg 125w,\n/mith-static/static/e8e1e3bbdec68122cb3b931f69940684/f505e/Jeffrey-Photo..jpg 250w,\n/mith-static/static/e8e1e3bbdec68122cb3b931f69940684/be5ed/Jeffrey-Photo..jpg 500w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/e8e1e3bbdec68122cb3b931f69940684/d66e1/Jeffrey-Photo..webp 125w,\n/mith-static/static/e8e1e3bbdec68122cb3b931f69940684/e7160/Jeffrey-Photo..webp 250w,\n/mith-static/static/e8e1e3bbdec68122cb3b931f69940684/5f169/Jeffrey-Photo..webp 500w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"}]},"width":500,"height":500}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Jeffrey Moro is a Assistant Clinical Professor with the African American Digital and Experimental Humanities (AADHum) Initiative at the University of Maryland.
