The conceptual focus of my work is instead the development and portrayal of situations of a specifically vague nature. To this end, I create computer generated sequences of video and audio which situate themselves somewhere between a specific narrative, and a non-event. These video components are then integrated into sculptural or installation settings to exist as multi-channel video objects.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Brandon Morse Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Artist's Talk","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2007-02-13T17:30:00.000Z","end":"2007-02-13T18:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Brandon Morse","website":null,"twitter":null,"slug":"brandon-morse","new_id":396,"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#b8a898","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/b090f1ae49c60c57461c49d1cf8d23d1/12faa/profile_photo_brandon_morse..jpg","srcSet":"/static/b090f1ae49c60c57461c49d1cf8d23d1/cd0aa/profile_photo_brandon_morse..jpg 580w,\n/static/b090f1ae49c60c57461c49d1cf8d23d1/38d0c/profile_photo_brandon_morse..jpg 1160w,\n/static/b090f1ae49c60c57461c49d1cf8d23d1/12faa/profile_photo_brandon_morse..jpg 2320w","sizes":"(min-width: 2320px) 2320px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/b090f1ae49c60c57461c49d1cf8d23d1/f5f74/profile_photo_brandon_morse..webp 580w,\n/static/b090f1ae49c60c57461c49d1cf8d23d1/ef17b/profile_photo_brandon_morse..webp 1160w,\n/static/b090f1ae49c60c57461c49d1cf8d23d1/3a13d/profile_photo_brandon_morse..webp 2320w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 2320px) 2320px, 100vw"}]},"width":2320,"height":2832}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Brandon Morse is a Washington, DC based artist who works with generative systems as a means to examine the ways in which physical phenomena such as entropy and emergence can function in ways that are both poetic and metaphorical.
