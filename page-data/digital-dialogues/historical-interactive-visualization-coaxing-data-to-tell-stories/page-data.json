The projects were built using an NEH-funded visualization authoring tool, <a href=\"http://www.viseyes.org/\">VisualEyes</a>, developed at UVa.<a href=\"http://www.viseyes.org/\">VisualEyes</a> enables scholars to present selected primary source materials and research findings while encouraging active inquiry and hands-on learning among general and targeted audiences. It communicates through the use of dynamic displays that organize and present meaningful information in both traditional and multimedia formats, such as audio-video, animation, charts, maps, data, and interactive timelines.\nI will also show a number of student-generated visualizations, created in the context of undergraduate project-based learning (PBL) seminars, and discuss how visualization and PBL are strong partners to promote historical inquiry. As a consequence, I have developed a new model to help scaffold the design of data-driven interactive projects called ASSERT. <em>Ask</em> a question; <em>Search</em> for evidence to answer that question; <em>Structure</em> the data; <em>Envision</em> ways to answer the question using the structured data; <em>Represent</em> that data in a compelling interactive manner; and finally, <em>Tell</em> a story using that data to answer the question.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Bill Ferster Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Historical Interactive Visualization","talk_subtitle":"Coaxing Data to Tell Stories","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2012-04-03T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2012-04-03T17:45:00.000Z","location":"2117 Hornbake, South Wing (HCIL)","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Bill  Ferster","website":null,"twitter":null,"slug":"bill-ferster","new_id":393,"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/bc1d709ccc11c290c5fbab96af40f9be/e9891/billpic20101..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/bc1d709ccc11c290c5fbab96af40f9be/b6917/billpic20101..jpg 90w,\n/mith-static/static/bc1d709ccc11c290c5fbab96af40f9be/12efe/billpic20101..jpg 180w,\n/mith-static/static/bc1d709ccc11c290c5fbab96af40f9be/e9891/billpic20101..jpg 360w","sizes":"(min-width: 360px) 360px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/bc1d709ccc11c290c5fbab96af40f9be/8b6e2/billpic20101..webp 90w,\n/mith-static/static/bc1d709ccc11c290c5fbab96af40f9be/b479a/billpic20101..webp 180w,\n/mith-static/static/bc1d709ccc11c290c5fbab96af40f9be/6547a/billpic20101..webp 360w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 360px) 360px, 100vw"}]},"width":360,"height":423}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p><strong>Bill Ferster</strong> directs the <a href=\"www.viseyes.org\">VisualEyes Project</a> at the University of Virginia with a joint faculty appointment with the Center for Technology and Teacher Education at the Curry School of Education, and with the Sciences, Humanities &#x26; Arts Technology Initiative (SHANTI) at the College of Arts and Sciences.
