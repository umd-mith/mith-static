In this talk, I take up a new materialist approach to murder, arguing, first, that we must begin by postponing blame, and, second, that inner-city murder is distributed through multiple key non-human rhetorical agents before and leading up to the violent act itself–and that any meaningful intervention must first account for and trace these agents. Using new materialist rhetoric, affect theory, and discourse analysis, I share my research on murder as it happens across, and in part because of, the partial agency of social networks, where language, discourse, and affect intra-act and resonate contagiously. Through a case study of a 2014 “murder-event” in Pittsburgh, PA, I illustrate how Facebook and Twitter become agential actors in murder themselves. Ultimately, my research suggests that individual agency is no longer sufficient and that we must, instead listen to other powerful rhetorical agents and their networks, which have thus far been excluded, as a new intervention into violence in the 21st century.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Trisha Campbell Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Murder Networks","talk_subtitle":"A New Materialist Look at Violence","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2015-11-10T17:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Trisha Campbell","website":"https://digitaltrishacampbell.com","twitter":"digitaltrisha ","slug":"trisha-campbell","new_id":546,"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#d8d8d8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/3f2e17be5169b6ca2e41a963af4dd8e4/918cc/Trisha-Campbell2..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/3f2e17be5169b6ca2e41a963af4dd8e4/8a962/Trisha-Campbell2..jpg 290w,\n/mith-static/static/3f2e17be5169b6ca2e41a963af4dd8e4/a5f13/Trisha-Campbell2..jpg 580w,\n/mith-static/static/3f2e17be5169b6ca2e41a963af4dd8e4/918cc/Trisha-Campbell2..jpg 1160w","sizes":"(min-width: 1160px) 1160px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/3f2e17be5169b6ca2e41a963af4dd8e4/08598/Trisha-Campbell2..webp 290w,\n/mith-static/static/3f2e17be5169b6ca2e41a963af4dd8e4/fad4c/Trisha-Campbell2..webp 580w,\n/mith-static/static/3f2e17be5169b6ca2e41a963af4dd8e4/b8404/Trisha-Campbell2..webp 1160w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1160px) 1160px, 100vw"}]},"width":1160,"height":1044}}},{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#a89888","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/81fdd3b4ca77071d2d6b2a547511f741/7fcea/Trisha-Campbell..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/81fdd3b4ca77071d2d6b2a547511f741/c4749/Trisha-Campbell..jpg 44w,\n/mith-static/static/81fdd3b4ca77071d2d6b2a547511f741/75bf5/Trisha-Campbell..jpg 88w,\n/mith-static/static/81fdd3b4ca77071d2d6b2a547511f741/7fcea/Trisha-Campbell..jpg 175w","sizes":"(min-width: 175px) 175px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/81fdd3b4ca77071d2d6b2a547511f741/c47ab/Trisha-Campbell..webp 44w,\n/mith-static/static/81fdd3b4ca77071d2d6b2a547511f741/0cdfc/Trisha-Campbell..webp 88w,\n/mith-static/static/81fdd3b4ca77071d2d6b2a547511f741/fdfef/Trisha-Campbell..webp 175w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 175px) 175px, 100vw"}]},"width":175,"height":207}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"department":"Department of English","institution":"Salisbury University","title":"Assistant Professor","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"trisha-campbell"}}]}}]}}],"linked_links":[{"data":{"id":217,"title":"View Storify","url":"https://storify.com/digdialog/trisha-campbell-digital-dialogue-at-mith-november-","type":"file_link"}}],"video_id":"145652528","video_url":"https://vimeo.com/145652528","livestream":null,"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"department":"Department of English","institution":"Salisbury University","title":"Assistant Professor","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"trisha-campbell"}}]}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
