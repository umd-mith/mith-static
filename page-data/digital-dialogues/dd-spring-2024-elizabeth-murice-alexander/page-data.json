In this presentation, Alexander examines the use of interactive media for Black community worldbuilding and presents her own work in this area. <em>WILDWOOD</em>, a Black solarpunk digital gamebook, visions life in a rewilded future version of West Englewood, a neighborhood on the southside of Chicago. In the game, Alexander incorporates elements of choose-your-own-adventure storytelling and tabletop gaming to explore community histories and futures through adventures in Black speculative worldbuilding, while also experimenting with hypertext fiction and AI image generation as digital placemaking tools. As such, <em>WILDWOOD</em> offers tools to write future visions of Black communities, and space to enact these visions through digital play.</p>\n<p>Register to attend at <a href=\"http://bit.ly/ddsp24-alexander-registration\">bit.ly/ddsp24-alexander-registration</a></p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Elizabeth Murice Alexander Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"WILDWOOD","talk_subtitle":"BlackDH Adventures in Southside Chicago Worldmaking","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2024-03-26T16:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Elizabeth Murice  Alexander","website":"http://emaphd.com","twitter":"blkvibration","slug":"elizabeth-murice-alexander","new_id":629,"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#282808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/ee42d94e5c13a1b11678906e1caa37f1/54ed5/LMA_february-2022..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/ee42d94e5c13a1b11678906e1caa37f1/e2e35/LMA_february-2022..jpg 518w,\n/mith-static/static/ee42d94e5c13a1b11678906e1caa37f1/dbdaf/LMA_february-2022..jpg 1036w,\n/mith-static/static/ee42d94e5c13a1b11678906e1caa37f1/54ed5/LMA_february-2022..jpg 2071w","sizes":"(min-width: 2071px) 2071px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/ee42d94e5c13a1b11678906e1caa37f1/da710/LMA_february-2022..webp 518w,\n/mith-static/static/ee42d94e5c13a1b11678906e1caa37f1/c4425/LMA_february-2022..webp 1036w,\n/mith-static/static/ee42d94e5c13a1b11678906e1caa37f1/2f521/LMA_february-2022..webp 2071w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 2071px) 2071px, 100vw"}]},"width":2071,"height":2071}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Elizabeth Murice Alexander is an Assistant Clinical Professor of Digital Humanities and Digital Studies at African American Digital &#x26; Experimental Humanities (AADHum), housed in the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH) at the University of Maryland, College Park.\nElizabeth designs and develops across digital &#x26; print media, with a critical and creative research practice focused on Black women’s technoculture, the embodied lifecycles of cultural and personal data, and the Southwest Side of Chicago.
