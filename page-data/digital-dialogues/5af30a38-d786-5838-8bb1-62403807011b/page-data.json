He dubbed the whole thing the Mundaneum, describing it as a \"r√©seau mondial\" -- a worldwide web. Why should anyone still pay attention to the failed schemes of a long-dead Belgian bibliographer? Otlet's work matters today not just as a kind of historical curio, but because he envisioned a radically different kind of network: one driven not by corporate profit and personal vanity, but by a utopian vision of intellectual progress, social egalitarianism, and even spiritual liberation. This presentation will delve deep into Otlet's alternative vision of a global network, in search of useful lessons that could reshape our understanding of what the Web could yet become.</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Alex Wright Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"The Platonic Network","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2014-11-11T17:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"name":"Alex Wright","affiliations":[{"title":"Director of Research","department":null,"institution":"Etsy"}],"website":"http://alexwright.org","twitter":"alexgrantwright","slug":"alex-wright","new_id":373,"headshot":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#787878","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/b37177aa16cabe1a98d1f78b6860fc40/d085b/BrcPLeBk6mboBJ_peN3ms5mHa8n_0HLYI1q9i5b6M3Y.jpg","srcSet":"/static/b37177aa16cabe1a98d1f78b6860fc40/3339a/BrcPLeBk6mboBJ_peN3ms5mHa8n_0HLYI1q9i5b6M3Y.jpg 112w,\n/static/b37177aa16cabe1a98d1f78b6860fc40/22333/BrcPLeBk6mboBJ_peN3ms5mHa8n_0HLYI1q9i5b6M3Y.jpg 223w,\n/static/b37177aa16cabe1a98d1f78b6860fc40/d085b/BrcPLeBk6mboBJ_peN3ms5mHa8n_0HLYI1q9i5b6M3Y.jpg 446w","sizes":"(min-width: 446px) 446px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/b37177aa16cabe1a98d1f78b6860fc40/537ff/BrcPLeBk6mboBJ_peN3ms5mHa8n_0HLYI1q9i5b6M3Y.webp 112w,\n/static/b37177aa16cabe1a98d1f78b6860fc40/22793/BrcPLeBk6mboBJ_peN3ms5mHa8n_0HLYI1q9i5b6M3Y.webp 223w,\n/static/b37177aa16cabe1a98d1f78b6860fc40/9f255/BrcPLeBk6mboBJ_peN3ms5mHa8n_0HLYI1q9i5b6M3Y.webp 446w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 446px) 446px, 100vw"}]},"width":446,"height":372}}},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Alex Wright is the Director of Research at Etsy and the former Director of User Experience and Product Research at The New York Times.
