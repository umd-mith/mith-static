The goal is to develop improved software and user interfaces that empower diverse users in the sciences and arts to be more productive, and more innovative. Potential users include a combination of software and other engineers, diverse scientists, product and graphic designers, and architects, as well as writers, poets, musicians, new media artists, and many others.\nEnhanced interfaces could enable more effective searching of intellectual resources, improved collaboration among teams, and more rapid discovery processes. These advanced interfaces should also provide potent support in goal setting, speedier exploration of alternatives, improved understanding through visualization, and better dissemination of results. For creative endeavors that require composition of novel artifacts (computer programs, engineering diagrams, symphonies, animations, artwork), enhanced interfaces could facilitate rapid exploration of alternatives, prevent unproductive choices, and enable easy backtracking.\nThis NSF-sponsored workshop (June 2005, <a href=\"http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/CST\">www.cs.umd.edu</a>) brought together 25 research leaders and graduate students to share experiences, identify opportunities, and formulate research challenges. Two key outcomes emerged:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Formulation of guidelines for design of creativity support tools.</li>\n<li>Novel research methods to assess creativity support tools.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The next step is planning for the June 2007 Conference on Creativity and Cognition in Washington, DC. The talk is also meant to invite participation in organizing this event.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Ben Shneiderman Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Creativity and Computing","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2006-02-21T17:30:00.000Z","end":"2006-02-21T18:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Ben  Shneiderman","website":null,"twitter":null,"slug":"ben-shneiderman","new_id":211,"affiliations":[{"data":{"department":"Department of Computer Science","institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Professor","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":null,"slug":"ben-shneiderman"}}]}}]}}],"linked_links":null,"video_id":null,"video_url":null,"livestream":null,"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"department":"Department of Computer Science","institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Professor","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":null,"slug":"ben-shneiderman"}}]}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["196133661","2857345991"],"slicesMap":{}}
