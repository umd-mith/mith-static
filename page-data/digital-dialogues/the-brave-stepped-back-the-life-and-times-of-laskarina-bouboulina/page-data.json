Drawing on documents housed at the General Archives in Athens, the Spetses museum, and interviews with specialists in the areas of Greek and Turkish history and culture, including Bouboulina's own fifth-generation grandson, this hour-long documentary film presents a vivid portrait of one of Greece's most extraordinary heroines.
