The game ran for three months, both on-line and in the real world, and attracted over 6,000 players. Goodlander will present an overview of the game, from a tattooed bodybuilder to the display of fake artifacts, with a discussion of the successes and failures encountered along the way. The talk will also include a sneak peak at the museum's plans for a future ARG.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Georgina Goodlander Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Ghosts of a Chance: A Museum-Based Alternate Reality Game","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2009-12-15T17:30:00.000Z","end":"2009-12-15T18:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Georgina  Goodlander","website":"countedshadows.com/wordpress","twitter":"bathlander","slug":"georgina-goodlander","new_id":432,"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#b87848","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/285a204f93e44adaaf0ec56127c8beeb/6b029/Georgina-Goodlander..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/285a204f93e44adaaf0ec56127c8beeb/b7424/Georgina-Goodlander..jpg 63w,\n/mith-static/static/285a204f93e44adaaf0ec56127c8beeb/cac70/Georgina-Goodlander..jpg 125w,\n/mith-static/static/285a204f93e44adaaf0ec56127c8beeb/6b029/Georgina-Goodlander..jpg 250w","sizes":"(min-width: 250px) 250px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/285a204f93e44adaaf0ec56127c8beeb/b0844/Georgina-Goodlander..webp 63w,\n/mith-static/static/285a204f93e44adaaf0ec56127c8beeb/44a0c/Georgina-Goodlander..webp 125w,\n/mith-static/static/285a204f93e44adaaf0ec56127c8beeb/38cd7/Georgina-Goodlander..webp 250w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 250px) 250px, 100vw"}]},"width":250,"height":267}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p><strong>Georgina Bath Goodlander</strong> is the Interpretive Programs Manager of the Luce Foundation Center for American Art at the Smithsonian Institution.
