Foundational to our embodied experience of place are the ways in which we represent and visualize space. From crowdsourced maps to urban markup, mobile technologies are intervening in the ways we visualize our interactions with place. Focusing on examples such as the augmented reality applications Street Museum and Twitter 360, the emotion maps in Christian Nold's Biomapping, and the crowdsourced maps created of Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, this study elaborates on the ways that representations of spaces created with mobile technologies reinstill the integral link between embodied action and the production of space.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Jason Farman Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Mapping the Mobile Interface","talk_subtitle":"Geolocation Meets Visualization","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2010-10-12T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2010-10-12T17:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Jason  Farman","website":"http://jasonfarman.com/","twitter":null,"slug":"jason-farman","new_id":18,"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/dd5677cea546ae9ef73102a593f4cccd/baaed/jason-farman..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/dd5677cea546ae9ef73102a593f4cccd/dd515/jason-farman..jpg 200w,\n/mith-static/static/dd5677cea546ae9ef73102a593f4cccd/47930/jason-farman..jpg 400w,\n/mith-static/static/dd5677cea546ae9ef73102a593f4cccd/baaed/jason-farman..jpg 800w","sizes":"(min-width: 800px) 800px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/dd5677cea546ae9ef73102a593f4cccd/2e34e/jason-farman..webp 200w,\n/mith-static/static/dd5677cea546ae9ef73102a593f4cccd/416c3/jason-farman..webp 400w,\n/mith-static/static/dd5677cea546ae9ef73102a593f4cccd/c1587/jason-farman..webp 800w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 800px) 800px, 100vw"}]},"width":800,"height":800}}}]},"affiliations":[{"data":{"department":"Department of American Studies","institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Assistant Professor","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":null,"slug":"jason-farman"}}]}}]}}],"linked_links":null,"video_id":"178064968","video_url":"https://vimeo.com/178064968","livestream":null,"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"department":"Department of American Studies","institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Assistant Professor","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":null,"slug":"jason-farman"}}]}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["196133661","2857345991"],"slicesMap":{}}
