The chats started with queries that then influenced deeper dialogue on how scholars and activists together could use history to inform a world specifically void of policing and incarceration. Both projects hinged on collective engagement with a few questions (and critiques) to incubate new ideas on how to present and preserve Black history with Black futures in mind. While both projects happened online, low-tech methodologies deeply informed project decisions. Phone calls, in-person meetings and printed chats played an important role in shaping the project. There was a heavy emphasis on the public, but the projects influenced the personal in ways that ultimately led to Museums Respond to Ferguson’s end and #BlkTwitterstorians refocus.\nThis presentation will also include a demonstration, inviting participants to walk through constructing a dialogue on Twitter: preparation, rules for engagement, reflecting, and planning for archiving and dissemination.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Aleia Brown Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Ctrl Alt Delete: Rebooting Narratives through Digital Humanities","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2018-10-09T16:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Aleia  Brown","website":null,"twitter":"CollardStudies","slug":"aleia-brown","new_id":4,"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/5ec13cc7e971e9d7394446280b5a91a3/5a7c3/aleia-brown..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/5ec13cc7e971e9d7394446280b5a91a3/f505e/aleia-brown..jpg 250w,\n/mith-static/static/5ec13cc7e971e9d7394446280b5a91a3/be5ed/aleia-brown..jpg 500w,\n/mith-static/static/5ec13cc7e971e9d7394446280b5a91a3/5a7c3/aleia-brown..jpg 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/5ec13cc7e971e9d7394446280b5a91a3/e7160/aleia-brown..webp 250w,\n/mith-static/static/5ec13cc7e971e9d7394446280b5a91a3/5f169/aleia-brown..webp 500w,\n/mith-static/static/5ec13cc7e971e9d7394446280b5a91a3/3cd29/aleia-brown..webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":1000}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Aleia M.
