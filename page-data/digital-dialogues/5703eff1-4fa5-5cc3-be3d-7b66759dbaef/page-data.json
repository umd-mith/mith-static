It was these architects who literally built the infrastructure of imperialist expansion in the East, as well was the brutal complementary structures of the Jewish genocide. This talk analyzes the documentary evidence of the imperial ambitions of the SS as well as the digital visualizations of that archival evidence. Building off of his current work on digitally mapping the site (with his co-author, Anne Kelly Knowles), Jaskot asks what is at stake for digital mapping in the humanities, as well as for a spatial and architectural understanding of the Holocaust.\n________\n<em>Please note that this Digital Dialogue is a special co-sponsored talk in conjunction the Art History &#x26; Archaeology Department, and occurs on a different weekday and location.

Mellon Professor at the Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts (National Gallery). His specific area of research has mostly focused on the cultural history of National Socialist Germany and its postwar impact on art and architecture. He has published a number of essays that explored the political function of architecture in the modern period, leading up to his most recent book <em>The Nazi Perpetrator: Postwar German Art and the Politics of the Right</em> (Minnesota 2012). These interests have also led to his involvement over the past decade with the Holocaust Geography Collaborative, a coalition of 8 international scholars who specialize in both Holocaust Studies and GIS. Their research has most recently resulted in the anthology <em>Geographies of the Holocaust</em> (2014) for which Jaskot co-authored three chapters. He is currently exploring with Anne Kelly Knowles the potential for using Historical GIS to explore issues of forced labor and the construction industry in Nazi Germany. In addition to his research, Jaskot has served as President of the College Art Association (2008â€“2010).</p>"}}}],"links":[],"video_id":"126825421","video_url":"https://vimeo.com/126825421","livestream":null,"sponsors":[{"name":"Department of Art History and Archaeology","website":null,"type":"Internal","slug":"dept_arthist_arch"}],"partners":[],"disciplines":[],"methods":[]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
