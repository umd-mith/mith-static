BLT engages in the production of discursive spaces wherein artists and community members engage in dialogue on a variety of critical issues. BLT roundtable events provide physical and digital infrastructure for community discourse, which is recorded and archived on the BLT website. Parallel to its creation of physical spaces that foster community and generate critical dialogue, BLT is creating a digital space for a Linked Open Data (LOD) approach to Black studies and social justice issues. BLT's use of network analysis, as an organizing principle for its archive, is an innovative application of DH methods that disrupts traditional archiving practices.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Jina Valentine, Heather Hart Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"The Black Lunch Table Archive : A Radical Reimagining of Digital Authorship","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2020-03-03T17:30:00.000Z","end":null,"location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Jina Valentine","website":null,"twitter":"fishantena","slug":"jina-valentine","new_id":458,"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#e8e8d8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/495649aec8683a5a000364b320729161/baaed/jina-valentine..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/495649aec8683a5a000364b320729161/dd515/jina-valentine..jpg 200w,\n/mith-static/static/495649aec8683a5a000364b320729161/47930/jina-valentine..jpg 400w,\n/mith-static/static/495649aec8683a5a000364b320729161/baaed/jina-valentine..jpg 800w","sizes":"(min-width: 800px) 800px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/495649aec8683a5a000364b320729161/2e34e/jina-valentine..webp 200w,\n/mith-static/static/495649aec8683a5a000364b320729161/416c3/jina-valentine..webp 400w,\n/mith-static/static/495649aec8683a5a000364b320729161/c1587/jina-valentine..webp 800w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 800px) 800px, 100vw"}]},"width":800,"height":800}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Based in Chicago, Jina Valentine is a visual artist and Associate Professor of Printmedia at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (previously UNC Chapel Hill).
