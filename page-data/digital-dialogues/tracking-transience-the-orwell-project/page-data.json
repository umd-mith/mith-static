After an erroneous tip called into law enforcement authorities in 2002, Elahi was subjected to an intensive post 9-11 investigation by the FBI. After undergoing six months of interrogations and nine consecutive lie-detector tests, he was cleared of suspicions. After this harrowing experience, Elahi conceived \"<a href=\"http://trackingtransience.net\">Tracking Transience</a>\", a self-tracking system that constantly and publicly presents his exact location, activities, and other personal data. This self-surveillance project is a critique of contemporary investigative techniques and provides an ongoing \"alibi\" for Elahi in the event of future accusations.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Hasan Elahi Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Tracking Transience","talk_subtitle":"The Orwell Project","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2010-10-26T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2010-10-26T17:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Hasan Elahi","website":"http://elahi.umd.edu/track","twitter":"hasanmelahi","slug":"hasan-elahi","new_id":437,"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#282828","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/83134928674013248866d1d44be44120/0b8ee/hasan-elahi..jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/83134928674013248866d1d44be44120/8a803/hasan-elahi..jpg 148w,\n/mith-static/static/83134928674013248866d1d44be44120/7550e/hasan-elahi..jpg 295w,\n/mith-static/static/83134928674013248866d1d44be44120/0b8ee/hasan-elahi..jpg 590w","sizes":"(min-width: 590px) 590px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/83134928674013248866d1d44be44120/077e2/hasan-elahi..webp 148w,\n/mith-static/static/83134928674013248866d1d44be44120/86ef2/hasan-elahi..webp 295w,\n/mith-static/static/83134928674013248866d1d44be44120/48e29/hasan-elahi..webp 590w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 590px) 590px, 100vw"}]},"width":590,"height":300}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"department":null,"institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Associate Professor of Art","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"hasan-elahi"}}]}}]}}],"linked_links":null,"video_id":"178064996","video_url":"https://vimeo.com/178064996","livestream":null,"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"department":null,"institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Associate Professor of Art","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"hasan-elahi"}}]}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
