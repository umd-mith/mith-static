At the center of this nexus of users is the book itself, a virtual artifact that differs from its physical counterpart by being comprised of bits, not atoms; of textures, animated scripts, and geometric primitives rather than paper, ink, cloth, and thread. In this talk I will examine the infrastructure that supports this in-world bibliographic culture: specifically, the technologies used to create and read SL books; the social networks designed to promote and popularize them; the information services to collect, access, curate, and catalogue them; and the legal and economic systems developed to commodify them. I will look at how the Second Life platform conditions our ideas of \"bookness\" by presenting us with interfaces for reading that borrow incongruously from print and manuscript traditions, first-person shooter games, and even military aviation. And I will suggest that the mixed economy of Real Life and Second Life makes it necessary to understand these immersive books as compound objects that exist within a system of relationships that include both in-world and out-world content, thereby complicating efforts to study, link, document, and preserve them. The talk will also include a demonstration of books I have made in SL and discuss future projects.</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Kari Kraus Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Rezzing Books: Codex Technology in the Metaverse","talk_subtitle":null,"type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2008-04-15T16:30:00.000Z","end":"2008-04-15T17:45:00.000Z","location":"MITH Conference Room","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Kari Kraus","website":null,"twitter":null,"slug":"kari-kraus","new_id":293,"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#788848","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/6c75d38bd3b0f6a40bcae61b1afd6ba5/47930/Kari_Kraus_(karikraus)__Twitter..jpg","srcSet":"/static/6c75d38bd3b0f6a40bcae61b1afd6ba5/e07e1/Kari_Kraus_(karikraus)__Twitter..jpg 100w,\n/static/6c75d38bd3b0f6a40bcae61b1afd6ba5/dd515/Kari_Kraus_(karikraus)__Twitter..jpg 200w,\n/static/6c75d38bd3b0f6a40bcae61b1afd6ba5/47930/Kari_Kraus_(karikraus)__Twitter..jpg 400w","sizes":"(min-width: 400px) 400px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/6c75d38bd3b0f6a40bcae61b1afd6ba5/d8057/Kari_Kraus_(karikraus)__Twitter..webp 100w,\n/static/6c75d38bd3b0f6a40bcae61b1afd6ba5/2e34e/Kari_Kraus_(karikraus)__Twitter..webp 200w,\n/static/6c75d38bd3b0f6a40bcae61b1afd6ba5/416c3/Kari_Kraus_(karikraus)__Twitter..webp 400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 400px) 400px, 100vw"}]},"width":400,"height":400}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"department":"College of Information Studies and the Department of English","institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Assistant Professor","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"kari-kraus"}}]}}]}}],"linked_links":null,"video_id":"178956661","video_url":"https://vimeo.com/178956661","livestream":null,"sponsors":null,"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"department":"College of Information Studies and the Department of English","institution":"University of Maryland","title":"Assistant Professor","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"kari-kraus"}}]}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
