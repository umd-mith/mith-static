How does media and mediation affect our sense of agency? I use the example of A Scanner Darkly (dir. Linklater 2006) to discuss the effects of pervasive media and how it affects the parameters of self-reflection and agency. I look at issues surrounding mediated presence (copresence) and the threat to face-to-face engagement that pervasive media implies. The question I ask is: if as a society we are subjected to a pervasive mediation, how may we imagine modes of agency within an animated world?</p>"}},"image":null},"event_title":"Beth Coleman Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Everything is Animated","talk_subtitle":"Pervasive Media and the Networked Subject ","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2011-11-15T17:30:00.000Z","end":"2011-11-15T18:45:00.000Z","location":"Women’s Studies Multimedia Studio, 0135 Taliaferro Hall","speakers":[{"name":"Beth Coleman","affiliations":[{"title":"Assistant Professor of Writing and New Media","department":null,"institution":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}],"website":null,"twitter":"drbethcoleman","slug":"beth-coleman","new_id":390,"headshot":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#a89878","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/mith-static/static/3a471dfc8b7d3ec4d4ca535942b2b8d7/38ea1/beth_coleman.jpg","srcSet":"/mith-static/static/3a471dfc8b7d3ec4d4ca535942b2b8d7/6c52d/beth_coleman.jpg 106w,\n/mith-static/static/3a471dfc8b7d3ec4d4ca535942b2b8d7/21c1c/beth_coleman.jpg 213w,\n/mith-static/static/3a471dfc8b7d3ec4d4ca535942b2b8d7/38ea1/beth_coleman.jpg 425w","sizes":"(min-width: 425px) 425px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/mith-static/static/3a471dfc8b7d3ec4d4ca535942b2b8d7/7dded/beth_coleman.webp 106w,\n/mith-static/static/3a471dfc8b7d3ec4d4ca535942b2b8d7/c0c46/beth_coleman.webp 213w,\n/mith-static/static/3a471dfc8b7d3ec4d4ca535942b2b8d7/da92a/beth_coleman.webp 425w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 425px) 425px, 100vw"}]},"width":425,"height":462}}},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Dr. Beth Coleman’s work focuses on the role of human agency in the context of media and data engagement.
