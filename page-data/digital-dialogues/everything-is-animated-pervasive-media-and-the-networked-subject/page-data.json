How does media and mediation affect our sense of agency? I use the example of A Scanner Darkly (dir. Linklater 2006) to discuss the effects of pervasive media and how it affects the parameters of self-reflection and agency. I look at issues surrounding mediated presence (copresence) and the threat to face-to-face engagement that pervasive media implies. The question I ask is: if as a society we are subjected to a pervasive mediation, how may we imagine modes of agency within an animated world?</p>"}},"image":null,"event_title":"Beth Coleman Digital Dialogue","talk_title":"Everything is Animated","talk_subtitle":"Pervasive Media and the Networked Subject ","type":["Digital Dialogue"],"start":"2011-11-15T17:30:00.000Z","end":"2011-11-15T18:45:00.000Z","location":"Womenâ€™s Studies Multimedia Studio, 0135 Taliaferro Hall","speakers":[{"data":{"name":"Beth Coleman","website":null,"twitter":"drbethcoleman","slug":"beth-coleman","new_id":390,"headshot":{"localFiles":[{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#a89878","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3a471dfc8b7d3ec4d4ca535942b2b8d7/38ea1/beth_coleman..jpg","srcSet":"/static/3a471dfc8b7d3ec4d4ca535942b2b8d7/6c52d/beth_coleman..jpg 106w,\n/static/3a471dfc8b7d3ec4d4ca535942b2b8d7/21c1c/beth_coleman..jpg 213w,\n/static/3a471dfc8b7d3ec4d4ca535942b2b8d7/38ea1/beth_coleman..jpg 425w","sizes":"(min-width: 425px) 425px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/3a471dfc8b7d3ec4d4ca535942b2b8d7/7dded/beth_coleman..webp 106w,\n/static/3a471dfc8b7d3ec4d4ca535942b2b8d7/c0c46/beth_coleman..webp 213w,\n/static/3a471dfc8b7d3ec4d4ca535942b2b8d7/da92a/beth_coleman..webp 425w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 425px) 425px, 100vw"}]},"width":425,"height":462}}}]},"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"affiliations":[{"data":{"department":null,"institution":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology","title":"Assistant Professor of Writing and New Media","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"beth-coleman"}}]}}]}}],"linked_links":[{"data":{"id":166,"title":"Watch Keynote","url":"http://mith.umd.edu/digitaldialogues/slides/dd_2011_11_15.key","type":"file_link"}}],"video_id":"175724859","video_url":"https://vimeo.com/175724859","livestream":null,"sponsors":[{"data":{"name":"Department of Women's Studies","website":null,"type":"Internal","slug":"dept_wmst"}}],"partners":null,"disciplines":null,"methods":null,"speaker_affiliations":[{"data":{"department":null,"institution":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology","title":"Assistant Professor of Writing and New Media","linked_person":[{"data":{"bio":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":""}},"slug":"beth-coleman"}}]}}]}},"staticQueryHashes":["2857345991","3649515864","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
