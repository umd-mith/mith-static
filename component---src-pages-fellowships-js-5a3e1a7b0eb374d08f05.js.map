Proposals should specify how a Winnemore Fellowship would be crucial to the dissertation or equivalent project’s development.

Also encouraged are projects addressing complex ethical issues inherent to engagement with new media, cultural heritage data, and the digital humanities.</p>\n        <p>We will begin accepting applications in Spring 2021 for Spring 2022 fellowships.</p>\n      </section>\n      <section className=\"col-6\">\n        <h2>Clara and Robert Vambery Distinguished Professor of Comparative Studies</h2>\n        <p>In December 1996 the Clara and Robert Vambery Fund was established to honor the memory of Clara Vambery and the significant achievements of Robert Vambery, the dramaturge for the original production of Bertoldt Brecht’s <em>Three Penny Opera</em>, who made substantial contributions to the history of German drama and had an abiding interest in the use of music in the theater.
